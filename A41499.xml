            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat great Law of Nature that hath uttered it ſelf from the Lips of ſome of the Sons thereof, That no man is born for himſelf only, but the reſt of Mankind do challenge a ſhare in him (or rather the whole of him) And this, by the Interpretation of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, is the Sum, or whole of the Second Table of the Decalogue, or Ten Commandments, and contains our whole Duty to our Neighbour, <hi>viz.</hi> That we love him (that is, all men) as our ſelves. This great and Royal Law both of Nature and Grace hath occaſioned this Diſcourſe in thy hand to become publick; The nature of it being ſpiritual and ſublime, carrying much of the peace and inward felicity of men and women in it, hath impoſed a neceſsity upon us not to confine it amongſt our ſelves, but to preſent it to the publick view of all (whoſe hearts ſhall ſerve them to make a diligent and conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous peruſal thereof) for their Accommodation in the things of their Preſent and Everlaſting Peace and Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: For this is certain, that when any man, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb facs="tcp:95016:3"/>of men have any Treaſure in their hands to bleſs the World withal, the Law of God obligeth them to miniſter unto the wants and neceſsities thereof, they being general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo craving by reaſon of that ignorance and darkneſs that men are filled withal.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not need to ſay much as to the Author of this Diſcourſe, nor to the time when theſe things were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by him in the courſe of his Publick Miniſtry, it being ſometime ſince, and we queſtion not but that there are many yet alive of thoſe that heard it, who have not loſt the ſenſe and ſpiritual reſentment thereof, but have many of thoſe great Principles of light and truth remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alive in power and great ſtrength within them, and will be glad of the opportunity of a ſecond review of them. The Author himſelf (which is now at reſt) having fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the work which God judged meet for him, and for which he was ſent into the World, was a man whoſe heart was ſet within him to ſerve his Generation with all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, in the great Work of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, not much val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ng the opprobation, or diſpleaſure of men, when the Intereſt of his great Lord and Maſter, and the preſent Peace, and Everlasting Welfare of men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, being indeed very faithful and laborious in that great Work. So that we may without vanity ſay of him (as our bleſſed Saviour when time was ſaid of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, Joh. 5.35.</hi>) that he was in his time a burning and a ſhining light, and many did much rejoyce (at least for a ſeaſon) in his light, although at ſome times, and ſome turns in the faithful diſcharge of his Duty he met with the ſame meaſure that his great Lord and Master
<pb facs="tcp:95016:3"/>had meaſured out unto him in the daies of his fleſh, <hi>Joh. 6.60, 66.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Subject it ſelf, thou wilt find it as a light to guide thee in a dark place, there being many of the great and gracious Counſels of God concerning men largely ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, eſpecially of ſuch a nature, whereon much of their ſpiritual Welfare doth depend; <hi>viz.</hi> as to the manner and method of the Spirit of God in his proceedings with men; and thoſe Rules and Laws which he hath preſcribed unto himſelf in his advance, and decreaſe in their hearts and ſouls, in order to the carrying them up into the Mount of God. We mean into thoſe high ſtrains of the Goſpel, where the richeſt and choiceſt Conſolations lie, and where men and women may drink abundantly of them, and be thereby put into the beſt capacity to ſerve God upon the higheſt terms of acceptation with himſelf; as alſo, may be great bleſsings and Benefactors to the World round about them, according to the deſign of the Lord Chriſt in that choice which he makes of men by the Goſpel, which as the Apostle <hi>Peter (1 Pet. 2.9.)</hi> ſignifieth, is, the making of them a choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, a holy Nation, a peculiar People, for this very end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, namely, That they might ſhew forth the Praiſes of him who hath called them out of darkneſs into his marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light. The deſign of this Diſcourſe being to carry thee up into the way of life (which the Wiſeman ſaith) is above to the Wiſe, that he may depart from hell beneath, <hi>Prov. 15 24.</hi> which whilest men who love to dwell with their minds and hearts in theſe lower Regions are never like to be partakers of. For this World and the things
<pb facs="tcp:95016:4"/>thereof were never intended by God as that which ſhould anſwer the vaſt deſires of men, he having prepared better things for them, that thoſe noble Endowments of theirs might be converſant with matters of far greater concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch as will advance and raiſe their felicity to a near Affinity and likeneſs with the Angels themſelves, thoſe firſt-born Princes of Heaven, who by beholding the Face of God continually, are thereby filled with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy and ſatisfaction, and by means hereof are made bleſſed indeed: Even ſo God in the Goſpel through his abundant grace ſhines forth the knowledge of himſelf unto the Children of men, that ſo beholding as in a Glaſs his Glory, they may be changed from glory to glory, and be made as like unto him in felicity as far as their nature will bear, in order to the rendring them capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching the World with the ſaving knowledge of the truth where ever they ſhall become; this being one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of felicity, and true greatneſs, and nobleneſs of Spirit (where ever it is) to dilate and utter it ſelf for the real good, benefit, and comfort of all that are round about it, and within its reach. Of theſe things thou hast a large account in the enſuing Treatiſe, both as to the proviſion that is made by God in the Goſpel for his Saints, and thoſe that ſerve him, as likewiſe the nature of him that is the chief Agent (the Holy Ghost) to manage, and to be their Aſsistant in all their ſpiritual Works and Services, which by virtue of the abundant grace of God in the Goſpel they are called unto, and might be partakers of; he being none other than him that hath all Power in his hand both in Heaven and in Earth;
<pb facs="tcp:95016:4"/>Not a Creature, leſt any man ſhould deſpair of ever being ſtrengthened with might in the inner man, or ſhould fear of ever being able to arrive unto that bleſſedneſs which is prepared for thoſe that love God, and wait for the appearance of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: But this Holy Spirit, which thou art adviſed to be filled with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, is no leſs, no other, than the increated Spirit, God bleſſed for ever. Which, in caſe thou haſt but ſuch a ſenſe of thy Salvation, as to be found working of it out with fear and trembling, thou mayeſt aſſure thy ſelf that it is none other than God himſelf, who is both able and willing; yea, is already at work within thee, and will enable thee not only to will, but alſo to do, and that according to his good pleaſure; whoſe will and good pleaſure concerning the manner of his coworking in men is largely opened in this Diſcourſe. And likewiſe his Godhead argued, and with clearneſs proved both by Scriptures and ſound Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. As alſo, thoſe Grounds and Arguments that are commonly brought to prove him to be of a created and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite extraction, punctually, ſedately, and faithfully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; and the Scriptures that are brought to ſerve in that Warfare are diſmiſſed, and diſcharged from that Service: And we look upon this part of the Diſcourſe as ſo much the more ſeaſonable (and we hope a good hand of Divine Providence in bringing of it forth at this time) inaſmuch as that Spirit of Error is now ſtirring more effectually than of latter times, to the endangering of the Everlaſting Welfare of the precious Souls of Men, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Goſpel, and the Grace of God which hath appeared to all Men by Jeſus Chriſt, and that unſpeakable
<pb facs="tcp:95016:5"/>Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit of God, which is to remain with the Saints until his coming again as very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable. Thereby making the neglect of this Grace of God and his good Spirit a thouſand times more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than indeed it is, or is like to be, unto thoſe who ſhall be found to neglect ſo great a ſalvation, that is brought ſo near unto them, and that by God himſelf, with the gracious offer of himſelf, and his own help and aſsiſtance herein. Thou haſt likewiſe an account given thee by what means it is, that the Spirit of God himſelf (if thou ſhalt ſubmit unto his moſt gracious Counſels herein) will advance his Preſence in thee, whereby thou mayeſt have as much of his aſsiſtance as thy heart can deſire; Together with ſome Rules laid down whereby to judge whether a mans ſelf, or others, be filled with the Spirit, or with ſome other Spirit which only pretends to be the Spirit of God, but is not, but a Spirit of Error, and Deluſion; very uſeful at all times, but more eſpecially now, when Sathan that lying Spirit is playing his Laſt Game upon the World: his time being very ſhort he is put upon it more than ever to mingle his ſpiritual wickedneſſes with heavenly things, which are his moſt dangerous Weapons, and thereby doth greater execution than Men (generally) are aware of. There are many Wiles and ſubtil Devices by which Men are taken off from attending upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Goſpel, which is called the Ministry of the Spirit (which are very miſchievous and deſtructive it is to be feared to many, and endangering more) that are here detected, and their nakedneſs laid open: As alſo the great buſineſs of the Saints Communion with God both

In all which there are many Scriptures clearly opened. We question not but that perſons who have the uſe and exerciſe of their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Senſes, and are to any conſiderable degree able to diſcern things that differ, will find their precious time well ſpent in the reading hereof, and will find the diſcourſe pleaſant to their Spiritual Palate, and receive nouriſhment thereby in their inner man.</p>

            <p>Though I confeſs my ſelf not to be of the ſame mind and opinion with the Learned Author in ſome other controverted Points, yet I cannot but give my Teſtimony concerning this Peece, That I find an excellent Spirit moving on the face, and acting in the heart of it, to promote the Glory of God, the Power of Godlineſs, and conſequently the good of men, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Chriſtian men.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly an Expreſſion here and there may (as all Humane Writings do) call for a grain of Salt, as we uſe to phraſe it; but as to the tenour of the whole and the tendency thereof I do judge it to be very inoffenſive, and not a little, but very
<pb facs="tcp:95016:7"/>uſeful. The Author ('tis true) according to his wonted Genius doth often traverſe a great deal of ground, and fetcheth ſome compaſſes before he come to his deſigned jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys-end; yet he makes it pleaſant too by ſuch variety, and will thereby pay the Reader for his pains and patience, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of him. The Epiſtle of the Publiſhers, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Book will give ſo clear and full an account of the whole, that I ſhall need to ſay no more concerning it. That this and all good Books may be well read and improved is the hearty Wiſh and Prayer of him, who is a lover of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yea, and of all men</p>

Several Scriptures opened and argued (both from the Old and New Teſtament) proving that the Spirit, ſpoken of in the Text, is none other than <hi>Johovah,</hi> or the moſt High God, The ſeveral Pleas brought againſt theſe
<pb facs="tcp:95016:9"/>Scriptures, by perſons contrary minded, taken off, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered invalid. As alſo ſome Grounds in Reaſon propounded and argued to prove that the Holy Ghoſt is very God. <hi>Page 142</hi>

Secondly, An account given what ſtrangers the Saints themſelves are unto many great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and more eſpecially unto this great Duty of being filled with the Spirit, inſomuch that even this Generation are (as it were) aſleep thereunto. Thirdly, That this great bleſſedneſs of being filled with the Spirit is no impoſſible thing but is attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the endeavours and engagements of men. Fourthly, and laſtly, That it is the Will and Deſign of God that Believers ſhould be a Royal Generation of Kings and Prieſts unto himſelf, and that they ſhould live accordingly. <hi>p. 345</hi>

A firſt ſort are ſuch who ſcoff at ſuch a thing as a being filled with the Spirit of God. A ſecond ſort of Offenders are ſuch who perſwade men that the Spirit, which they are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:95016:10"/>to be filled with, is but a finite Spirit, an Angel, and not God. Wherein many things are further argued, proving the Holy Ghoſt to be the moſt High God. <hi>Page 358</hi>

Wherein the ſeveral Scriptures and Reaſons by which they ſtrengthen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in their evil way, are examined, and found bent againſt them. And likewiſe the neceſſity of the Miniſtry of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the great benefit thereof largely aſſerted, and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. <hi>Page 387</hi>

                  <label>CHAP. XV.</label> Five ſorts of Offenders more under the Second Head reproved: Firſt, Such who are chill and cool in their reſpects unto the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. An account of the Cauſes thereof: The danger of falſe Notions concerning God. A ſecond ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for withdrawing from a lively and powerful Miniſtry: Reaſons of ſuch miſcarriages. Legal and Evangelical Miniſtry diſtinguiſhed. What renders Perſons duly fitted for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Goſpel. The third ſort, justly reprovable, are ſuch who neglect to be led by the Spirit of God. How, and when the Spirit of God is neglected, A fourth ſort juſtly reprovable alſo are ſuch that do reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt or Spirit of God. The fifth and laſt ſort of Offenders are ſuch who refuſe to ſow unto the Spirit of God. <hi>Page 419</hi>

                  <label>CHAP. XVI.</label> The fourth (and laſt) <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Doctrine being an Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to uſe all means we are capable of in order to a being filled with the Spirit of God. Three Motives propounded:
<pb facs="tcp:95016:11"/>The firſt, More generally taken from the nature of the Commandments of God. That this Duty is one of the holy and righteous Retinue of Duties enjoyned us by God. Neglect of his Commands provoketh him to Jealouſie. The ſecond Motive. This being known to be a Duty enjoyned by God, neglected, hinders the Soul from proſpering in the things of its own peace. The vaſt difference and great danger of an habitual Omiſſion of known Duties in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of Duties a man is ignorant of. A third Motive. This is a Duty enjoyned by the Lord Chriſt, who ſpeaks now from Heaven. The difference between God's ſpeaking on the Earth, and now ſpeaking from Heaven. Neglect of Evangelical Duties much more provoking than the neglect under the Law. <hi>Heb. 12.25.</hi> in part opened. A being filled with the Spirit purely Evangelical. <hi>Page 452</hi>
               </item>
               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. XVII.</label> Four Conſiderations more to enforce the Exhortation. The fourth Motive: the great benefit accruing unto men and women by a ſerious engagement in a courſe likely to iſſue in a being filled with the Spirit. It will free men and women from fooliſh, unclean, and noyſome luſts, ſomewhat peculiar in this engagement differing from others, though worthy in their kind. A fifth Motive, proving that in caſe men do what God hath and doth enable them to do in order to a being filled with the Spirit of God, this their enterprize ſhall aſſuredly proſper in their hand. Hope of obtaining great encouragement unto Endeavours. Some more of the great Priviledges that accompany a being filled with the Spirit. A ſixth Motive, That the Reaſons and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of men are not capable of being employed upon terms of greater benefit and advantage than in this engagement. A ſeventh Conſideration, taken from the uncertainty of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things of this World by all the means that can be uſed, and alſo from the uncertainty of the continuance of theſe things, if gotten: Whereas a being filled with the Spirit, as it is attainable, ſo by a perſeverance in the uſe
<pb facs="tcp:95016:11"/>of means our attainments in this kind ſhall ſtand by us for ever. <hi>Page 463</hi>

               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. XVIII.</label> The Eighth (and laſt) Motive: That a being filled with the Spirit will render the Condition of men and women moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable in this World, and in that which is to come. That no other courſe will do it but this, or none without this. Four things, a concurrence whereof will render a man's Condition in this life moſt deſirable. <hi>1.</hi> A freedom from all troubleſome, diſtracting, and tormenting fears and cares. <hi>2.</hi> A heart and conſcience abounding in Joy and Peace. <hi>3.</hi> A large and free Communion with God. <hi>4.</hi> And laſtly, A rich and large inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God to be able to carry great Matters in Prayer with him. Three of theſe inſiſted on: <hi>1.</hi> A being filled with the Spirit will diſcharge men from all troubleſome and diſtracting fears and cares. <hi>2.</hi> The Peace and Joy of men will abound by a being filled with the Spirit. <hi>3.</hi> A third particular which renders mens Condition ſo deſirable in the World is a free and large Communion with God. <hi>1.</hi> What is meant by Communion with God. <hi>2.</hi> What by a free Communion. <hi>3.</hi> What is meant by a large and full Communion with God. <hi>4.</hi> How this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion renders man's Condition very deſirable in the World. <hi>5.</hi> That this Priviledge muſt needs accompany a being filled with the Spirit. What it is for God to dwell or abide in man. How a man may know that God dwelleth in him by the Spirit which is given him. How perfect love caſteth out fear. In what reſpect the Spirit may be ſaid to witneſs with our ſpirits that we are the Children of God. A well-grounded Confidence. The Cauſes of a falſe Confidence enquired into. A good Conſcience a ground of Aſſurance. <hi>Page 482</hi>

                  <label>CHAP. XIX.</label> The Eighth Motive further opened in the fourth particular, a being filled with the Spirit doth intereſt men with a rich and large Intereſt in God. How this Intereſt doth ariſe by being
<pb facs="tcp:95016:12"/>filled with the Spirit of God. Reaſons why ſo little is done by Prayer now, in compariſon of what was done in the Primitive times. Without being filled with the Spirit none of the great bleſſings, formerly mentioned (and which render a mans Condition ſo deſirable in this World) are to be obtained. The Reaſons whence it comes to paſs: And the equitableneſs of God's proceeding with men therein. The difference between a fearleſs and dreadleſs frame of ſpirit, that is counterfeit, and that which is raiſed upon good Grounds. A being filled with the Spirit is the only way to cauſe the Crown of glory to flouriſh on the head of a man; And that with a greater meaſure of glory in the World which is to come. <hi>Page 522</hi>

                  <hi>And be not drunk with Wine, wherein is exceſs: but be filled with the Spirit.</hi> The Apoſtle having in the former part of this Epiſtle (as his uſual method was) declared and laid down foundation-wiſe, that great Doctrine of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> namely juſtification by [or through] faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> In the latter part thereof, he builds upon this foundation Precepts and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, to ſuch duties and behaviours, which may very juſtly and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably be expected, upon the account of ſuch rich grace, from God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed unto ſinful men, in their free juſtification by Chriſt. Now in Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Exhortations unto Chriſtian duties, there is not alwaies a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence or relation of coherence, between duty and duty, or between that which goeth before, and that which followeth after: But Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are many times like unto <hi>Solomons Proverbs,</hi> which reſemble Jewels or precious ſtones, not ſet together in order, or in any form of ſpecial aſpect, one upon another, but as it were laid together in great heaps: Yet there is (I confeſs) a relative oppoſition, between the words read, and the former part of the verſe plainly intimated by this adverſative Particle <hi>But: And be not drunk with wine, wherein is exceſs: But be filled
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95016:13"/>with the Spirit.</hi> Which Particle clearly implies, that to be drunken with wine, (as we have it) or, as the word (elſewhere) frequently ſignifieth, To drink wine freely, or to be given inordinately unto it, to ſit upon the brink of the pit of drunkenneſs, though (poſſibly) you may not fall into it; Is a thing inconſiſtent with your being filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For wine being freely drank, as it inflames a man, or the body of a man: So on the contrary it quencheth the Spirit in him, and cauſeth that to abate its fervency by degrees, and to withdraw more and more from the Soul; or elſe obſtructeth his entrance into a man. For the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſenſe and meaning of the words there are three things briefly to be opened.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> What is here meant by the Spirit. Secondly, What it is to be filled with the Spirit. Thirdly, why the Apoſtle exhorts and perſwades, to a being filled, or to a filling of themſelves, with the Spirit, by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the preceding dehortation, <hi>viz.</hi> from being drunken with, or from being given to much wine.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, There are ſeveral ſignifications of the word Spirit, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which yet it is as clear as the Sun, that the Apoſtle hath nothing to do with in this place. 1. It ſometimes ſignifieth the wind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. 2. Sometimes it ſignifieth courage, or ſuch a frame of heart which is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to deſpondency, or extremity of fear, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Neither was there Spirit in them any more.</hi> 3. It ſometimes ſignifieth the mind, diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or inclination of a man, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.29. <hi>But he that is haſty</hi> [or rather according to the original, ſhort,] <hi>of Spirit. i. e.</hi> that is of a Cholerick, or raſh temper, or diſpoſition, being not able to contain himſelf, or hold out in patience, for a little ſeaſon under temptations, <hi>exalteth folly.</hi> 4. It ſometimes ſignifieth the ſoul of a man; and this is a frequent accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this word in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> I need not cite any inſtances for this, places of this import are obvious and frequent. Sometimes the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or diſcerning powers, or faculties of the ſoul are ſignified thereby.<note place="margin">Exod. 35.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Every one whom his Spirit made willing; i. e.</hi> whoſe judgment and underſtanding in artificial work inclined him to a willingneſs in that kind, <hi>viz.</hi> for the work of the Sanctuary. There are theſe, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other ſignifications of the word Spirit, which by comparing the place in hand with the particularities of them, it will be found as clear as the Sun at noon day, that they are none of them to be underſtood, or meant in this place: and therefore for expedition ſake I ſhall omit them; Neither ſhall I argue againſt any of thoſe ſeveral ſenſes, of the word Spirit even now mentioned.</p>
               <p>That by the Spirit, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> here is meant the holy, bleſſed, and incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Spirit of God, the third of the three Perſons in the <hi>divine Being,</hi> or <hi>Eſſence;</hi> Beſides the concurrent judgment of the beſt Expoſitors upon the place, It may be evinced from the Antitheſis, or oppoſition the words read have unto the former part of the verſe; As alſo from the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95016:13"/>comportance and perfect agreement in the next verſe, with this ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the word Spirit.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, the Apoſtle oppoſeth their being filled with the Spirit, to their being drunken, or filled with wine. Now take the word Spirit, in any other ſignification whatſoever, beſides that we have pitched upon, <hi>viz.</hi> for the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and you will not find any ſuch emphatical livelineſs, in oppoſition between being drunken with wine, and being filled with the <hi>Spirit:</hi> you may make trial, and take an account of particulars at your leiſure. But now between being drunk with wine, and being filled with the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit of God, there is ſuch a ſtrong clear and pregnant oppoſition, that the one fighteth againſt (and excludeth) the other; For he that is <hi>drunk with wine,</hi> is full of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of ſin, and of the devil; and during either the act or the habit, but eſpecially the act of ſuch a drunkenneſs, ſuch a perſon is utterly uncapable for that time <hi>in ſenſu compoſito,</hi> ſo long as he is under the power of his drunkenneſs, of being filled with the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> As on the contrary, he that is <hi>filled with the Spirit of God,</hi> is in no capacity, during this his fulneſs, of being made drunk with wine wherein is exceſs: But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, That by the Spirit, here is meant the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> is further evident from what the Apoſtle immediately ſubjoyns, in the next verſe: <hi>Speaking to your ſelves in Pſalms, and Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs, making Melody in your hearts unto the Lord.</hi> As men that are drunken or enflamed with wine are apt to ſpeak to themſelves, and to entertain one another, with light, vain, and unſavoury mirth, and Songs of carnal and ſinful jollity: In like manner, if ye <hi>be filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God,</hi> you will be apt, and able to ſpeak to your ſelves, and ſolace and delight your ſelves, and be in a ſteady poſture to teach, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh one another, with matters of a ſpiritual and heavenly import. So that God himſelf will take a holy contentment in your mirth, and rejoyce with you. Whereas the vain and ſinful mirth of the others, namely, of thoſe that are <hi>drunken with wine,</hi> is the hatred and abhorring of his ſoul. But now there is no <hi>filling with the Spirit</hi> in any other ſenſe of the word Spirit (that only excepted which is pleaded for) that is proper or likely to qualifie men or women for theſe ſpiritual exerciſes of an heavenly mirth: It is only a <hi>being filled with the Spirit of God</hi> that is like to act or work the heart and ſoul of a man into ſuch a poſture or frame of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al rejoycing. We might further confirm this expoſition, by taking into conſideration all thoſe inſtances in the Scriptures (which are many) where men are ſaid to be filled with the Holy Ghoſt; and by comparing them in their reſpective context with the Scripture in hand, we might ſhew that the Holy Ghoſt there, and the Spirit here, are one and the ſame, See <hi>Acts</hi> 2.4. c. 4.31. c. 9.17. c. 13.52. We read likewiſe of perſons full of the Holy Spirit, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 6.3, 5. c. 7.55. c. 11.24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thus you ſee what is meant by the Spirit.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:95016:14"/>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> What is it to be <hi>filled with the Spirit?</hi> Or, What is it that the Apoſtle means, or what is the nature or property of the duty he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of them, and which is impoſed upon them when he chargeth them to <hi>be filled with the Spirit,</hi> or, as in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>be ye filled,</hi> in, or with, or through the <hi>Spirit?</hi> For to be filled with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> or through the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is one and the ſame. Now, fulneſs or fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, in the Scripture Language, do not alwaies (indeed very ſeldom, if at all) ſignifie, an abſolute or exact fulneſs, or a filling up to the brim, (as we uſe to ſay) or as great a quantity or proportion of a thing as the ſubject or veſſel is any waies able to contain or receive; for, in this ſenſe, no man was ever filled with the Holy Ghoſt, except it was he that was more than a man, the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> himſelf, to whom God is ſaid to have <hi>given the Spirit,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>without meaſure,</hi> or not <hi>by meaſure, Joh.</hi> 3.34. But things or perſons, in Scripture Phraſe, are ſaid to be full or filled with a thing when they have a good, rich, and plentiful proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Thus <hi>Acts</hi> 9.36. <hi>Dorcas</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be full of good works</hi> when ſhe had done or performed many, and been fruitful in well doing. In this ſenſe of the word, the Heathen; of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.29. are ſaid <hi>to be filled with all unrighteousneſs;</hi> Not as if the meaning was, that they had as much wickedneſs as they were capable of, or as it was poſſible for them to be <hi>filled</hi> withall: But that there was a great degree of wickedneſs amongſt them, and ſome doubtleſs were more vile, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and abominable than others. But it is ſaid, that they were full; that is, There was abundance of unrighteouſneſs in them, or amongſt them. Beſides other like inſtances. So then, when the Apoſtle wills them to <hi>be filled with the Spirit,</hi> or <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> his meaning is, that he would have them have the Holy Ghoſt very actuous and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive within them; or more plainly, That he would have them take ſuch a courſe, go ſo to work, (as we uſe to ſay) and ſo behave themſelves, that the Holy Ghoſt might be very actuous, operative, and vigorous, and put forth himſelf, or his power abundantly in them. Or if we ſhall urge the ſtrict litteral ſenſe, Then the meaning will be to this effect, <hi>Be ye filled with the Spirit;</hi> that is, Let the Spirit advance his preſence and power in you as far and to what degree and height himſelf pleaſeth: Do not diſtaſte, check, or grieve him in his way, by any neglect, or rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any of his motions, by any unworthineſs whatſoever; Do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him in his Progreſs, but comport with him in all his applications unto you; and do not think you have enough of him untill you be filled with him even to the brim, and the receptacles of your Souls will hold no more. This Expoſition ſuppoſeth that Chriſtians ſhould deſire and labour to obtain as much, or as great, and as rich a preſence of the Spirit of God as they are capable of, and as the heart, and ſoul, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man is able to bear. This ſenſe of the word may very well ſtand. And then his meaniag is not, as if the Apoſtle did impoſe a neceſſity
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95016:14"/>upon them to reach and attain unto ſuch a fulneſs as we ſpeak of, in the higheſt degree; but only, that they ſhould not content themſelves with, or pitch upon any degree inferiour unto, or beneath the higheſt enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spirit of God, they are capable of. As when a man bids his child to ſhoot at the Sun, he doth not intend, or imagine that his child ſhould hit the Sun; His meaning is, that he would have him put forth his ſtrength in ſhooting as high as he is able: So when the Apoſtle layeth and impoſeth this upon the <hi>Epheſians</hi> by way of duty, that they ſhould <hi>be filled with the Spirit,</hi> his meaning is; That they ſhould behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with all wiſdom and underſtanding in the uſe of all means, within the reach of their own arm, as if their deſign and reſolution was to <hi>be filled with the Spirit</hi> as full as poſſibly they could.</p>
               <p>If it be demanded by way of Objection: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> But is the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the power of men? Or can men do any thing to fill themſelves with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi> Is he obnoxious unto men, or within the compaſs of their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and endeavours? Have men any thing in their hands to do, whereby, or by the means whereof, they may fill themſelves with the <hi>Spirit of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſhall hereafter have occaſion fully to anſwer to this queſtion; only by the way, (reſerving that till God ſhall give opportunity) for men to do ſuch and ſuch things, upon the doing whereof they ſhall have the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> more operative and active, more intenſive, and more raiſed in their hearts and ſouls: I ſay, If the Apoſtle maketh the doing of ſuch things a means whereby they may <hi>be filled with the Spirit,</hi> and cauſe him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them; and withal ſuppoſeth men to be capable of doing ſuch things, or uſing ſuch means whereby this bleſſed end may be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; As it is evident he doth by the Exhortations and Injunctions which he layeth upon them: Then men in this ſenſe may be truly ſaid to be capable of <hi>filling themſelves,</hi> or of being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> when they ſhall be faithful in the uſe of ſuch means, which will certainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this moſt deſirable effect. Yet doth it not follow from hence, or from what hath been ſpoken, That the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is ſubject unto men, or that men have any power (to ſpeak properly) over him, or that he is any way obnoxious unto them. This indeed follows from what hath been ſpoken, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath graciouſly ſubjected himſelf unto his own Laws, and Rules, and Will in this caſe; and hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make ſuch gracious promiſes unto men, that if they will go along with him, and follow his leading and ducture, they ſhall have as much of his preſence and company as their hearts can deſire.

So then, the Premiſes conſidered, the reaſon why men by doing thus, <hi>ſhall be filled with the Spirit,</hi> is not ſimply or meerly becauſe men do ſuch and ſuch things; or as if there were any thing conſiderable in what men do in order to their being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> as if there were any thing either of merit or deſert in them; No nor yet, as if there were any thing in what men do, in a natural way, able or tending to produce ſuch an effect as the being <hi>filled with the Spirit:</hi> But the reaſon of this Connexion and Conjunction of theſe two things; namely, that upon the uſe of ſuch means, as we ſpeak of, this great effect ſhall be produced, or end attained unto, <hi>viz.</hi> a being <hi>filled with the Spirit:</hi> The reaſon (I ſay) of this Connexion, is, <hi>the eternall Counſel, the gracious Law and Decree of God, and ſo of the Spirit of God himſelf:</hi> He having ſet it down, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it, and accordingly revealed it, That thus it ſhall be; ſo that the effect of <hi>being filled</hi> with the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> is not the reſult of the means: but the proper product of that Eternal Law and Decree which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath made. For otherwiſe, if we ſhall ſuppoſe that there were no ſuch Law or Decree of God in being; if men ſhould uſe never ſo much means, do the ſame things a thouſand times over, it would never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; ſo that the reaſon why men come <hi>to be filled with the Spirit of God</hi> upon the uſing ſuch and ſuch means, is not becauſe of the means: but it ariſeth from the mighty force, and irreſiſtible power of the Decree of God; this is that which triumpheth over all the uſe of means. The Decrees of God are ſo full of grace and bounty, that they do not ſtand to meaſure inches (as we uſe to ſpeak) in the things of men, ſo, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they find ſo much worth or goodneſs in them, they ſhall never paſs with God, neither the performers of them be made partakers of any rich anoynting from him. No: This is not the tenour of the Decrees of God in general, nor of that of which we are ſpeaking particularly; but it hath a more favourable aſpect upon his Creature man, and importeth ſuch a thing as this. I know the nature of my Creatures, Men, and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the utmoſt of what they are able to do, their weakneſſes and frailties being conſidered; Yet let them but do what they can, let them ſhew their willingneſs to comply with me, and they ſhall have as much aſſiſtance from me, and from my Spirit, to help them on in this bleſſed deſign, of <hi>being filled with my Spirit,</hi> as their hearts can deſire. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is one of the higheſt and greateſt vouchſafements of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the children of men, that he hath opened unto them ſuch an effectual door or way whereby they may <hi>fill themſelves, or be filled with the Spirit;</hi> All other means which God by his providence hath vouchſafed unto men, of another nature, as to make them great, rich, honourable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> amongſt them all, there is none greater; Nay, none ſo great, and of ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95016:17"/>ſacred an import unto them, as this which we are ſpeaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> That God hath ſhewed them a way, and vouchſafed unto them means to <hi>be filled with the Spirit;</hi> which hath this bleſſed tendency in it, to raiſe them to the higheſt pitch they are capable of in the love and favour of God. When men are filled with the Spirit, they are no more like unto other men; <hi>They are more excellent than their neighbours:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 12.26.</note> For by this means (as we ſhall hereafter ſhew more at large) they ſhall be enabled to act <hi>in a peculiar Sphere by themſelves,</hi> leaving the world, yea, and the <hi>Saints</hi> themſelves, who have but a little or ſmall proportion of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to move in a lower and more inferiour Region; Whereas they ſhall mount up on high, and be carried (as it were) on Eagles wings, enabled to do worthily: Great and excellent things ſhall put forth themſelves in them, things that ſhall have more of heaven, more of glory, more of beauty, more matter for admiration, than can be found in, or raiſed from the ſtirrings, movings, and doings in the world round about them. So that by this you may eaſily judge, of what a bleſſed conſequence it is unto men <hi>to be filled with the Spirit of God.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. The third and laſt particular, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> propoſed for the opening of the words, was to ſhew why the Apoſtle ſubjoyns this poſitive Exhortation or Precept, concerning their being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> by way of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis or oppoſition to the negative dehortation <hi>not to be drunken with wine.</hi> I anſwer, this ſeems to be the reaſon thereof; becauſe that which invites men to drunkenneſs is a certain kind of jollity, lightneſs, or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit that <hi>is occaſioned by the drinking of wine,</hi> according to the judgments of many who write concerning the tempers of men, who ſay, that there is a kind of lightneſs and frenzineſs of Spirit, which is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the drinking wine, wherein ſome men take more content and ſatisfaction than they do in any other thing. And therefore the Holy Ghoſt doth direct them to ſuch a courſe wherein they ſhall have far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contentments, not (indeed) of the ſame kind, or flowing from the ſame cauſe: but however they ſhall be ſatisfied in that which they ſo much deſire; they ſhall have jollity, lightneſs, and chearfulneſs of Spirit indeed of a far better nature, and upon far better and more excellent terms than what they could expect from their <hi>being filled or drunken with wine.</hi> That jollity or mirth of ſpirit which men pleaſe and ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in, when they are under the influence of wine, is but melancholy, and dull or dead, in compariſon of that mirth and rejoycing, that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs of mind and ſpirit which they ſhall certainly attain unto, and be made partakers of, if they would but take the ſame courſe <hi>to be filled with the Spirit</hi> which they do <hi>to be filled with Wine.</hi> So that this is the reaſon (as I conceive) why the Apoſtle ſubjoyns this affirmative Precept unto the negative Dehortation.</p>
               <p>The Doctrines, which we ſhall raiſe from the words thus opened, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> are only theſe four: Firſt, from the adverſative Particle <hi>[But]</hi> which (as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95016:18"/>hath been ſaid) notes an oppoſition between the latter part of the verſe and the former. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine </seg>1</label> This <hi>Doctrine</hi> ſpringeth forth, <hi>viz. That drunkenneſs with Wine, or inordinate drinking, is altogether inconſiſtent with a being filled with the Spirit.</hi> Or if you will, we may phraſe it thus: <hi>That inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinateneſs in drinking is inconſiſtent with a filling with the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, From the Phraſe here uſed, <hi>Be ye filled with the Spirit;</hi> The Apoſtle's meaning only being (as was ſhewed) that he would have them uſe the means, take ſuch a courſe that they might <hi>be filled with the Spirit;</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>2</label> The <hi>Doctrine</hi> is: <hi>That in matters of Religion, and things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining unto Salvation, to uſe the means, and to obtain the end, are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively and in effect one and the ſame.</hi> Or thus: <hi>That in ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, a regular uſe of means, and the obtaining the end, are by the Counſel and Decree of God inſeperably joyned together.</hi> The Apoſtle had in vain exhorted the <hi>Epheſians to be filled with the Spirit,</hi> if having uſed the beſt means they were able thus <hi>to be filled,</hi> they might notwithſtanding remain empty. The Counſels and Exhortations of God in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> are not like unto a Lottery, into which a man may caſt his money, and yet be far enough from drawing a Prize.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>3</label> Whereas the Apoſtle layeth it upon them by way of duty <hi>to be filled with the Spirit,</hi> this Doctrine ariſeth: <hi>That neither men, nor women, can expect (I mean upon any ſufficient, yea, or tolerable grounds) te be filled with the Spirit of God, but by the uſe of ſuch means as are proper and appointed by God thereunto.</hi> If the <hi>Epheſians</hi> had had any reaſon or ground to have expected this bleſſed accommodation here ſpoken of <hi>(viz. a being filled with the Spirit of God)</hi> without their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for the obtaining of it, it had been impertinent and needleſs for him to have impoſed it upon them by way of duty.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, (and laſtly) From the plain, expreſs, and full import of the Precept or Exhortation we may obſerve: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>4</label> 
                  <hi>That it is the duty of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (eſpecially of all the Profeſſors of the Goſpel, or of Chriſtianity) to be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, or ſpirit of God.</hi> This being the Point that lieth moſt clear and large in the words read: Contenting our ſelves with the bare mentioning the other three (unleſs ſomething relating unto them ſhall occaſionally fall in; in our intended diſcourſe) we ſhall proceed only with it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> for the truth of the <hi>Doctrine;</hi> had we no other proofs for it from the <hi>Scriptures</hi> but the Text in hand, this alone by reaſon of the evidence and expreſsneſs of it were ſufficient to carry it: But there are other <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> alſo, which being well underſtood, and throughly ſearched into, ſpeak and import the ſame thing; as <hi>(viz.)</hi> that it is matter of duty lying upon all men (eſpecially thoſe who do profeſs Chriſtianity) <hi>to be filled with the Spirit, Jude v.</hi> 19. <hi>Senſual, not having the Spirit</hi> [namely, of God] as is clear from the Character he gives of the perſons here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, unto the Chriſtians that he writeth unto: For, what ſhould be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95016:18"/>the reaſon, why the Apoſtle taketh this notice of them? Namely, that, whereas they ſeparated themſelves from the Congregation of the <hi>Saints,</hi> yet were they <hi>ſenſual, not having the Spirit;</hi> who though they did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to a greater degree of light, and more familiarity and acquaintance with the Spirit of God than other Chriſtians did; yet the Apoſtle tells thoſe Chriſtians to whom he wrote that they ſhould not believe them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were <hi>ſenſual,</hi> only talking and boaſting of the Spirit; which conceit, and confident preſumption in them, of their <hi>having the Spirit,</hi> was the ground or occaſion of their ſeparation and dividing from the Aſſemblies of other Chriſtians: But the truth is (ſaith our Apoſtle) they <hi>are ſenſual, not having the Spirit:</hi> Nay, they take a courſe not to have the Spirit, which is by their giving themſelves up to ſenſuality. They (indeed) pretend to the Spirit, that ſo they might the better ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie themſelves and others concerning the liberty which they take in the waies of the fleſh, ſuch as other Chriſtians did not take; bearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and others in hand that they had the warrant for their practice by ſpecial <hi>revelation:</hi> And they underſtood their liberty better than other Chriſtians: and that they came to this priviledge by the <hi>ſuper-Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical</hi> Communion which they had with the Spirit of God; And yet notwithſtanding all theſe pretences the Apoſtle poſitively concludes, that theſe men had not the Spirit; clearly implying withal, that this was their ſin not to have him; yea, and futther, that their not having of him, did intereſs them in the guilt of many other ſins. That it was ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in theſe (and is ſo in all others) <hi>not to have the Spirit,</hi> is evident from hence; becauſe they might have had and enjoyed him, would they but have complied with God in the uſe of ſuch means as he had vouchſafed unto them for that end. And that it was nothing but ſin and iniquity committed by them that kept <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> from them; this may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the teſtimony of God himſelf by his Prophet, <hi>Your iniquities have turned away theſe things, and your ſins have withholden good things from you Jer.</hi> 5.25. And that the Spirit of God is withheld from none, but only from thoſe that do refuſe or neglect to ask him of God by prayer, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more than affirmed by Chriſt in this high aſſertive Interrogation: <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: How much more ſhall your Father which is in heaven give the Holy Spirit to them that aske him? Luke</hi> 11.13. So alſo <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.38, 39. and <hi>Acts</hi> 5.32. <hi>God is ſaid to give the Holy Ghoſt to them that obey him.</hi> So that it was unqueſtionably ſinful in theſe ſenſual Separatiſts in <hi>Jude,</hi> that they had <hi>not the Spirit.</hi> Now then, if this was matter of ſin in them, <hi>not to have the Spirit:</hi> It clearly follows, that it was their duty, and a thing that they ought to have ſought after, to poſſeſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt themſelves with him. And if it were a matter of duty, incumbent upon them ſimply to have the Spirit, to have him in any meaſure or degree; then it followeth, by a ſtreight line in reaſon, or by a neceſſary
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95016:19"/>conſequence, That it was matter of duty alſo unto them, to have him in the greateſt meaſure, and in the higheſt degree or proportion that they were capable of attaining unto. For this is clear in reaſon, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is our duty ſimply to do, if the duty, or the doing of it, will admit of degrees, that it may be done more or loſs perfectly, (which is the condition of moſt duties, if not of all:) then it is our duty to do it in the higheſt degree, and with the greateſt perfection. If it be our duty to love God (ſimply) then certainly, to love him to a greater degree, yea, to the greateſt degree of all, is our duty alſo; namely, to love him with all our <hi>hearts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark 12.30.</note> 
                  <hi>ſouls, mind, and ſtrength.</hi> So likewiſe, if it be our duty to love our neighbour: Then is it our duty alſo, to love him <hi>with a pure heart, fervently,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. which is the higheſt pitch or degree of this affection. The caſe is the ſame in all other duties whatſoever, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought to endeavour, and ſtir up our ſelves unto the moſt perfect manner of performance. A duty is more our duty, and nearer to the intent of the Precept, or Exhortation enjoyning it, when performed with much intenſneſs of mind and ſpirit, and when it drinketh up much of the heart and ſoul of him that performeth it, and conſequently more acceptable unto God than when it is only ſimply, barely, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorily performed. So that this Scripture doth prove plainly enough the truth of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> in hand: <hi>viz. That it is the duty of all Chriſtians to be filled with the Spirit:</hi> And if any man do fail of this grace of God, and become ſenſual, it is becauſe he doth not comport with the Spirit in his motions and applications of himſelf unto him; for by this means the Spirit withdraweth his former influences from ſuch a perſon, and afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him but a faint and ſcanty preſence of himſelf afterwards.</p>
               <p>Again, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> from the Apoſtles Exhortation, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Quench not the Spirit,</hi> the truth of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> may be further argued, even to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration; For if it be a duty lying upon Chriſtians <hi>not to quench the Spirit: i. e.</hi> Not to do any thing that may juſtly occaſion him to ceaſe from his wonted activity within them, ſtirring their hearts, and cauſing them to burn with inflamed deſires after God and Jeſus Chriſt, and the things of their eternal peace; I ſay, If it be a duty to take heed of <hi>quenching the Spirit</hi> in ſuch a way as this: Then muſt it needs be a duty lying upon them <hi>to be filled with the Spirit,</hi> the fulneſs of whoſe preſence (as was formerly more than hinted) will cauſe their hearts to burn within them, and (as it were) to mount up unto heaven in a flame. It is an approved Rule, frequently made uſe of by learned Miniſters, for the right underſtanding of the <hi>Decalogue</hi> or <hi>Moral Law:</hi> That every Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative <hi>Commandment</hi> includeth the Affirmative contrary unto it: As that which forbiddeth the deſtroying, or the taking away the life of a man, enjoyneth withal the preſervation of his life with all tenderneſs and care. There is another Rule, delivered by ſome worthy Expoſitors of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, very neceſſary to acquaint us with the emphatical import of ſome
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95016:19"/>expreſſions here. The Rule is to this effect: Adverbs of denying do very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently import the contrary unto that word unto which they are joyned. Many inſtances of this Rule might readily be given, but this may be done upon ſome other occaſion: only for the preſent take notice, that this Scripture agreeth to that which is imported in both theſe Rules. This Negative dehortation, <hi>Quench not the Spirit,</hi> carrieth in it ſome ſuch Affirmative and commanding Precept as this: See that you be prudently induſtrious, and careful, with all diligence, to nouriſh and advance the life and vigour of the Spirit of God within you; entertain him with all worthy and honourable reſpects in your ſouls, let him have all the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that he deſireth or requireth of you: By this means you ſhall be ſo far from quenching him in his motions and operations, that he will burn like a bright flame of heavenly fire within you, and work won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully in your ſouls. That ſome ſuch ſenſe as this was intended by the Apoſtle, in the ſaid Dehortation, is not obſcurely intimated by that nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Precept, <hi>not to deſpiſe Prophecying,</hi> immediately ſubjoyned unto that, of <hi>not quenching the Spirit;</hi> (eſpecially) if it be interpreted by one, or both the Rules given for the interpretation of the former paſſage. For then, <hi>Not to deſpiſe Prophecying</hi> will ſignifie, to put an high eſteem upon <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying;</hi> (that is, in the Miniſtry or Preaching of the Goſpel:) which is done, partly, by a conſtant or frequent attendance upon it; as with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and fear; ſo with a lively and ſteady expectation of meeting with God and much good in it; partly alſo, by a conſciencious ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all a mans waies, words, and works, unto the authority and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of it. Now <hi>not to deſpiſe</hi> [that is, to honour] <hi>Prophecying,</hi> upon ſuch terms as theſe, (and duly honoured it cannot be upon any other:) is a direct and pregnant courſe, to cauſe the Spirit to take pleaſure in us, and to be as fire in our breaſts and bones, not ſuffering us to be in the dark, concerning any ſuch ſpiritual things, which are neceſſary or meet for us to know; nor yet to be remiſs, negligent, or cold, as to waies and works that are truly honourable, and worthy our high calling. And what doth all this ſignifie, being interpreted, but <hi>to be filled with the Spirit?</hi> Nor is there any way more dangerous unto men, or more threatening the great evil and miſery of being emptied of the Spirit, than <hi>to deſpiſe Prophecying,</hi> or the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8.) And the Miniſters of it; The Miniſters not of the Letter; that is, Not ſo much of the words, matter, or contents of the Goſpel; but of the Spirit: Becauſe the Spirit of God, according to the counſel and good pleaſure of God, in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, is wont to joyn himſelf, with the glorious truths of the Goſpel, publiſhed and proclaimed by his Meſſengers, when he hath an intent or deſire to go forth into the world, and to viſit the hearts and conſciences of the Sons and Daughters of men. See upon this account <hi>Acts</hi> 10.44. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2, 5. And as the Spirit (ordinarily) cometh unto the ſouls of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95016:20"/>men in a golden ſhower of <hi>Evangelical truths,</hi> rained down upon them from the mouth of a <hi>Church Angel:</hi> So doth he not only continue, but increaſe and inlarge his preſence in them, proportionably to that honour and obedience which is given by them unto thoſe truths by which he was brought into their ſouls. Therefore as the <hi>deſpiſing of Prophecying,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by undervaluing or neglecting the Ordinance, or diſpenſation of it; or whether it be by diſobeying, and caſting behind their backs the holy Counſels, and divine Injunctions of it, is a ready way <hi>to quench the Spirit:</hi> So on the contrary, to have this heavenly Ordinance in high eſteem, and with conſtancy in attending upon it, to joyn a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential and awful ſubjection unto the voice of it in our lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, is a method or means ſealed by God whereby to obtain that ineſtimable treaſure of being <hi>filled with the Spirit.</hi> Thus you ſee how the Apoſtles charge <hi>of not quenching the Spirit</hi> leadeth us directly, and by a clear light to the acknowledgment of this: <hi>That it is every mans duty to be filled with the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That other Dehortation of the ſame Apoſtle, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> (Parallel in Expreſſion, and partly in ſenſe, unto the former) <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God,</hi> (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.30.) being rightly argued and ſearched into, will give us the light of the ſame truth at the bottom of it. But let us firſt conſider what it is to grieve the Spirit, and then we ſhall ſee by the light of the two rules, mentioned in the opening of the former proof, how it doth follow from hence, That it is the duty of Chriſtians <hi>to be filled with the Spirit.</hi> The Spirit here ſpoken of is neither the Spirit of Man nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, (as we ſhall have occaſion to ſhew hereafter) <hi>but the eternal Spirit of God, the third Perſon in the Trinity.</hi> Now to ſpeak properly, this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is not ſubject unto grief, nor any other Paſſion whatſoever: But men are ſaid <hi>to grieve the Spirit,</hi> when they cauſe him to do, and act towards them that which men are uſed to do under the Paſſion of grief. Now you know that men, whilſt they are under the guidance of that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are liſtleſs, and indiſpoſed unto action; Grief contracts and ſtraightens; it is of a waſting and conſuming nature unto the heart and ſpirit, (<hi>Pſal,</hi> 31.9, 10.) It makes men heavy, lumpiſh, and ſad, averſe unto all action, as if they had neither life nor ſoul, (as we uſe to ſay) being like unto <hi>Davids</hi> Images, <hi>That have hands, and handle not; feet, and walk not,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 115.7. <hi>And</hi> Jobs <hi>three Friends</hi> (Job 2.13.) <hi>caſt themſelves down with him upon the ground, and for ſeven daies, and ſeven nights together none of them ſpeaking ſo much as a word unto him;</hi> the reaſon is given, <hi>becauſe they ſaw that his grief was very great:</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Junius</hi> well interprets it, That the greatneſs of that grief, which they perceived had taken hold of the ſpirit and ſoul of their Friend, ſo afflicted them, and becauſe that ſympathy &amp; commiſeration had wrought ſuch a grief in them, that they ſate all this while as perſons aſtoniſhed, and were not able to ſtir up themſelves to comfort him; by theſe inſtances
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95016:20"/>you may ſee it is the nature of grief to contract the heart, and to make men liſtleſs unto action. In like manner, the Spirit, through the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, diſobedient, and unworthy behaviour of men towards him, is ſaid <hi>to be grieved,</hi> when by ſuch means men have wrought him (if we may ſo ſpeak) to the like liſtleſsneſs of acting, and putting forth the excellencie of his power in their hearts and ſouls as formerly he did, and doth ſometime in others. On the other hand, a man is never in a right poſture for action, or for the doing of any thing that is of any good, or great concernment unto others, but when he enjoyeth himſelf upon the higheſt and richeſt terms of ſatisfaction and contentment: So then, the Spirit of God is ſaid <hi>to be grieved</hi> by men, when they ſhall deal ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly with or by him as to reject and neglect his heavenly motions, and inſpirations, by giving over ſuch and ſuch waies of honour, Chriſtian excellency and worth, which they had ſometime lift up their hearts and hands unto, and walked with delight in them: When men (I ſay) ſhall ceaſe to go on in ſuch waies as theſe, and prefer the ignoble and baſe motions of the Fleſh, or of the World, before thoſe that come from him, and which are all honourable, and heavenly, ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of men towards the Spirit of God grieveth him; that is, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him liſtleſs unto action, and cauſeth him to abate, and to fall lower in his operations, and to give out himſelf more faintly than before: Whereas he had been active, and ever and anon ſtirring, and provoking them, and this with efficacie and power unto this and that good way and work; now he withdraweth by degrees, and declineth theſe motions and operations, upon which the ſoul of man becomes liſtleſs, and dull to any thing of a ſpiritual concernment; like a Ship becalmed on the Seas, whoſe Sails a little before were filled with freſh and pleaſant gales of wind, carrying her amain to her deſired <hi>Port.</hi> Now then, if it be a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lying upon Chriſtians not <hi>to grieve the Spirit;</hi> Then by the authority of both the Rules (by which we found out the true ſenſe of our former proof, both of them being as proper and uſeful here) it is their duty alſo to chear and delight the Spirit; I mean, to keep themſelves in ſuch a frame or poſture both inwardly in heart and ſoul, and outwardly in life and converſation, that he may take delight in them. And if it be the duty of Chriſtians to be pleaſing unto, and compliant with the Spirit, ſimply, indefinitely, and in any degree; Then upon the grounds for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly argued and made good, it is more their duty to endeavour with their whole heart and ſoul to pleaſe him in the higheſt. Now, when he taketh delight and pleaſure in any man, in more than an ordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he will ſignifie not only his contentment in this kind, but even the meaſure and degree of it alſo, by a proportionable advancement of his gracious activity upon all occaſions. This is that we intend, and hold forth in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> from the Apoſtles expreſſion of <hi>being filled with the Spirit,</hi> which alſo by warrant of the ſame authority we affirm to be a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lying upon all Chriſtians.</p>

Neither will an ordinary preſence or aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God (himſelf) carry the heart of a man up unto any ſuch pitch of devotion: He that will have an ear to hearken to the voice of this Exhortation, of <hi>being fervent in ſpirit</hi> in the Service of the Lord, muſt find out a way how to engage, and how to comport with the Spirit of God, that he may vouchſafe unto him a meaſure of his preſence heaped up to make him capable of ſo great and worthy an undertaking. Yea, men (I ſuppoſe) cannot <hi>be fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in ſpirit</hi> in doing any thing which they call, or judge to be the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, although it be a Service of their own fanſie, or genius, or of ſome worſe deity, unleſs they be acted therein by a ſpirit more active than their own. So then, if it be a duty lying upon all Chriſtians <hi>to be fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord;</hi> then is it a duty that beareth with the ſame weight upon them <hi>to be filled with the Spirit:</hi> Inaſmuch as the performance of the former of theſe duties cannot ſtand but by the performance of the latter: ſo that from hence it is evident that it is a duty incumbent upon all <hi>Chriſtians to be filled with the Spirit.</hi> Beſides theſe Scriptures now argued, we might (if need were) increaſe their number for the proof of our <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by arguing in like manner all thoſe Scriptures which require ſuch things of men that cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by men without a <hi>being filled with the Spirit;</hi> ſuch paſſages of theſe (which are not a few) do clearly import, that it is a duty, yea, a duty of duties; ſuch a duty without the performance whereof great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of other duties will ſuffer, and never appear in their glory. Texts of this import are theſe, with their fellows, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.24. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.36.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> The firſt Reaſon of the Doctrine propounded and argued, <hi>viz,</hi> That it is the duty of all perſons (eſpecially of all the Profeſſors of the Goſpel, or Chriſtianity) to be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit of God; Becauſe if men be not filled, or in a way of being filled, with the Spirit of God, they will be filled with ſome evil Spirit one or other.</head>
               <p>IT is therefore the duty of all Chriſtians <hi>to be filled with the Spirit;</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> becauſe if they be not filled, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> or do not endeavour to be filled with the Spirit of God, they will certainly be filled with ſome one or other worſe Spirit, which will lead them aſide into the waies of ſin and vanity, and of darkneſs and death: And moſt certain it is the duty of all Chriſtians to do all things that are requiſite and neceſſary for the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo great an evil and miſery coming upon them as this, namely, <hi>of being filled with any ſpirit</hi> contrary to the Spirit of God; and ſpirit of ſin and wickedneſs whatſoever. That it is ſimply neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch a polution or defilement, ſo miſerable a ſtate and condition as this; is not (or at leaſt ought not to be) a queſtion unto any man, who minds but to any degree the things of his peace. Now that it is a duty lying upon all, <hi>&amp;c. to be filled with the Spirit</hi> is evident, if we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider; that there are many other Spirits abroad in the world, every one of which hath a direct antipathy to the holy Spirit of God. That which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh more particularly of <hi>Doctrines: Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits whether they are of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.1. may be ſaid of Spirits in general: For there are many Spirits walking up and down in the World, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19 3. a ſpirit of perverſeneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. a ſpirit of whoredom, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.12. a ſpirit of covetouſneſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. a ſpirit of ſlumber, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. a ſpirit of fear, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. Now when principles, or diſpoſitions in men, whether they be diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unto vertue and holineſs, or unto ſin and vice, are grown up unto any fulneſs, ſo that they put forth themſelves with force, and are vigorous and active in them; It is uſual in the Scripture language, dialect, or manner of ſpeaking, to expreſs ſuch or ſuch principles or diſpoſitions by the name of Spirit: As when love acteth vigorouſly in men, to expreſs it by the name of the ſpirit of love: So a meek and humble frame of heart, by a ſpirit of meekneſs: So on the other hand, a perverſe and froward ſpirit, by a ſpirit of perverſeneſs: an inordinate love of money, or inordinate coveting after riches, by a ſpirit of covetouſneſs. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label>
               </p>
               <p>Now the reaſon of this denomination to call covetouſneſs where it is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95016:22"/>ſtrong and raiſed in men, and when they favour ſtrongly of it, by the name of a ſpirit of covetouſneſs; and ſo, of fear, when it is active and vigorous in men, by a ſpirit of fear: There is the ſame conſideration to be had of love, meekneſs, holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe principles or diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they are active and vigorous, are as well denominated unto us by the name of ſpirit, as thoſe which are of a contrary nature and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The reaſon hereof, is, Firſt, to ſhew that when principles and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in men are raiſed to any great degree of ſtrength, and become vigorous and active, and have gotten any conſiderable power, in, or over men (if I may ſo ſpeak) they are hard to be reſiſted; Even as Spirits [or Angels] who, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, excell [or according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew reading in the Margin, are mighty] in ſtrength, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.20. they are yery potent and powerful, not eaſie to be reſiſted in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: Even ſo it is with principles, and diſpoſitions, when they are grown to any conſiderable height in men, and become ſtrong, and potent, they are hard to be reſiſted, and therefore called by the Holy Ghoſt by the name of Spirit. Or elſe happily the reaſon may be (which I chiefly eye) becauſe all diſpoſitions in men, and principles of action, whether good or evil, when ever they are raiſed any whit high, and have gotten ſtrength within them; there is ſome ſpirit or other, good, or evil, that mingleth it ſelf with them, and by this means doth add vigour and ſtrength unto them, and doth raiſe them above that meaſure and pitch of ſtrength and activity, which they would never be raiſed unto without the interpoſure of ſome ſuch Spirit, good or evil, properly ſo called. It is true, When holy diſpoſitions in men are in their greateſt ſtrength and glory, there is but one Spirit by which they are acted, and that is, <hi>the Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> who through the infiniteneſs of his power doth anſwer, yea, more than anwer, yea, even far ſurpaſs in power, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of unclean Spirits: and therefore when holy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and inclinations are raiſed in men, though they be many and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and ſpring from different principles in the heart and ſoul of a man; Yet this one and <hi>indiviſible ſpirit</hi> is able through, or by means of his concurrence with them, and influencing of them, to add ſtrength, power, and energie unto them, and enable every one of them to fructifie, and bring forth genuine fruit according unto its reſpective kind. But now as concerning evil and ſinful principles and diſpoſitions; it is very probable that the caſe is far otherwiſe: For as there is a vaſt number and company of devils and unclean ſpirits, ſo is it no waies diſſonant unto reaſon, to conceive that they have their diſtinct imployments and offices: One ſort of them may be employed to raiſe, ſtir up, and ſtrengthen a ſpirit of uncleanneſs in men: Another, a ſpirit of covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: A third, a ſpirit of malice and revenge: A fourth, a ſpirit of gluttony and exceſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 1.21. Col. 2.15. Mat. 12.25, 26.</note> Scripture, and that not obſcurely, ſeems to countenance this notion, (<hi>viz.</hi>) that they are ranged into orders, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95016:22"/>are under a kind of regiment, and that they are in a ſtraight band, league, and confederacy to carry on one and the ſame grand deſign. And if ſo, their nature conſidered (<hi>viz.</hi> their wiſdom and ſubtilty) it is moſt probable that every one of them is imployed according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per genius. Some, becauſe they are of a more bloudy and cruel nature than others, may be employed to ſtir up, and to ſtrengthen in men a ſpirit of malice and perſecution; Others, that are otherwaies diſpoſed, may be imployed to ſtir up, and cheriſh a ſpirit of pride and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; A third ſort of them, whoſe genius lyeth that way, to ſtrengthen and increaſe a ſpirit of error: But we may have occaſion to ſpeak more of this afterwards.</p>
               <p>In the mean ſeaſon this is that which we ſay in the reaſon in hand: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> That unleſs men ſhall take a courſe <hi>to be filled with the Spirit of God,</hi> they will by degrees, (at leaſt) and perhaps ſooner than they are aware, be filled with ſome evil and contrary ſpirit; a ſpirit of ſome ſin and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, one or other. The reaſon hereof is plain, and near at hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the evil and unclean Spirit, that is, the old <hi>Serpent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 1.7.</note> commonly called the Devil, who walketh up and down the world, compaſſing the earth too and fro (as his own expreſſion is) ſeeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> whom he may devour at once,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.8.</note> and with as much haſte as poſſible may be; meaning by filling them with all unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with uncleanneſs, love of this world, fearleſneſs of God, and of his Laws, Precepts, and Commands. For he (namely Satan) hath no other weapons to deſtroy men and women withal but theſe: And in theſe (and in theſe only) lye his murthering and devouring attempts. So that where he meets not with one that is greater, and ſtronger than himſelf to oppoſe him: And there is but one to ſtand in his way, of whom the <hi>Apoſtle John</hi> gives this teſtimony, <hi>That he that is in you</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>Saints</hi>) <hi>is greater than he that is in the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.4. I ſay, When he meets not, and is not encountred by this Spirit of God, that is ſtronger than he; Yea, if this Spirit have not advanced in his ſtrength and aſſiſtance (by the means before ſpoken of) to ſome good degree in the hearts and ſouls of men; He (namely, the evil one) is very likely to prevail, yea, and queſtionleſs will prevail over men, and fill the hearts and inward parts of men with all unrighteouſneſs, covetouſneſs, love of the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with all manner of ſinful inclinations, diſpoſitions, and propentions, which will be their ruine. <hi>For ſin</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> teſtifieth) <hi>when it is finiſhed bringeth forth death,</hi> Jam, 1.15. When it is finiſhed, <hi>i. e.</hi> impenitently perſiſted in, unto the laſt, it certainly bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth damnation, or eternal deſtruction upon men: Or if you will thus, Sin when it is finiſhed [or perfected,] that is, when it is raiſed, hath much of ſtrength and power in the heart and ſoul of a man, and when they are full of ſin: Then it is apt and likely to bring forth death; the workings and operations thereof incline, and tend ſtrongly that way, yea,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95016:23"/>and will certainly iſſue in Death (as was even now hinted) if it be not ſtopped in its way by a more than ordinary care and diligence to make reſiſtance againſt it. Now, that Satan or the evil Spirit will certainly prevail with men and women to fill themſelves with him, or with his fruits, unleſs <hi>they be filled,</hi> or in a way of <hi>filling</hi> themſelves with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is evident upon theſe two gradual conſiderations taken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> If men ſhall be found to be wholly deſtitute and devoid of the Spirit of God, and (as it were) altogether fleſh; ſo that they have not wherewith to oppoſe, or to make any reſiſtance againſt the devil, or evil Spirit in any kind, or (at leaſt) to any conſiderable degree: Then is it no marvel if he prevail over men. For that which is fleſh in men, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we take it for that which is properly ſo called, the body or outward man, conſidered (ſimply) as ſuch; or whether by fleſh we mean <hi>that which is born of the fleſh,</hi> according to our Saviours expreſſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>i.e.</hi> inordinate deſires, ſinful inclinations, and luſts that are ingendred and occaſioned by the fleſh: I ſay, in both theſe conſiderations, whether we take the fleſh either litterally, or metaphorically, it is wholly confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate with Satan againſt the ſoul and ſpiritual life of man, ready to open unto him, and comport with him in all his dangerous and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive applications of himſelf unto them: and conſequently, ſuch men, that are only fleſh, or full of it, receive the Laws of their minds from the inſpiration thereof, and are not furniſhed with any principles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to oppoſe him; and as it is ſaid concerning <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> That they that perſecuted him <hi>did unto him whatſoever they liſted:</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Mat. 17.12. Mar. 9.13.</note> Even ſo the Scriptures ſpeak of, or concerning ſuch perſons as we are now treating of; That <hi>Sathan carrieth them captive at his will,</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them with what kind of luſts and uncleanneſs he pleaſeth, yea, and to what degree he pleaſeth. When men are filled with the Holy Spirit, ſo that it acteth with much ſtrength and vigour in them, and that they are ſubdued and brought under the power thereof, the Scripture is uſed to ſpeak of them as wholly diabled and debilitated to ſin. So the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh concerning himſelf, (and of ſuch others that were made partakers of the ſame anointing with him:) <hi>For we can do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. So on the contrary, they that are filled with the ſpirit of the devil have nothing in them but what is born of the fleſh, and therefore they can do nothing for, but againſt the truth; no not in their own ſouls, judgments, and conſciences: ſtill comporting with Sathan againſt the truth, and their own peace and comfort. But</p>
               <p>It is a Queſtion (perhaps) of no eaſie reſolution; Whether there be any perſon, man or woman under heaven who is wholly deſtitute of the Spirit of God, unleſs it be thoſe which have blaſphemed the Spirit of God, and <hi>have ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone, which will certainly not only break,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95016:23"/>but grind all to powder which ſhall fall under it:</hi> That ſin which is the ſeed of immortal, eternal, and irreconcileable hatred and alienation between the Spirit of God and the Spirit of him whoſoever he be that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it: I mean the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. I rather (at preſent) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the affirmative part of the Queſtion, and do conceive, That there is no perſon of mankind, who from, or after his firſt enlightening by the Spirit of God, upon, and after his coming into the world, under the guilt of any ſin or ſins whatſoever (except that ſin only before excepted) that is, at any time untill the day and hour of his death, <hi>wholly bereaved of the preſence, and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God with him.</hi> Of which my apprehenſions I have (as I remember) heretofore given ſome account, and may (poſſibly) have occaſion to ſpeak more largely unto it hereafter. But for the preſent, Whereas <hi>ſome in the Scripture are ſaid not to have the Spirit. Jude</hi> the 19 verſe <hi>ſennſual, not having the Spirit</hi> (a Scripture for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made uſe of upon another occaſion.)</p>
               <p>I anſwer, the meaning is not, as if they had no degree or preſence, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> or no aſſiſtance of, or from the Spirit of God within them: But this, by <hi>not having the Spirit,</hi> is meant, That there was no appearance of the exerciſe of the Spirit, is meant, That there was no appearance of the exerciſe of the Spirit of God in them: They appeared unto the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, as ſuch who had not the Spirit; their lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations were ſuch which did not ſhew forth any preſence of the Spirit of God in them. A perſon, in the Scripture Phraſe, is ſaid not to have that which he doth not make uſe of, or improve, or that which he doth not ſeem to have; <hi>For unto every one that hath</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.29.) <hi>ſhall be given, and he ſhall have abundance: But from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath.</hi> By him that hath, (in the former clauſe) <hi>to whom more ſhall be given,</hi> muſt needs be meant a man that uſeth, or imployeth that which he hath, ſo, and upon ſuch terms, that he gives an account unto the world, makes it known unto men that he hath received ſome Talent, one or more from God: For otherwiſe if we ſhall take the word [hath] in a Grammatical, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe, it will follow, that every one ſhall have more given, and ſo every one ſhall have abundance. For all men have in ſuch a ſenſe of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. All men have ſomewhat from God originally: But now in as much as he (namely, who had the one Talent) is ſaid to have buried it in a napking, therefore our Saviour preſents him under this notion, and character of one that had not; becauſe he did not make uſe, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that which he had; took no courſe to make it appear unto men that he had any ſuch Talent, or means from God. So it is frequent, and ordinary in the Scripture, to expreſs one who uſeth not what he hath, and which giveth no teſtimony or account of what he hath, by the Phraſe of not having at all. In like manner, in the place under conſideration, where it is ſaid, that men of ſuch a Character have not the Spirit; The meaning is not, that they had not the Spirit at all, or in no degree:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95016:24"/>But only this that they being ſenſual, were chiefly guided, and that their waies and works were influenced, by the fleſh, and fleſhly principles: But as for <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> he was wholly neglected, neither did they take any courſe to improve his preſence in them, nor to give any account un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men by their lives and converſations of any preſence of his with them. This is one conſideration from whence (in conjunction with that which follows) it appears, that he that <hi>is not filled,</hi> or at leaſt in a way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>filled with the Spirit of God,</hi> is in eminent danger of <hi>being filled</hi> with an evil or contrary ſpirit. The conſideration (as you heard) was this, that whoſoever is deſtitute of the Spirit of God, or is wholly fleſh, (in the ſenſe declared) hath nothing wherewith to reſiſt the unclean ſpirit that ſhall ſeek to enter into him, and to fill him with his preſence, but all things which are confederate with him, and aſſiſt him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> As we intimated before our ſenſe to be, that no perſons whatſoever, who have not ſinned the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, (which few now living, if any have done:) but have the Spirit of God in ſome meaſure or degree in them: I therefore add for the further confirmation of the reaſon in hand, That men by the Spirit of God himſelf, when he reſideth in them in ſome low, and ordinary degree only, and when not ſtirred up by them, being not regarded, but neglected; I ſay, ſuch a preſence, or reſidence of the Spirit of God himſelf in men, will not put them into a meet poſture, or capacity to reſiſt Sathan, in caſe he ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf (which certainly he will) to fill them with his ſpirit. It is ſaid of Chriſt (<hi>Mar.</hi> 6.5.) That being in <hi>his own Country he could do no great works there becauſe of their unbelief:</hi> The Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſpeaking of the ſame thing, or recording the ſame Hiſtory, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 13.58.) rendereth it thus: That <hi>he did not many mighty works,</hi> &amp;c. Now that which <hi>Matthew</hi> expreſſeth only in theſe terms, <hi>That he did not, Mark,</hi> expreſſing the ſame thing, doth it with more Emphaſis and weight, namely: <hi>That he could there do no mighty works,</hi> &amp;c. He could not work himſelf to be willing to do any great works: he had not any motive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him to incline his will that way: but on the other hand, a grand diſwaſive from it, and that which did quench and take off his will, and made him liſtleſs to any ſuch action, namely, their unbelief. Now what a man cannot will to do, he may properly enough be ſaid not to be able to do; becauſe a conſent, or concurrence of the will, is every whit as neceſſary to an action as the ability or power of acting. There are two things equally neceſſary to every action: The one is, That the will be conſenting thereunto; The other is, That the perſon ſo willing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting have a reſpective power, or ability of acting: when either of theſe ſhall be wanting, the thing or action can never be done or performed. As if a man have not a will unto a thing or action, impoſſible it is that ever it ſhould proceed from him, or by his means. Now certain it is, that the will cannot riſe up unto a conſent and concurrence with the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:95016:24"/>executive power in order to an action, unleſs it have potent and congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motives (one, or more) to help it up, or raiſe it: No man can will any thing but only that which he conceiveth to be good, there being no other object capable of affecting or moving the will: So then, <hi>the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Miracles,</hi> or great works about <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the ſottiſh and wilful unbelief of the people conſidered, had not in the underſtanding of Chriſt <hi>rationem boni,</hi> the conſideration of good in it; and ſo it was impoſſible that his will ſhould be moved, and affected by it, to conſent unto it; and conſequently it may very properly be ſaid, that he could not do any ſuch things. In the ſame dialect of ſpeech, the Spirit of God himſelf may be ſaid not to be able to oppoſe and reſit Satan in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to fill men with ſin and wickedneſs, when his preſence in and with men is deſpiſed and neglected, when they take no knowledge of his being ſo near unto them, nor of his gracious offers to relieve, help, and aſſiſt them againſt their ſpiritual enemies. For though his power of executing, namely, for the fruſtrating and diſſolving the attempts of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than which we are ſpeaking of, be not impaired, nor (indeed) impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable (to ſpeak properly) by any negligence, unfaithfulneſs, or unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of men whatſoever; Yet the exerting, or putting forth of this power of his in ſuch caſes, may be hindred by men, namely, when they ſhall ſo demean themſelves towards him, that he hath no conſideration before him to render him willing to do it, but many to make him unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Hence it comes to paſs that the Spirit may truly and properly be ſaid not to be able to exert his power, or not to unbare his arm for the aſſiſting of men in their reſiſting and vanquiſhing of Sathan in ſuch attempts as we ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>Another Scripture of the ſame character with the others even now mentioned you have, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.17. Where our Saviour, ſpeaking of the Spirit, tells his Deſciples, that <hi>the world cannot receive him;</hi> the reaſon he renders, is, becauſe <hi>it</hi>) namely, the world) <hi>ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him:</hi> So that the reaſon why the world did not receive the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in that meaſure that the Diſciples did, is, becauſe they did not <hi>ſee him, neither know him.</hi> Though he be near unto them, yea, though he be in their hearts by his word; yet they not minding nor contemplating this word of his, nor regarding his motions in their ſouls, but ſuffering the eyes of their minds to be fixed upon this preſent world, and the ſins and vanities thereof, do not ſee him though he be near unto them, and ready to do great things for them, had they a mind to imploy him: But their thoughts, and mind being otherwiſe engaged, and entangled, they do by this means, and during the Regency of ſuch principles, render themſeles (upon the matter) in an utter incapacity of <hi>receiving the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;</hi> becauſe they favour ſo much of the Spirit of this world, and render themſelves ſuch a kind of ſinners, and ſuch an unworthy generation, that the Spirit of God can have no will, or luſt, can take no pleaſure or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95016:25"/>content to manifeſt himſelf unto them. This is the ſecond conſideration, by which you may perceive, that unleſs men ſhall take a courſe <hi>to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Spirit of God,</hi> they will lay themſelves open and obnoxious to be filled with ſome unclean ſpirit or other.</p>

                  </label> And will he not, doth he not, for his own name ſake (as the Scriptures often ſpeak) put forth his might and ſtrength to aide and aſſiſt men and women againſt Sathan, and his evil practices towards them, when, and where he pleaſeth, without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or inducement from them by way of compliance with him, or any goodneſs of behaviour in one kind or other towards him? How then can we ſay that it doth depend upon any compliance of the creature Man with him, or any kind of behaviour of his towards him?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> moſt true it is, That the Spirit of God is a moſt gracious and free-working Spirit, exerting, and putting forth himſelf, riſing up in his might and heavenly vigour, where, when, and in whom he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: Nor doth he receive Laws, Terms, or Directions from men for any of his motions or actions in the world, but from himſelf, his own grace and wiſdom only.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer further, That though the Spirit of God be moſt gracious and free in all his operations and workings; Yet, as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> ſpeaking of the Promiſe of the Lord Chriſt concerning his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaith, <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his Promiſe, as ſome men count ſtackneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9. Even ſo ſay I of the Spirit of Chriſt, That he is neither gracious, nor free-working, as ſome men count gracious and free-working, he is neither the one, nor the other in any way of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety unto himſelf, I mean, either to his own holineſs, or his love of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in men, nor yet to his wiſdom, or the intereſt of his glory, but only in a direct and clear conſiſtency with theſe. Some mens imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or notion concerning the gracious and free working diſpoſition of the Spirit of God is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there have been, and are ſome men, to whom he never hath, nor ever will vouchſafe his gracious preſence to the leaſt degree, and meerly out of his freedom, hath willed never to have to do with them little, or much; not becauſe of any peculiar ſtrain of wickedneſs in them, but meerly, and only (as I even now ſaid) from his own will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the other hand they conceive, That God vouchſafeth ſuch a preſence unto ſome others, ſo powerful and effectual, that they are not able to reſiſt the motions, influences, and workings of it: but are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated thereby to repent, believe, and work righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And laſtly, Others notion of this grace and working of the Spirit is ſuch, as if no courſe or ſtrain of ſin and wickedneſs whatſoever in men, though ſtill perſiſted in, no impenitency, no neglect, or contempt,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95016:25"/>whether precedent, or preſent of the Goſpel, and of the great Salvation offered therein, were, or are any way conſiderable, as to the obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting or hindering the Spirit of God from vouchſafing even the richeſt, higheſt, and fulleſt meaſure of himſelf and his gracious preſence unto them. <hi>Now that Neither the grace of God, nor the freedom of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in working</hi> is to be eſtimated, meaſured, or computed by any ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or principles as theſe hath been already ſufficiently evinced, and proved, and might here be done again would it not occaſion too long a digreſſion. <hi>That graciouſneſs and freedom of working</hi> which the Scripture any where, yea, and ſound reaſon it ſelf, aſſerts unto the Spirit of God, conſiſts and ſhews it ſelf in theſe particulars:</p>
               <p>Firſt, All men without exception having ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by juſtly deprived themſelves of all friendly converſe and communion with God; yea, and juſtly incurred his high diſpleaſure, hatred, and indignation: There was nothing of any engaging, or inviting, much leſs of any obliging import in man to move or encline the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to have any thing more to do with him in any way of love, favour, mercy, goodneſs, or the like, to the daies of Eternity: So that God having been pleaſed, notwithanding this low, and deſpicable condition of his Creature man, to comport with him again upon terms of grace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and to offer himſelf unto him; namely, to be re-enjoyed upon terms (and theſe very poſſible to be performed) by him, and to put him into a capacity of bleſſedneſs and glory, his former provocations notwithſtanding: muſt needs be matter of pure and meer grace, and conſequently of free grace, ſo far as it was matter of grace at all.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall ſay, The miſery and ſad extremity of the Creature man, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> in the condition wherein he had now plunged himſelf, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>
                  </label> might be ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cauſe unto God, or upon God, to look back again in mercy towards him: And ſo in this reſpect there might be ſomewhat in man inviting him unto that merciful compliance with him, which now he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed, and conſequently, his grace in this vouchſafement is not ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and purely free.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwers. </seg>
                  </label> That no man (as I ſuppoſe) ever oppoed miſery unto grace, or freeneſs of grace in him that ſheweth mercy or relieveth. It is not repugnant to the greateſt freeneſs of grace that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that a man ſhould be induced to vouchſafe help, ſhew mercy, and relieve a perſon that is in miſery, yea, upon the occaſion thereof, or that his miſery ſhould be an inducement thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That compliance, which God vouchſafed unto his Creature man, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as now miſrable, is not properly matter of grace, or an act of grace, but of mercy: ſo that though the mercy of God, out of which he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed means of relief unto man, may be ſaid to have been invited, or wrought upon by his miſery; and in this reſpect not ſo abſolutely free: Yet this hinders not, but that the grace of God (properly ſo called) out of which
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95016:26"/>he hath been moved to do any thing for the good of this Creature of his, may be abſolute, and in all reſpects every way free: For the object, or opportunity for grace to ſhew it ſelf, or for to act, is not in ſtrictneſs of conſideration, miſery, or extremity: theſe are the appropriate objects, and opportunities of mercy. But the proper opportunity for grace to ſhew it ſelf, is either:</p>
               <p n="1">1. A flat, or dead irrelativeneſs in point of merit in him to whom grace is ſhewn, or to be ſhewn, in reference unto him that is ſuppoſed to ſhew grace, ſo that the perſon is no waies beholding, no waies debtor unto him, to whom he is willing to ſhew himſelf gracious: Or elſe,</p>
               <p n="2">2. A relation of demerit, injury, or provocation in him to whom grace is ſhewed, towards him that ſheweth grace, or dealeth graciouſly by him: So that he that ſheweth grace, hath not only no tye, or ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all upon him to ſhew any ſuch thing; but on the other hand, hath much before him to diſſwade and take him off from it: Now, if he ſhall be pleaſed to overlook all theſe injuries, and ſhall (theſe) notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding deal graciouſly, and ſhew kindneſs, this is properly an act of grace.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither was it ſimply, or only the miſery wherein men lay plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that wrought upon the mercy of God ſo far as to move, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him to open that door of relief and deliverance unto him which now he hath done; but it was his miſery ſo, and ſo circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated in one reſpect or other: as is evident from hence; becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the miſery whereinto thoſe more excellent Creatures of his, the lapſed Angels, are fallen, being every whit as great, if not far greater, than that of man, would have had the ſame motive or operation upon the mercy of God to do the like for them, which the miſery of man had; and ſo have prevailed with him to have provided deliverance for them alſo. But this only by the way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. (And laſtly for this) That which was properly matter of grace in God towards man being fallen, was not procured, or drawn from him by any thing in man any waies obliging him thereunto, or by any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration whatſoever relating unto man, or his condition; But was every way free, meerly, intirely, and abſolutely from himſelf. And this is one thing, and the firſt thing wherein the graciouſneſs, and freeneſs of acting in the Spirit of God conſiſts: <hi>viz.</hi> That without any moving or obliging cauſe whatſoever from without, or on mans part, He is pleaſed to intreat him ſweetly, and lovingly, and to come unto him (as it were from heaven) to viſit him, to converſe with the Children of men in the ſecret of their hearts and ſouls, to inſtruct and teach them the things of their eternal peace, to admoniſh and excite them to the imbracing and proſecuting of them, yea, and to follow them with his Promiſe to look after them, and aſſiſt them. And theſe things he doth to all men without
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95016:26"/>exception to a certain degree when they firſt come by the uſe of their judgments and underſtanding, and by the putting forth of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences to be capable of them; yea, and doth increaſe, and advance theſe his gracious workings in them, untill either by a long continued neglect of his preſence with them, or by ſome higher hand of ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs practiced in oppoſition to ſuch gracious motions and tranſactions of his within them, they weary him, and quench thoſe gracious operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which his preſence affordeth unto them, and bring it ſo to paſs that he taketh no pleaſure or delight in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> Another thing (and that which already in part hath been mentioned) wherein the graciouſneſs and freedom of the Spirit of God in his working conſiſts, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he is pleaſed ſweetly and graciouſly to intreat men not only without any cauſe on their part moving or obliging him thereunto: But againſt many provocations that might in reaſon have perſwaded him to the contrary; I mean to have abſented himſelf from them, and to have abandoned, and abhorred them for ever, and left them to have periſhed in their ſin eternally. Who can number all that variety of ſins and provocations which centred and met together in and about that firſt and great tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam?</hi> What ſtrain of ſin and wickedneſs was there wanting? There was unthankfulneſs, pride, unbelief, contempt of God, ſenſuality, murther of Poſterity, and that without end, and what not (almoſt) of all that the ſoul of God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth? And all this great concourſe and aſſembly of all ſorts of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties and Provocations, from the greateſt to the leaſt of them, were as ſo many Orators, and Pleaders againſt man before God, and diſſwaders of him from ever reſpecting, or taking the leaſt care or thought what became of him: and yet the grace of God, and of the good Spirit, (as we have both heard and known to our comfort) hath through that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant freeneſs thereof magnified it ſelf againſt them all. It had been grace, yea, freeneſs of grace (in the ſtricteſt conſideration of both words) if God, or the Spirit of God ſhould have moved in mercy, or love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his creature Man upon a level, or plain ground, I mean, without any worthineſs or deſert, or any inviting conſideration in man: But that the Spirit of God ſhould be in his viſiting of men like a river of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter running up a ſteep hill; my meaning is, ſhould vouchſafe to make applications of himſelf unto them, in order to their eternal peace, againſt ſuch height, and fierceneſs of demerit, injury, and provocation, is (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) ſomewhat more than ſimply and meerly free grace, if we had a word of more excellent ſignification to expreſs it by; and the truth is, we want words to expreſs it: For that grace which God hath vouchſafed unto men in their ſalvation, and in the means thereof, and in the great condeſcenſion of the Spirit of God unto men, is more, and ſomewhat of a higher nature, it carries a richer, and more glorious notion in it than ſimply of grace, of meer grace, or of free grace; becauſe this free grace
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95016:27"/>might have been ſhewed unto men, in caſe they had never ſinned. It was the grace of God to create man upon thoſe terms that he did, to put him in a capacity of continuing in that honour and happineſs wherein he was created, and to adorn him with ſuch rich and excellent qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; becauſe the Creature could deſerve none of theſe things, it could deſerve nothing before it was: But having ſinned, for God to exhibit ſuch terms of love, and goodneſs, and bounty, as he hath done, this is ſomewhat more, if we know what to call it, than meer grace, or free grace. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes it more than ſo: and an higher expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it than his, I think, could not have been given down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (at leaſt,<note place="margin">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> A third thing, wherein the graciouſneſs and freeneſs of the Spirit conſiſts,<note place="margin">Huge Grot. in <hi>Rom. 5.20.</hi>
                  </note> is, that in all that he acts, and moves, and works in men, according to all that variety and manifoldneſs of working, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from him at any time, he doth proceed by his own Laws, and theſe every waies gracious, full of equity and ſweetneſs; and not by any thing, any Law, engagement, or terms impoſed upon him by men. When men by <hi>having</hi> (as the Scripture expreſſion is) that is, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying and improving what they have (<hi>viz.</hi> from the Spirit; for men have nothing of any ſpiritual or gracious import but from him) come to have more given, (<hi>viz.</hi> by this gracious Spirit) more light, more knowledge, more wiſdom, love, zeal, courage, faithfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they come by this means to <hi>have in abundance.</hi> Now they that <hi>have</hi> (in this ſenſe according to our Saviours promiſe) this advance of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and growing tenour of his operation, do not procure or draw it from him by any vertue, or engagement of merit, nor by any terms im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon him by the endeavours, actings, or improvements of their own; but only the rich efficacy and vertue of his moſt gracious good pleaſure and will, who was pleaſed to preſcribe the Law of this grace and goodneſs unto himſelf. As when God juſtifies and ſaves thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, he doth it freely of himſelf, and from himſelf, becauſe he hath made this Law unto himſelf, and eſtabliſhed it; he hath publiſhed and declared, <hi>That whoſoever believeth in Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be juſtified,</hi> and conſequently, <hi>ſaved,</hi> he doth it freely, and of meer grace, not by judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf obliged to do it by any worth or merit found in mens belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and yet he doth it conſtantly <hi>toties quoties,</hi> and without failing; as oft as he meets with believers in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he juſtifieth them, he ſaveth them. And (indeed) it is impoſſible he ſhould do otherwiſe, becauſe (as the A poſtle informeth us) he cannot lie, neither can he deny
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95016:27"/>himſelf in his truth and faithfulneſs: In like manner the Spirit of God hath preſcribed unto himſelf the like Laws and terms for all his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, dealings, and proceedings with men according to the tenour whereof, he will inlarge and advance his preſence in the hearts, and ſouls, and ſpirits of men, and will not walk contrary to them, nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance or put forth himſelf in any eminency of working; but only where his lower or former motions have been obeyed, and conſented unto: Yet he doth not this becauſe men regard his preſence, but becauſe he regards his own righteous counſels and purpoſes. That which the Creature doth in this caſe, is but a weak and inconſiderable thing to ingage ſuch an infinite Spirit, as the Spirit of God is, to do ſuch great things as thoſe in men. And as God will not ſave thoſe that believe, becauſe of any merit that is in their Faith, but becauſe the counſel of his will is ſo to do: So the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God will not do as hath been ſaid, becauſe of any worthineſs in mens compliance with him, but he hath made this for a Law unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (and honoureth his own Law, and himſelf too, by obſerving it) <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundantly: but from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath.</hi> Now we ſhall prove from that very paſſage, that it is a Law which the Holy Ghoſt hath made, and declares that he would walk by it towards the Sons and Daughters of men in all their ſucceeding Generations to the worlds end. <hi>To him that [hath]</hi> that is, that ſhews that he hath, that declares that he hath, that improves and imploys that which he hath, (namely, that which is given originally to him by way of ſtock from the Spirit of God) <hi>to him,</hi> that thus <hi>hath, ſhall be given;</hi> namely, by way of addition, he ſhall have more abundantly; he ſhall ſtill be going on, and be having, and having, and having; he ſhall have, and have ſtill: At laſt he ſhall have abundance, he ſhall have a full and glorious eſtate in Spiritual riches, in wiſdom, in knowledge, in underſtanding, in Faith, in humility, in love, in zeal, in temperance, in patience, and whatever elſe is neceſſary to enrich the ſoul of a man, and to prepare him, and put him into a capacity of the richeſt and higheſt glory. So that we ſee this is a clear and declared method, by which the Holy Ghoſt will proceed with men and women in his communications of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto them. And though their be nothing in the creature to invite and move him in this kind, yet nevertheleſs there is his own wiſdom, his own righteouſueſs and goodneſs, by which he made this Law, and impoſed it upon himſelf: theſe are ſacred ingagements upon him, to do all that he doth in the caſe we ſpeak of. And (doubtleſs) there was abundance of reaſon which did induce him to it: whereof though we be not ſo capable (for his Counſels are very deep) yet ſomething in the buſineſs may, with good probability, be conceived by us. But for the thing it ſelf, he (it ſeems) will do it as conſtantly as univerſally (at leaſt in his ordinary diſpenſations) as if it were the greateſt injuſtice in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95016:28"/>him, and moſt inconſiſtent with the rectitude and purity of his nature, not to do it.</p>
               <p>It may be here objected, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Firſt, That when with the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, we ſay, <hi>that unto him that hath ſhall be given,</hi> and interpret this to be meant of the Holy Ghoſt, advancing his preſence and operations in men, even as they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto him, and (reſpectively) comport with him in his preventing and lower motions; And ſo again on the other hand, <hi>That from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath,</hi> underſtand it of the Spirits withdrawing of himſelf from men, and falling lower and lower in his preſence, and motions, proportionably to mens unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, neglect, and oppoſition to him: we do not conceive either of the one or the other of theſe Lawsor Rules, as if the Holy Ghoſt would univerſally, and in all caſes whatſoever, bind himſelf unto them, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to that in either of them, which beareth hard upon the Creature; but that our Saviours meaning was only to declare unto the world what the Common Laws or terms of the Spirits proceedings and dealings with men would be, and what men were to truſt to, and expect ordinarily from him, and ſo bethink themſelves of behaving themſelves according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If you ask me, what I mean by that which beareth hard upon the Creature in each of the Laws or Rules mentioned? I anſwer, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former Rule, <hi>to him that hath, ſhall be given;</hi> if it ſhould be meant, that the Holy Ghoſt will give unto none, but unto him that hath, (that is) that improveth and maketh uſe of what he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, this would bear hard upon the Creature. By bearing hard, I do not mean any manner of injuſtice or unrighteouſneſs, or hard dealing of the Holy Ghoſt towards men; but only ſuch a thing, which if it ſhould take place, and be done, would turn to the damage or loſs of the Creature, as it muſt needs do unto many, if that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould give only unto thoſe, and to none other but thoſe that are ſaid to <hi>have:</hi> becauſe the greateſt part of men <hi>have</hi> not (in the ſenſe of this ſaying) but the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95016:28"/>Holy Ghoſt may walk by this Rule; that is, may give to every one that hath (in the ſenſe declared) and yet may give to many alſo that have not: as a rich man may give relief to all his poor neighbours, and yet ſometimes give an alms to him that is a ſtranger alſo. As to the latter Law, <hi>From him that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath,</hi> it is not neceſſary to ſuppoſe, neither, that this ſhould import, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould univerſally, or in all caſes without exception, wholly deſert or forſake him that <hi>hath not,</hi> (that is) doth not alwaies entertain his motions reſpectfully, and apply himſelf unto them. Nay, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that in the rigour of this ſenſe this Law is never obſerved by him. For according to this ſenſe it would follow, that if a man ſhould for never ſo ſhort a time, were it but for a day, or an hour, deal unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Holy Ghoſt, neglect, or reject his motions, that he would out of hand totally and finally withdraw himſelf from him. But as to this point, the Scriptures frequently ſhew the caſe to be far otherwiſe, and that the Spirit of God is full of patience and long-ſuffering towards men, even towards froward and gain-ſaying men, waiting a long time upon them, if yet they will conſider and bethink themſelves of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with him. <hi>How long ye ſimple ones</hi> (ſaith the Spirit of wiſdom, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.22. to fooliſh and froward men) <hi>will ye love ſimplicity,</hi> &amp;c. which ſhews that this Spirit had for a long time attended upon them. And ſo 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15. <hi>The Lord God of their Fathers ſent unto them by his Meſſengers, riſing up betimes and ſending; becauſe he had compaſſion on his people, and on his dwelling place. And they mocked the meſſengers of God, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Prophets, and miſuſed his meſſengers, untill the wrath of God roſe upon them, and there was no remedy.</hi> This paſſage plainly ſheweth, that the Spirit of God fought (as it were) a pitched battel with them, or rather with their wickedneſs, endeavouring to overcome it. He had them under his hand, and was perſwading and inſtructing them for a long time, before he withdrew himſelf wholly from them.</p>
               <p>And therefore when our Saviour threatens, <hi>from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away,</hi> &amp;c. the meaning, firſt, muſt needs be this: <hi>From him that hath not, (viz.)</hi> within ſome conſiderable time, after that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God hath graciouſly intreated him, and lovingly ſtroven with him. He that doth not within the time of a man (as we may ſay) that is, in which men may very well, and (as we uſe to ſay) at leiſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think themſelves of the grand concernments of their ſouls, and within which, uſually ſuch men, as do ever repent, are wont to repent, and return unto God; from ſuch a man the Spirit of God will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Concerning that clauſe, <hi>ſhall be taken away even that he hath;</hi> the meaning is not, as if all that ſuch a man hath, all the preſence, or gifts, or gracious workings of the Spirit, ſhall be withdrawn from him ſuddenly, or at once; <hi>but ſhall be taken away (viz.)</hi> by degrees,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95016:29"/>and in time: Such a man ſhall ſtill be on the loſing and declining hand, as long as he is amongſt the number of thoſe that <hi>have not,</hi> and at laſt will be ſtripped of all, and left utterly naked.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) That which I would have eſpecially to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in this Minatory, or Penal Law, aſſerted by the Scripture, <hi>From him that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath,</hi> is not ſo to be underſtood, either as if in no caſe, or for no accommodation, either of the Goſpel, or of Men, or of the Glory of God, or the like, it were diſpenſable; or as if the Holy Ghoſt had ſo obliged himſelf by it, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no occaſion whatſoever he would vary from it; but this Law is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in Heaven upon theſe terms, that it ſhould be the expreſs, the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and ordinary courſe, which the Holy Ghoſt would obſerve in treating with men, about the great matters of their peace, and that no man ſhall expect other dealings from him, the ſaid Law being moſt equitable and juſt, meeteſt (indeed) to be the ſtanding Law of his tranſactions with men; however, in ſome ſpecial caſes, a ſtrict obſervance of it might not be ſo expedient.</p>
               <p>It is very frequent in the Scriptures, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> for God to deliver and expreſs as well threatnings, as promiſes, abſolutely, in reſpect of the tenour or form of words wherein they are delivered, without the leaſt whiſper or noyſe of any exception or clauſe of reſtriction; when as notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the one, and the other, are conditional, and were by him inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for none other: Inſtances of Conditional Promiſes, delivered in words abſolute, and without mention of any Condition, we may find, 1 <hi>Sam,</hi> 2.30. <hi>I ſaid indeed</hi> (ſpeaking unto <hi>Ely</hi>) <hi>that thy Fathers houſe ſhould walk before me for ever;</hi> there was no Condition expreſſed in this Promiſe of God unto <hi>Ely</hi> his Fathers houſe: But yet it is clear in <hi>Ely</hi> his own caſe, and the inſtance of his own perſon, that God in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe intended a Condition which he had reſerved to himſelf, which was, that in caſe his Father, and thoſe of his Poſterity, ſhould walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſerve him in the great Office and Dignities of the Prieſthood, as became the Honour, and Holineſs, and Majeſty of it, then the Prieſthood ſhould never have been tranſlated from him. And ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 27.24. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>that an Angel of God appeared unto him, bidding him to be of a good courage, God had given him the lives of all that were in the Ship with him.</hi> Now, though this was abſolutely delivered unto <hi>Paul</hi> by the Angel, yet in the 31 verſe it appears that it was a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal promiſe, for (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to thoſe in the Ship concerning the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) <hi>except theſe abide in the ſhip ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> And ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13. <hi>When I ſhall ſay unto the righteous man, he ſhall ſurely live;</hi> that is, when I ſhall declare it as my poſitive and real purpoſe and intention, yet <hi>if he ſhall truſt to his own righteouſneſs, and commit iniquity,</hi> notwithſtanding this promiſe of mine, <hi>in his iniquity he ſhall dye.</hi> And (indeed) more generally all the threatnings of deſtruction denounced by God againſt
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95016:29"/>wicked and ungodly perſons, you ſhall find them (more generally I ſay, if not conſtantly) delivered in poſitive and abſolute forms of ſpeech, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God. Be not deceived; neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall inherite the Kingdom of God.</hi> Here you ſee that this threatning againſt wicked men is deliver'd abſolutly. And yet we all know, that there is a Condition of repentance included; which intervening keepeth off the threatning from being executed upon the offender. If a man be a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous perſon, or an unclean perſon, the threatning goeth forth againſt him abſolutely; and yet, through the grace of the Goſpel, if this perſon ſhall repent, and turn him from the evil of his ways, he ſhall not be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Kingdom of God. <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.4. <hi>Yet forty daies and Nineveh ſhall be deſtroyed;</hi> yet we know, that forty and twice forty daies paſſed over their heads, and yet the City not deſtroyed: The reaſon was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the threatning was but Conditional, though not a letter or tittle of it did appear unto <hi>Jonah</hi> untill the event declared it. So that, when by authority of our Saviour his declaration of that great Law of heaven mentioned touching the Holy Ghoſts proceedings, and treatings with men, in and about the great matters of their Salvation, we teach and affirm, that the Holy Ghoſt ſtill advanceth, or retreateth in the ſouls of men, as his entertainment is, either kind or unkind; We do not intend to affirm, either that there never was, or that there never will be any caſe wherein he will not take liberty to act above the line of that grace which is ſtretched over the world in that Law: But only thus (as hath been already touched) that the Law mentioned (ſo underſtood as has been opened) is the common Law, it is all the Law God would have the world to take notice of; in particular, and according unto which he would have men expect meaſure from him, and from his Spirit. If ſometimes he acts by another Law, this is but <hi>Lex horae</hi> (as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors are wont to call a Precept or Law given man in an extraordinary Caſe) the Law of an hour; whereas the other is, <hi>Lex ſeculi,</hi> the Law of an Age, and this doth not reflect any error, falſhood, or diſparagement upon the general Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> We have oft ſignified upon occaſion that God in Scripture treatie frequently applies himſelf unto men, in ſuch uſages, and forms of tranſactions, as are ordinarily found amongſt men themſelves, and uſed by them in their occaſions; yea, and walking with them by the ſame principles and notions of reaſon and equity, which are in requeſt amongſt them, and generally owned by them, and practiſed by thoſe of them that deal any thing regularly. Thus becauſe amongſt men, a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or Deed in writing is made good in Law by a Seal (regularly) affixed to it; therefore God will ſeal his Covenant likewiſe: And ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe amongſt men, an <hi>Oath for confirmation is an end of all ſtrife;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alſo, becauſe he would put an end to all doubtings, jealouſies,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95016:30"/>and troubleſome debates in the minds of men concerning his truth, and faithfulneſs in his Word, and great Promiſes of the Goſpel, he ſwears too. So likewiſe in Laws enacted by men, this being a common and ſtanding principle, <hi>Lex non curat particularia,</hi> the Law doth not regard and take notice of particular or extraordinary Caſes. Laws are made, and ought to be made, only for ordinary Caſes, for Caſes of ordinary and frequent occurrence or concernment amongſt men. There may be a Conſtellation, or meeting together of ſuch Circumſtances, once, or at ſome one time, which are not like to be found in the ſame Poſition again for many Ages after: And ſo may conſtitute a caſe extraordinary, like unto which another may not fall out in many Generations. Therefore men do not (nor, indeed, well can) make Laws for the regulating of ſuch Caſes, but leave all ſuch to be regulated by the known and general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of common Equity, together with the Soveraign Law, the good, and benefit, and welfare of the Publick, for which the ordinary and ſtanding Law was made. So that in caſe the benefit of a variation, or digreſſion from the ſtanding Law be manifeſtly expedient for the good and ſafety of the Publick, the ſtanding Law is not thereby violated or broken: And (doubtleſs) it was the very intention, of the Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers themſelves, that their Law, calculated for the regulating ordinary caſes only, in ſuch caſes as theſe (I mean extraordinaries) ſhould be waved: So that now, upon the account of the benefit and ſafety of the Publick, men may walk contrary to the Letter of the Law, and yet be blameleſs, and no tranſgreſſours of the Law. In like manner, when God maketh general Laws, and Rules, and declares them unto the world, that theſe are they by which he will move, and act, and treat with the children of men; his intent is notwithſtanding, to leave theſe Laws to be regulated by himſelf according to the exigency and require<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the general good, and publick benefit of mankind; which by his wiſdom he is able to eſtimate and judge of, knowing how to regulate all his proceedings with men, as well in extraordinary as ordinary caſes, for their profit, in conjunction with his own glory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> As there is nothing ought to cauſe a ſuſpenſion of, or variation from any general Law juſtly and equitably made and eſtabliſhed amongſt men, but only that ſoveraign or ſupreme Law of Laws, the good and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Society of men, for which the Law it ſelf was eſtabliſhed: So neither doth God, or the Spirit of God, at any time, or in any caſe, take liberty to digreſs or vary from his common and ſtanding Law, but only when ſome grand neceſſity, either of the glory of God, or the benefit and accommodation of men, intervene. And as in caſe thoſe, who are Law-givers amongſt men, could have foreſeen ſuch a caſe, or caſes, wherein a ſuſpenſion of a juſt and good Law could be neceſſary; it would not have been their wiſdom, nor for the intereſt of the people, to make mention of it in their Law, but to leave the regulation of ſuch
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95016:30"/>caſes to that ſupreme Law we ſpeak of. In like manner, when the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt cometh in unto, or falls upon any perſon, man or woman, on the ſudden, when they have been formerly and untill then vain, looſe, and prophane, it is upon ſome ſpecial and weighty occaſion, and of high importance for the benefit of the generallity of men; not ſo much for the benefit of any ſingle or particular perſon; no: but for matter of greater conſequence and more comprehenſive than the good or benefit of any one. I ſay, when ever God varies from a general Rule, it is alwaies in order to the benefit and relief of the communities of men, as (for example) for the preſerving and keeping alive, in the judgments and conſciences of men, ſome great principle of truth, one, or other, which was ready to dye, and ſo be loſt in thoſe parts of the world where his providence ſo acted. Now to preſerve and keep ſuch a principle alive in the ſouls and conſciences of men, if God ſhall appear in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner, or the Holy Ghoſt work out of courſe, it is a ſign that it was not likely to be preſerved by any other means; or however, not by any means ſo proper, or ſo well conſiſtent with the wiſdom of God as this. For that is to be minded: when there is any ordinary way, or means, to accompliſh any end, as (to inſtance in our preſent caſe) to preſerve and keep alive any great truth, then, and in ſuch caſes, God never betaketh himſelf to that which is extraordinary. But as to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs in hand; an inſtance may be in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> his Caſe: he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this account of Gods going out of his ordinary way of Grace, in bringing him unto himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> That it was for the benefit of men, yea, of ſuch men, who were not like to be wrought upon otherwiſe. For this cauſe (ſaith he) <hi>I obtained mercy,</hi> [not ſo much for mine own ſake principally, but] that in me <hi>Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering, for a pattern to them that ſhould afterward believe on him to eternal life,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. As if he ſhould have ſaid; God in vouchſafing that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary grace to me in my converſion, in bringing me to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did not look ſo much on my ſalvation, nor upon the great benefit that I ſhould receive from it; but was pleaſed to pitch upon me, <hi>that he might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering, for a pattern to them that ſhould afterwards believe,</hi> he ſpeaks here of his own Countrymen, the <hi>Jews,</hi> that were called, or to be called, to believe on <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And becauſe God would give an advantage unto them for their believing, being a ſtubborn and ſtiff-necked Generation, a people that had deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately rebelled againſt the Goſpel, he was pleaſed to ſet this Apoſtle <hi>as a Pattern</hi> for them; that when they had ſuch a <hi>Pattern</hi> before them, they might conceive thus with themſelves: There was a man every whit as wicked as we, as unworthy, as great an enemy to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Goſpel, as we; yet he was called, and with a high hand of acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on received, therefore (doubtleſs) we may truſt in him, and expect, that if we will ſubject to him, and come in and accept of mercy, we
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95016:31"/>ſhall be received into grace and favour alſo. So now, if there can be any ſuch inſtance produced in our daies, or in the places where we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, <hi>viz.</hi> That any extraordinary thing hath been done for men in a way of a real and through repentance and converſion, (for a ſeeming repentance and converſion may be in many where true repentance is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom wrought) but if (I ſay) there can be the truth and reality of any ſuch unuſual work of the Holy Ghoſt demonſtrated; (doubtleſs) there was, or is, ſome great principle, one or other, ſome important truth in a declining condition, in thoſe parts and places where any ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary power of God, and of his Spirit doth appear; and it is to keep alive, and in power and authority ſuch a Doctrine. As for inſtance, it may be the free grace and mercy of God, and that readineſs in him to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and receive Sinners when-ever they ſhall return unto him; this great truth (I ſay) may be ſo weakened in the judgments and minds of men, that it may need more than an ordinary confirmation: And ſo that men have no cauſe to be jealous of their former courſes, as if theſe having been ſo wretched and vile, they might repent, and yet be caſt out from God. Again, That wicked men have as much right unto, as much to do (if not more) with the Promiſes of the Goſpel, as Believers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and ſo that perſons, that have not been ſo, or ſo, humbled, or terrified by the Law, may as lawfully, yea, and as truly believe as thoſe that have been in the greateſt terrours of Conſcience by means of it; Now, for the relieving and reviving of ſuch Evangelical Principles and Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as theſe, and the like in the hearts and Conſciences of men, there may [poſſibly] be ſome extraordinary working of the Holy Ghoſt, in and about the converſion of ſome man, or ſome few.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> When God beginneth, or firſt entreth upon a new kind of Diſpenſation, or ſeries of Providence, or Adminiſtrations in the world; the firſt inſtance, or example, of ſuch a kind of diſpenſation, is not to be (indeed in ſome particular Caſes cannot be) regulated by ſuch Laws, unto which the ſubſequent practice of the ſame Adminiſtrations are to be governed afterwards: I ſay, the firſt Diſpenſation in any kind, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a reaſonable or perfect meaſure by which all other after Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations are to be meaſured. Men of reaſon and learning have delivered this for a Maxime, <hi>Primum in unoquoque genere eſt excipiendum:</hi> That the firſt of every kind of things is to be excepted (meaning, from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of the reſt:) So that in this caſe God doth go along with men in their own manner of proceedings. To make the obſervation clear; When God gave being to the firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> intending by him the propagation of great numbers of men, he did not obſerve the decrees or Laws of nature or natural production, which he doth in giving life and being to other men: So when he began that Church, the members of which were afterwards numerous, even the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> he appeared unto, and called <hi>Abraham</hi> in ſomewhat an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95016:31"/>manner: This was the firſt beginning, the head of that kind of diſpenſation in the world. For God had not a peculiar Church raiſed out of any ſtock or generation in the world before: it was to him the beginning of Churches. No marvel then that he ſhould begin this Church after another manner, and in a method ſomewhat varying from that which he took in after Ages for the propagating of the members of it: Yea, or of ſuch of the members of it, who in Faith and holineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled <hi>Abraham</hi> their head. So likewiſe when God began to take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf a Church of the Gentiles; he proceeded (we know) in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry particulars in ſomewhat an extraordinary manner; which we ſhall not at preſent ſtand to mention. We may yet take another inſtance: When God ſet on foot that great Ordinance of Circumciſion, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was, that <hi>Abraham,</hi> being now ninety nine years old, ſhould be circumcized; whereas the common and ſtanding Law for the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Ordinance afterwards, was, that the Male-child was to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcized at eight days old. So likewiſe in caſe of Baptiſm, in the beginning of this miniſtration, there was one called to this imployment in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner, and who himſelf had not been baptized, but none of the after Diſpenſations of this Ordinance was to be performed, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed upon ſuch terms, either in the one reſpect, or the other. So then, <hi>Paul</hi> being the firſt Founder under <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and great Father, of the Gentile Churches (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15.) as <hi>Abraham</hi> was (though in ſomewhat another ſenſe) of the Church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and being intended by God (as we lately heard) for a <hi>Pattern</hi> of believing unto the unbelieving <hi>Jews,</hi> it is agreeable to the general Rule concerning beginnings, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginners of Adminiſtrations (formerly mentioned) that there ſhould be ſomewhat more than ordinary in his converſion.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, But then (in the next place) though God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> for the moſt part in laying the foundation of a new Adminiſtration, doth not proceed or go by ſuch a Law, by which he doth intend to carry on the courſe of this Adminiſtration in the future practices of it, yet he doth not wholly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from, nor altogether decline, thoſe general Rules, by which he intends to carry on the ſame diſpenſation afterwards. Though it be true, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf, that he <hi>was the chiefeſt of ſinners,</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this (ſaith he) <hi>I obtained mercy, becauſe I did it ignorantly and in unbelief.</hi> Therefore there was ſomething in <hi>Paul,</hi> though far from any thing that did ballance in value or conſideration the extraordinary mercy vouchſafed unto him, yet ſomething (I ſay) there was, there was a certain negative frame of heart (as we may call it) in him, and that during all the time of his wickedneſs, which God did take notice of as comparatively good; and had it not been found in him, the grace, which he ſo much magnifies, had not been vouchſafed to him. For if therefore he <hi>was received to mercy,</hi> becauſe, though he did thus and thus wickedly and unworthily, yet he did it <hi>ignorantly and in unbelief</hi> (that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95016:32"/>is, not knowing, not believing the Goſpel to be from God, nor thoſe to be his ſervants whom he perſecuted) he did it upon lightning and eaſing Circumſtances, which took off much of the guilt and provocations of it in the eyes of God. If this was the reaſon, why he received mercy, or at leaſt, that, without which he had not received mercy, it followeth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that had he done theſe things with knowledge, and againſt the light of his judgment and conſcience, or believing the things of the Goſpel to have been true, certainly he had never ſeen that great ſalvation of God, but had been excluded from it with the reſt of the wicked of the world. So he had another ſtrain, which God was much delighted in, which was, to be zealous for him, and in his cauſe according to the real per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of his ſoul and conſcience: and therefore (ſaith he) <hi>God who counted me faithful putting me into the Miniſtry,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. And thus we ſee, that even in <hi>Pauls</hi> Converſion it ſelf, which was objected to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the credit, and diſparage the truth, of that which (from the Scriptures) we ſhewed to be the general ſtanding Law, or Rule, by which the Holy Ghoſt walks towards men in all things, wherein he hath to do with them, as in his fluxes and refluxes, in his advances, and in his retreats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We may ſee (I ſay) in the caſe of <hi>Pauls</hi> Converſion (as it hath been briefly, and in ſome particulars only, preſented) that when he doth upon ſome extraordinary occaſions recede from the ſaid Rule, yet he keeps as cloſe and near to it, as conveniently he may, he walks (as it were) within ſight of it. For though <hi>Paul</hi> had been a grievous ſinner and blaſphemer (as we heard) yet he had not debauched his conſcience, nor offered any indignity or affront to this great Vicegerent of God within him. For as himſelf afterwards (when he was not like to ſpeak an untruth, being now filled with the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi>) profeſſed; <hi>He ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought with himſelf that he ought to do many things againſt the name of Jeſus of Nazareth, Acts</hi> 26.9. And that as touching the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law he was blameleſs, Phil.</hi> 3.6. <hi>That he was zealous towards God, Acts</hi> 22, 3. And for his great ſins of <hi>perſecuting,</hi> and <hi>blaſpheming,</hi> theſe were committed by him, not only <hi>ignorantly</hi> (that is, without his knowing them to be ſins) but out of ignorance, that is, upon ſuch terms of an ingenuity of conſcience, that had he but known them to be ſins, he would not have committed them. For he that is <hi>zealous towards God,</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> was, as we lately heard) cannot but, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on knowledge and conviction that any of his waies are hateful unto God, preſently hate and abandon them. Now ſuch things as theſe being in <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion, though I am not willing to ſay (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am not confident in believing it) that they did reduce him into the number of thoſe, who, in our Saviours Rule (all this while diſcourſed) are ſaid to <hi>have</hi> (in the ſenſe formerly declared) to whom it is promiſed, that <hi>more ſhall be given,</hi> and that they <hi>ſhall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly,</hi> yet (doubtleſs) they were both of them of ſuch an import in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95016:32"/>themſelves, and of ſuch an interpretation with God, as to place him in a very near neighbourhood unto them. So that if it muſt be granted that God, or the Spirit of God did not, in <hi>Pauls</hi> Converſion, act by that Rule, which we affirmed to be his odinary or ſtanding Rule obſerved by him in his actings, yet certainly he did herein act by ſuch a rule, which holds good correſpondence therewith, and is of near affinity with it.</p>
               <p>However, By what hath been formerly argued, and ſaid, you may ſee clearly, that it is no derogation from the truth, or from the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a general rule, that there are ſome inſtances now and then that do digreſs and vary from it. The credit and authority of the Law, or Rule under preſent conſideration, is not impaired, nor at all ſhaken thereby; becauſe in ſuch Caſes there is another Rule, and Law of grace, (though this be a Law of grace too) yet there is a Law of ſuperiour grace, and of more tranſcendent goodneſs, which doth over-rule the common and ſtanding Law which God hath thought fit to propoſe unto himſelf, and unto his Spirit, for his dealing with the world. And for exceptions, it is a common ſaying and true, that an exception from a general Rule, ſtrengthens and confirms the Rule in all particulars not excepted (for there is no general Rule, as the ſaying is, that hath not ſome exceptions.) Now theſe exceptions that are to be found, from the general Rule we ſpeak of, are ſo far from taking it away, or making any breach upon it, that (indeed) they give great confirmation and authority unto it. By that ſtanding Rule we ſpeak of, God doth explain himſelf to this effect, that men ſhould not expect any extraordinary coming of the Holy Ghoſt upon them, but wait for him in his ordinary way. And the truth is, thoſe ſtanding Laws and Rules, of which we have ſpoken, may be the reſult of the choiſeſt and moſt excellent wiſdom of the Holy Ghoſt, and of God in ordaining them; and yet it may be a point of the ſame wiſdom likewiſe in ſome caſes to act contrary to them. <hi>There is a time</hi> (ſaith the wiſe man) <hi>to build, and a time to pull down;</hi> though theſe be contrary actions, yet according to the exigency of differing times, and ſeaſons, and occaſions, both may be done with a like wiſdom. So that the Holy Ghoſt may ordinarily walk by one rule, and yet in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſes may walk by another Rule, and both with uniformity unto his grace and goodneſs towards the world.</p>
               <p>But it will be ſtill objected, That the Holy Ghoſt doth not move, or act, by any determinate Law preſcribed unto himſelf, no, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> not in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary proceedings with men. For doth he not many times, ever and anon, ſhew himſelf in his might, and in the glory of his ſtrength and power, in working effectually upon the hearts and conſciences of men, that have been looſe and vain, and a long time wicked and prophane. In anſwer hereunto we might commend unto you thoſe particulars which we have formerly delivered upon this account to conſider of.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:95016:33"/>
               <p>But in the ſixth place we ſhall add this, (to the five preceding, which we will not ſtand now to name) that perſons, that have been looſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, deſpiſers of God and the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may on the ſudden, and at once, ſeem to be truly converted and brought home unto God, when that which is wrought in or upon them in this kind, is but either that which ſome call a Sermon-ſickneſs, when the Conſcience of a man is only troubled, or wounded with the dreadful concernment of the things he hears, but ſoon after recovers himſelf out of this fit, and is the ſame man he was, or worſe than before.</p>
               <p>As when <hi>Paul</hi> before <hi>Felix</hi> was reaſoning of Righteouſneſs, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Judgment to come, it is ſaid that <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. But this was but like an earthquake, under which the earth is much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and ſhaken, as if it would be removed out of its place, but ſoon after recovers, and returns to its wonted ſtability. Or elſe the work we ſpeak of, ſuddenly wrought in looſe, ſenſual, and prophane perſons may poſſibly not vaniſh and come to nothing, and yet not be a real work of Converſion; yet doth it not follow, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be found therein to recede from his own Law mentioned, <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given:</hi> becauſe (poſſibly) a man may have more in him by way of improvement within the ſpace of one hour, and perhaps in a far ſhorter time than another in the ſpace of ſeveral hours, yea, or years, and yet be an <hi>Haver</hi> too (in the ſenſe formerly declared) my meaning is this, That a man or woman, may (poſſibly) with a leſs aſſiſtance of the Spirit more effectually provoke, and ſtir up themſelves, and advance their minds, and attentions, to the hearing and conſidering of the Goſpel, the words of eternal life, when they are ſpeaking unto them, than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man with a greater meaſure of aſſiſtance of the ſame Spirit may do within the ſpace of a far longer time, and yet be doing ſomewhat all the while. As in matters of a Civil concernment, one man with a leſſer ſtock, only with more diligence and wiſdom, may advance his eſtate more within the ſpace of one year, than another with a greater ſtock, being leſs induſtrious and provident may do in three, and this man may not go backward neither. That hath been heretofore ſignified unto you, that the Holy Ghoſt ſeldom or never withdraws from any man ſo low (unleſs it be in the caſe of the unpardonable ſin) but that a perſon may, by means of his gracious preſence with him, if he will provoke and ſtir up himſelf accordingly, he may conſider the things of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal peace, and act and behave himſelf accordingly. That God is ſaid to <hi>open the heart of Lydia,</hi> Acts 16.14, <hi>So that ſhe attended to the things that were ſpoken by Paul,</hi> doth not prove that <hi>Lydia</hi> had a greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, than any other that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the preaching of the Goſpel whereby ſhe was converted: But only notes the happy event and ſucceſs, which that aſſiſtance ſhe had, had in, and upon her heart, like unto which there was none wrought or produced,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95016:33"/>in any other there preſent, by any preſence or aſſiſtance of the Spirit which they had. This is a Principle, or Rule, according to which many things are ſpoken, and are to be taken and underſtood in the Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> that when one and the ſame action is raiſed and produced by a joynt concurrence of two different cauſes: one principal and independent in its efficacy, or working, the other ſubordinate and dependent in the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof; the effect, or work, produced between them is ſometimes (as in good propriety of ſpeech it may be) aſcribed to the one, and ſometimes to the other; but more commonly to the former, that which is the principal. So that act of opening <hi>Lydia's</hi> heart, becauſe God was the principal agent in it, and cauſe independent in working it, though this was not, could not be without <hi>Lydia's</hi> act in conſenting. God opened, and ſhe opened too, for ſhe repented and believed, (ſee Rev. 3.20.) yet the work is aſcribed only unto God: But this by the way.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> (and laſtly) When there is any ſuch example in reality and truth, as the objection mentioneth (<hi>viz.</hi>) a perſon on the ſudden converted and brought home unto God, which hath formerly been looſe, vain, and prophane, there may be ſomewhat more than an ordinary preſence of the Holy Ghoſt, in and about the work, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining of that Law or Rule before mentioned; <hi>from him that hath not, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath.</hi> For it is to be ſuppoſed, and not at all to be doubted, that even <hi>he that hath not</hi> (in our Saviours ſenſe of the word <hi>have</hi>) that hath not any thing upon improvement of his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſtock, yet may have ſomewhat commodious and advantageous unto him at this turn upon the account of ſome other, one or more, that hath laboured with God in prayer for him, (I mean, for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance or converſion.) Neither do I conceive it incident to any of your thoughts, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould act or move by any ſuch rule, which ſhould render the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man, much leſs the effectual fervent prayers of many righteous men on the behalf of another, of none effect. It muſt needs (I conceive) grate upon any mans underſtanding to think ſo. For God hath commanded men to pray one for another. And Parents eſpecially are bound to lay up in Prayers for their Children, as well as in Lands, or money, and that which is laid up (or, if you will, laid out) by worthy Parents for their Children in Prayers, is like to turn to a more certain account in benefit, and good unto them, than that which is laid up, or out, for them otherwiſe. And to this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Ambroſe.</note> that ſaying of <hi>Jerome</hi> unto <hi>Monica, Auſtins</hi> Mother, who wept and prayed for her Sons Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion night and day for a long time together, whilſt he, like a loſt ſheep, was going aſtray in the errour and vain practices of the <hi>Manichees;</hi> this woman (I ſay) making her moan to <hi>Jerome</hi> about this her Son, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this anſwer from him, full of comfort, <hi>Non poteſt perire filius tot
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95016:34"/>lacrymarum:</hi> A Child that hath ſo many tears beſtowed on him by a Parent could not periſh; meaning, could not lightly periſh. As when we expreſs any great hope, concerning the obtaining or coming to paſs of a thing, we often expreſs our ſelves by ſuch a kind of Hyperbole, and ſay, It cannot be otherwiſe. For it is worthy our taking notice of, (by the way) that when we pray for the repentance, or the converſion, of a child, or friend, or whoever, if we pray regularly, and agreeable to the mind and will of God, we do neither pray ſimply, or abſolutely, for his repentance; as if in caſe he ſhould not be brought to repentance, then God cannot be ſaid to have heard, or granted our Prayers; nor yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally neither in ſuch a ſenſe, as if we ſhould, or in duty ought to leave him at liberty whether he would grant our Prayers in this kind or no, (for he hath not left himſelf at liberty in ſuch caſes, neither would he have us leave him at ſuch a liberty) but when we pray for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a Child, Husband, Wife, or any other perſon, our Prayers ought to be abſolute in this kind; that he would be pleaſed to vouchſafe to intreat the perſon, for whom we pray, very graciouſly, and effectually by his Spirit, in order to the bringing him to repentance; that he will move and encline his Will with a high hand of perſwaſive power, that if it be poſſible he may not any longer remain impenitent. This is the tenour, or effect of any Prayer that can be made adviſedly, and regularly according to the will of God, for the repentance or converſion of any. But if this be the ſenſe of our Prayers, that God would compel men to repent, or (which is the ſame, though there hath been much beating of the air to find, or rather to make a difference) that he would incline his will by an irreſiſtible power hereunto; this is not according to the will of God, nor doth he convert any man, nor will he, upon the Prayers of an Angel in Heaven, bring any man to repentance upon ſuch terms as theſe. Nor doth it ſtand with his wiſdom, nor with the great end of his glory, which he hath on foot, and carrieth on from day to day in his Government and Adminiſtration of the World. Yea, and though the repentance of the perſon, for whom we pray for upon ſuch terms, ſhould follow, yet it is not to be imputed to our Prayers, as if they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it; though (haply) that good and Chriſtian intention, out of which we may pray in ſuch a caſe, may prevail with God for that grace to be given unto him, who is prayed for, by which he is brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. So then, that which I ſay is this, That though a perſon hath been a long time looſe, careleſs, and prophane, a deſpiſer of God, and of his Grace, yet if his condition hath been frequently and fervently commended unto God by Prayer, and this by perſons of any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable intereſt in God, ſuch as <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job;</hi> all their Prayers may poſſibly meet together in one, and center in ſome more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry excitation of the heart and ſoul of ſuch a perſon by the Holy Ghoſt, as in the hearing of a Sermon, or ſome other like opportunity, by the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95016:34"/>advantage whereof he may poſſibly be brought to repent and believe. And in ſuch interpoſures of the Holy Ghoſt, as theſe, he is not to be conceived to make any digreſſion from the ſtanding and common Rule, <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given,</hi> &amp;c. For the perſon we ſpeak of, though all this while wicked and prophane, yet may be ſaid to <hi>have,</hi> upon the account of that which hath been put up to God for him, the prayers and interceſſions, the cries and tears that have been preſented by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons, who have been in favour with God: this hath been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him, and is of the ſame conſideration in Heaven, and with God in relation to his caſe and condition, as if he himſelf had made ſuch an improvement of what he <hi>had,</hi> which is wont to bring men under the bleſſing of the Promiſe. <hi>To him that hath, ſhall be given,</hi> &amp;c. And thus much for anſwer and ſatisfaction to that objection concerning the ſudden converſion of men formerly ungodly, and prophane, and for the firſt reaſon of the Doctrine. If men be not <hi>filled,</hi> or in the way of being <hi>filled</hi> with the Spirit of God, they are in danger of being filled with ſome other ſpirit.</p>

               <p>THe ſecond Reaſon of the Doctrine is this: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> Every man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is bound to <hi>be filled with the Spirit of God.</hi> Becauſe without ſuch a <hi>filling</hi> the hearts of men and women will never ſerve them to do any excellent things for God, their hands will never beſtrong enough to be lift up to the high Commandments of God; which yet doubtleſs is the duty of every Servant of God, I mean upon occaſion to lift up his hands even to the higheſt of the Commandments of God. Men and women, without ſome competent <hi>fulneſs of the Spirit,</hi> will ever and anon be apt to ſtumble, and betray the honour of God, and the peace and comfort of their own ſouls. For where there is not ſuch a fulneſs of the Spirit of God, there muſt needs be ſpace left in the hearts and ſouls of men for fooliſh apprehenſions, vain deſires, and carnal proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to lodge there; and theſe will watch their opportunity, and ſooner or later will break out and ſhew themſelves in the world: Or if they ſhould not break out into action, yet they will greatly incumber and break the very heart, and cut the ſinews of the motions and excitations
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95016:35"/>of the Spirit of God in men. The motions of the Spirit of God, where theſe inmates are, hardly thrive, or come to any maturity; but will be as the untimely fruit of a woman, which never comes to ſee the Sun.</p>
               <p>There are ſome actions ſo neceſſary to be atchieved for the honour of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that this is like to ſuffer much, unleſs they be performed. And theſe are of ſuch a contrariety to the fleſh, that unleſs men be <hi>filled with the Spirit of God,</hi> the fleſh will never give way for the performance of them; becauſe they have ſuch a deſperate antipathy to it, and to the works thereof: But when a man is full of the Holy Ghoſt, he is now ſo full of the ſenſe of the goodneſs of thoſe honourable purpoſes, that are conceived in his ſoul, and of all high atchievements in the ſervice of God, which he judgeth will be both for the glory of God, the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goſpel, and for the good of mankind, as alſo for his own peace and comfort; that there is no place left within him for the fleſh to ſuggeſt any thing to the contrary, either to take him him off from, or to retard him in the proſecution thereof; He is as full of ſuch occaſions and ingagements, as theſe, as ever he can hold, which keep out the motions and inſinuations of the fleſh. Whereas if there were room for them to interpoſe, it is a thouſand to one, but they would ſtrangle, or ſtifle all good purpoſes and reſolutions within him.</p>
               <p>You may the better underſtand what it is to be <hi>filled with the Spirit of God,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> in reference to the matter in hand, by conſidering the contrary, namely, what it is to be <hi>filled</hi> with an evil ſpirit. <hi>Why hath Satan filled thine heart to lye to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to <hi>Annanias,</hi> Acts 5.3.) The Apoſtle ſuppoſes that <hi>Satan had filled his heart,</hi> upon this ground, becauſe he had reaſon and grounds in abundance to ſpeak the truth, in as much as he ſaw and knew that <hi>Peter</hi> was indued with a miraculous and extraordinary preſence of the Spirit of God, whereby he could diſcern whether he ſpake the truth or not; but Satan had <hi>filled his heart</hi> with fooliſh imaginations, and vain conceits about the profit or benefit that he preſumed would accrue unto him by his lye; that there was no room for the conſideration of thoſe grounds and reaſons as were before him to ſpeak the truth, though theſe were pregnant and near at hand. So on the contrary, when a man is ſo full of the conſideration of the high ſervices of God, and of purpoſes and reſolutions to quit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf worthily therein, that there is no place left in his ſoul to encertain any contrary thoughts or ſuggeſtions that might inſnare him and turn him aſide; now is he <hi>full of the Spirit,</hi> and in a meet frame and poſture to lift up his heart and his hands to the great and high Commandments of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 4 8. <hi>Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghoſt, ſaid unto them, ye Rulers of the people, and Elders of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c And <hi>Acts</hi> 13.9, 10. <hi>Then Paul filled with the Holy Ghoſt ſit his eyes on him,</hi> (viz. <hi>Elimas</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer</hi>) and ſaid, <hi>O full of all ſubtilty and all miſchief,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95016:35"/>thou child of the Devil, thou enemy of all righteouſneſs, wilt thou not ceaſe to pervert the right waies of the Lord?</hi> The reaſon, why here is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the Apoſtles being <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> when he was ingaged in ſuch a notable ſervice for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as to reprove a man of that great authority and eſteem which <hi>Elimas</hi> was of amongſt them: the reaſon hereof (I ſay) was to ſhew that he was not like to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed ſuch a work as this, had he not been ſo full of the Spirit of God, that there was no room in his heart for any fearful apprehenſions, nor thoughts of danger, or reward, to obſtruct him herein. So elſewhere the Apoſtle (in a Phraſe a little differing) ſaith, <hi>Behold I go bound in the Spirit unto Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 20.22. <hi>To be bound in the Spirit,</hi> is (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter) <hi>to be filled with the Spirit.</hi> As a man that is bound hand and foot, may be ordered any way, he can make no reſiſtance, any man may carry him whither he will; So ſaith <hi>Paul, I go bound in the Spirit,</hi> or by means of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> He hath brought me into theſe bonds, having filled me with ſatisfaction touching the excellency of the ſervice that I ſhall do unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> by going to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the face of all thoſe great Enemies I ſhall there meet with: Yet ſaith he, notwithſtanding any danger that may befall me, <hi>I go bound in the Spirit;</hi> ſo <hi>filled</hi> with what the Spirit hath put into my judgment, and conſcience, and ſoul, touching the acceptableneſs of the ſervice, that I can give no audience to any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or propoſals againſt it: I cannot reſiſt the motion carrying me to it. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. The ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks of being <hi>beſides themſelves; For whether we be beſides our ſelves, it is unto God: or whether we be ſober, it is for your cauſe. For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Conſtraineth us;</hi> namely, to both kinds of practices, thoſe wherein they ſhould ſeem unto many to be beſides themſelves; and thoſe alſo wherein they ſhould ſeem to be ſober; wherein he ſuppoſeth, that there are many turns, wherein the honour of Jeſus Chriſt cannot be provided for, as it ought, but ſome men muſt act like unto men beſides themſelves to make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion: And of all kind of actions and ſervices theſe are the higheſt, and moſt ſpiritual, and of the greateſt conſequence unto the intereſt of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his affairs. And the truth is, that ſetting a very few perſons aſide, that are more ſpiritually wiſe than the common ſort of men, yea, of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> themſelves, there are not ſufficient witneſſes of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of ſuch actions but Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, becauſe the grounds and reaſons by which ſuch actions muſt be promoted are ſo high, and have ſo much of God in them, that perſons of an ordinary underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have no skill of them: they cannot caſt it, or conceive in their minds, but that ſuch a man might have done better, might have been wiſer, and might have kept a good conſcience, though he had not run ſuch an hazard, and expoſed himſelf to ſuch or ſuch a trouble, or loſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now it is only the Holy Ghoſt that can enable men to do that, can inlarge their hearts unto ſuch actions and ſervices as thoſe wherein they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95016:36"/>ſhall be looked upon as men beſides themſelves. And when the Holy Ghoſt ſhall come and <hi>fill</hi> the heart, and diſplay the worthineſs and glory of ſuch a ſervice, that ſeems vain, raſh, or needleſs in the eyes of moſt men; then the glory of it ſhall ſhine round about him, and he ſhall ſee (as in a viſion of the noon day) this conveniency and that, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and that, attending upon it, all great, and excellent, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; and by this means the heart comes to be <hi>full</hi> of it, full of the greatneſs, and the goodneſs, and the worthineſs of it; full of the ſenſe of the benefit and bleſſing, which it will bring along with it. So that though all the world ſhould riſe up againſt him, to diſſwade him from it, they could not do it: For (in ſuch a caſe) there would be no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, no roomth in his heart or ſoul for any carnal diſſwading interpoſure to enter, or to intermeddle about taking him off from it. As when the glory of the Lord had filled the Temple, the Prieſts could not enter into it, (to do their Office, or any work belonging to them here) 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.2. In like manner, when the Holy Ghoſt hath filled the Temple of the ſoul with the glory of great and high ingagements for God, and for the Goſpel, ſuch reaſonings and conceits, which are wont to purvey for the fleſh, and to ſacrifice all that comes to net, pleaſures, and profits unto it, cannot now find entrance hither, to inveigle, or intice the hearts or conſciences of men to hearken unto them. So that we ſee the truth of this reaſon, That unleſs men and women <hi>be filled with the Spirit of God,</hi> they will never be able to advance in ſuch waies, and courſes, and to hold out in many practices, and ſervices, without which the honour of God, the reputation and credit of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt</hi> cannot be maintained like unto themſelves in the world. The Goſpel will ſuffer loſs, and loſe ground, unleſs it be held up, and the preſent intereſt of it maintained by ſome ſuch worthy practices and undertakings of the Saints, as thoſe we have now ſpoken of; and which we have ſhewed will hardly be attempted, much leſs performed, and carried through with that height of courage and reſolution, which will make the face of the Goſpel to ſhine, unleſs they, that ſhall be called to be Actors of them, ſhall be ſo emptied of themſelves, as to be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and by this means be lifted up above themſelves.</p>

               <p>THe third Reaſon of the Doctrine is this: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> Every man ſtands bound upon this account to <hi>be filled with the Spirit of God.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe otherwiſe a man will never become any great and ſignal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor unto the world: He will never bleſs, or ſerve his Generation at any worthy rate, or as become<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h an heir apparent to life and immortality to do. There are two things in this Reaſon, the one ſuppoſed or taken for granted, as clear and evident enough in it ſelf; the other plainly affirmed. That which is ſuppoſed is this, That it is every mans duty to become a Benefactor, and this in ſome degree conſiderable unto the world: This is nothing but what every man ſtands charged with by God; I mean to be ſingularly, and ſignally active for the real and crue intereſt of the world, whilſt he continueth and abideth in it. That which is plainly laid down and affirmed, is, That a man without being <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> will never be in any rich or competent capacity to perform his duty in this kind. Now concerning the former, though it be a truth ſhining clear enough with its own light, yet becauſe every mans eyes (haply) are not ſufficiently opened to ſee it, let us make a little eye-ſalve of the Word of God to anoint them with, that they may be opened to ſee it. Firſt then, that all men are bound to believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> at leaſt all men that have the Goſpel preached unto them (though there be little queſtion, indeed, of others.) Secondly, That they are bound to do the beſt they can to make the world believe this concerning them; I mean that they do (indeed) believe on him. As will the one as the other, of theſe is (I ſuppoſe) every mans apprehenſion, and no mans queſtion or doubt. Now if this be true: Full, that every
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95016:37"/>man and woman of us ſtands bound to believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And ſecondly, to do that which is proper and ſufficient to convince the world that we do thus believe, it evidently followeth, That every man ſtands bound to do ſome great and worthy thing for the World, and to be a Bleſſing to his Generation. For there is nothing, lies within the ſphere of humane activity, of more worthy or higher accommodation, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment unto the World, than to preſent it with a clear Viſion of the ſight of a man Believing with his whole heart in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or elſe to ſhew unto men the ſight of the World it ſelf Conquered, and Overcome by a man. With both theſe ſights every ſuch man or woman preſenteth the World, who telleth the World, with authority and power, (that is, by a manifeſt contempt of the World in all, that it can either do for him or againſt him,) that he believeth in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> There is not a greater ſight to be ſhewed, or ſeen in the world, than to ſhew it plainly, and cauſe it to ſee diſtinctly, the heart of a throughout Believer in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or to ſhew it in like manner the World Overcome by a weak and mortal man. Now both theſe ſights a man doth ſhew when he doth caſt contempt upon the World: Such a man preſents the World with both theſe, with a man really believing in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and with a man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the World under his feet. Moſt men, when they pretend, or go about, to let the World know that they believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſpeak like unto the Spirits of Divination: the manner of whoſe ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> deſcribeth, by <hi>peeping</hi> and <hi>muttering,</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.19.) as if they were afraid to ſpeak out, or plainly, leſt they ſhould be taken tardy with ſpeaking a lye; being conſcious to themſelves of their inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity (poſitively) to declare the truth concerning the things which are inquired about at their hands by their Proſelites and Cuſtomes. In like manner, the generality of Profeſſors amongſt us, who pretend to give the world to know that they believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> do but <hi>peep</hi> and <hi>mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> their lives and doings ſpeak their Faith but brokenly, and indiſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; they do but whiſper, ſo that the generality of men can underſtand but little of what they ſay in this kind: They ſpeak in their way as men that were jealous, and half afraid, leaſt in time they ſhould, or might, be diſcovered to ſpeak untruth, when they ſay they believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Such a broken, intricate, and uncertain account, as this, given by men unto the World that they believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> doth no great ſervice unto the World. For all ſuch a reſtimony, or aſſertion of theſe mens believing in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the World will be at liberty, and find it ſelf looſe enough, from being perſwaded, or convinced, that ſuch men do in deed and in truth believe in him. And whilſt they remain at liberty in this kind, they are but where they were; the Faith of a perſon made known but by halves, hath but a weak influence, but a faint operation upon men; being like unto a <hi>Trumpet,</hi> that <hi>gives an uncertain ſound,</hi> upon which <hi>no man prepares unto the battel</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh.)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95016:37"/>But now he that ſhall ſpeak out, ſhall ſpeak plainly, and without a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that ſhall with authority give, or rather make the World to know, that he doth really and in truth believe on <hi>Chriſt;</hi> he will do ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy execution upon them, he will make work to ſome purpoſe in the hearts and conſciences of men: Such a teſtimony will cauſe men to <hi>awake out of their ſleep, and ſtand up from the dead,</hi> and ſo prepare and put them in an immediate capacity of receiving the light of life from <hi>Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 5.14</p>
               <p>We know there is an attracting, an encouraging, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2,</label> and provoking force in Example to the ſimilitude and likeneſs of actions; yea, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the ſimilitude of paſſions or of ſufferings alſo, at leaſt, to the adventure making of like ſuffering; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Many waxed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident by his bonds and ſuffering,</hi> (<hi>Phil.</hi> 1.14.) and were hereby much more bold <hi>to ſpeak the Word without fear.</hi> For ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> make no more of his bonds than he did, they began to think that ſuffering perſecution for the Goſpel was no very great matter. Therefore now they alſo would preach the Word confidently and with all boldneſs, as he had done. In like manner, when men ſhall ſee the World neglected, trodden and trampled upon, by a perſon believing in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by means of this his believing, and ſhall behold this perſon raiſed in his ſpirit, enlarged in his comforts, and enjoyments, with the World under his feet; the ſight of ſuch an example as this will provoke them alſo, to trample the World under their feet likewiſe. <hi>Your Zeal</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of their great forwardneſs and alacrity in contributing towards the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the poor Saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2.) <hi>hath provoked very many,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> in the ſame kind, to the like bounty and liberality.) And yet we know men are as hard, as unlikely to be <hi>provoked</hi> by examples in this kind (I mean, to part with their money) as by any other kind of example what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. In like manner, the zeal of any man in believing in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> being made viſible unto men, by ſuch deportments and actions, which can in reaſon, or in the judgment of conſcience have no other root to bear them but this; the zeal (I ſay) of ſuch a Believer may ſet the whole World on fire round about him, and <hi>provoke</hi> many to do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. <hi>Abraham</hi> may very probably be thought to have the ſpirit of this glory caſt upon him, to be ſtiled the Father of Believers, becauſe his notable Example was in the nature and proper tendency of it ſo genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſo apt and likely to repleniſh and fill the World with a generation of Believers.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1, brings <hi>a cloud of Witneſſes</hi> to this very end, unto thoſe to whom he writes; <hi>viz.</hi> to encourage, ſtrengthen, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to believing yet more and more, and to continue believing unto the end. So then this is one Reaſon, which plainly demonſtrates an Obligation lying upon every man to be a ſignal Benefactor unto the world; <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſtands obliged, by command from God, to believe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95016:38"/>in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and not only this, but to compel the World to know that he deth (indeed) thus believe. He that ſhall do this, ſhall lift up his hand on high to bleſs the Generation of the Sons and Daughters of men, amongſt whom he converſeth, and ſhall take a courſe to open a door unto them, to become the Sons and Daughters of God by believing likewiſe, and conſequently to become happy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever. And becauſe of this notable efficacy, and potent tendency which a man's Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> demonſtratively aſſerted by life and waies appropriate to it, hath to bleſs the World, by drawing men into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the ſame courſe of engagement with him, the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath (I conceive) impoſed it in the nature of a ſpiritual Aſſeſsment on every man and woman in the World that believeth, namely, that they make Profeſſion of this their Belief in the Face of the World; that ſo the World may be made to know, that they believe: yea, and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it in the ſame act, by which Salvation it ſelf is granted unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe in thy heart, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, becauſe Confeſſion is one way by which the Faith of men may be made known to the World, therefore doth he impoſe by way of Tax <hi>the Confeſſion of the mouth,</hi> his meaning is (as Expoſitors generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it) the whole life and converſation. <hi>He that believes and is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Here he joyns faith, or believing, and profeſſion together, and inſures Salvation upon both. Baptiſm, or to be baptized, in thoſe daies (eſpecially) was (as it were) the firſt born of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And therefore I take it to be an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is to be underſtood figuratively, or ſyneedochically, <hi>viz.</hi> for a ſolemn or ſerious Profeſſion of their Faith. <hi>He that believeth and is baptized,</hi> that is, he that believeth, and ſhall let the World know that he believeth, ſuch a man ſhall be ſaved. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32. <hi>He that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth me before men, him will I confeſs,</hi> &amp;c. So that we ſtill find, that upon mens Believing, or upon their Converſion, they have had ſome ſuch ſpiritual impoſition as this laid upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> to be helpful to others. <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy Brethreu;</hi> So behave thy ſelf, that this Converſion of thine may efficaciouſly tend unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, or Confirmation of others. And ſo <hi>David</hi> knew what his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was, what was impoſed upon him, when as God ſhould reſtore unto him <hi>the joy of his ſalvation:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 51 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall I teach tranſgreſſers the way, and ſinners ſhall be converted unto thee;</hi> As if he had ſaid, I know the task that is laid by the hand of the Righteouſneſs of Heaven upon me; namely, that recovering my ſelf again from my ſins, and receiving grace and favour from God, reſtoring me to my former enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I ſhould teach tranſgreſſors his way. This then is one reaſon to prove clearly that it lyeth upon every man and woman of us to be great and ſignal Benefactors to the World. Firſt, Becauſe we ſtand bound to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95016:38"/>believe in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Secondly, To make the world know that we do really and indeed thus believe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> There is yet another thing which is of ſome affinity with the former, yet not the ſame; which plainly evinceth the point in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> That every perſon of mankind, man and woman, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Generation of Believers, ſtand bound, according to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral capacities, means, and opportunities, to caſt liberally into the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of the World that which is likely and proper to enrich and bleſs it. This is the keeping the Commandments of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the tranſlating of all his Words, of all his Sayings and Precepts into Actions and Practice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the World. He that ſtands bound to do this, without all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, ſtandeth bound to be a moſt worthy Benefactor to the World by doing that, which is of a moſt bleſſed accommodation to it. Now, that we all ſtand bound to keep the Commandments of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and not to caſt the leaſt of them behind our backs, or tread them under our feet, is (I preſume) voted long ſince by all our conſciences with a <hi>Nemine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicente:</hi> and therefore we ſhall not ſtand to prove this. Now, that the performance of this great and worthy engagement, and the quitting our ſelves in it like men, is of a moſt ſoveraign import and tendency to bleſs the World; I ſhall nor need to go far, nor make any long work, to prove. The World may be ſaid to be bleſſed in two Conſiderations, or in two different degrees; Firſt, In the things of its preſent peace, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, In the things of its future and eternal peace. Now, That he that diligently and faithfully keepeth the Commandments of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Benefactor unto it in both, is a truth near at hand, and prepared (in a manner) with its own evidence, for every mans underſtanding and conſent.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That worthy thing we ſpeak of, the obeying <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in what he hath commanded, is matter of a rich and precious import to bleſs the World in the things of their preſent comfort and peace. And this in two reſpects (in the general) may be made clearly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By ſhewing that the very Acts themſelves of Conformity and Obedience unto the Laws and Commands of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are ſimply and in themſelves of a ſweet and beneficent nature, full of a ſpirit of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and comporting with the preſent peace and comfort of the World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By ſhewing that the exemplarineſs of ſuch Conformity, though exhibited and given by one ſingle perſon, or a very few at firſt, may in a ſhort time turn to a very good account for the further accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation and benefit of the World.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The whole Syſteme and Body of the Laws of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed with a moſt exquiſite and clear proportion, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> to the preſent benefit and comfort of the World: theſe have a beneficent nature in them, they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95016:39"/>are full of a ſpirit of goodneſs, inſomuch that were they all obſerved and kept on all hands, it would preſently turn the Waters of the World into Wine, it would change the Earth, which is now as a roaring Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, into an <hi>Eden,</hi> or Garden of God to the Inhabiters of it: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now the proſpect of the World, as it appeareth in the eyes of God, and Angels, and Men, is as of men taking one another by the throat, every man tearing out of anothers bowels or belly, to put into their own. Upon the ſuppoſition mentioned, the proſpect or face of it would be quite contrary: For then the World would ſeem, yea, and really be, quite another thing: Every man would be found, what <hi>Moſes</hi> was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aaron,</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 4.16.) inſtead of God unto another: There would be no Emulation, or Conteſt, between men, but only who in giving honour, and doing good, ſhould go before other. Our Saviour (<hi>Mat.</hi> 22, 37, 38.) reduceth the Law of God to theſe two heads: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy ſoul, with all thy ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And thy Neighbour as thy ſelf.</hi> Now, if theſe two general Laws were, in their due compaſs and extent, obſerved in the World, you would ſoon have a new Heaven, and a new Earth. If we could perſwade thoſe, who have Silver and Gold in abundance to miniſter with theſe unto the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of the poor and needy, and thoſe that have other things (though they want theſe) wherewith they may bleſs the World otherwiſe, to ſerve the occaſions of it accordingly, (as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John had neither Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nor Gold,</hi> Acts 3.6. yet they had wherewith they bleſſed men at a far better rate than thoſe who had moſt of theſe.) I ſay, if mens hearts were really and truly ſet within them to promote the welfare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of mankind with what they have available and conducing in any kind hereunto (which is nothing but what the Royal Law of <hi>Chriſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth at their hand) would not all tears be ſoon wiped away from the eyes of the world, and men on all hands be as thoſe that dream, or as if the Kingdom of God had prevented them, and come upon them unawares? <hi>Charge them that be rich in this world, that they be not high minded,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. If this one Precept of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> were but duly and conſcienciouſly practiced and obſerved from time to time, what a mighty change would there be made in the World by the means of it? How would the faces ſhine, which now through hunger and cold have gathered blackneſs? How would the voice of joy, and health, and thankſgiving, be heard in thoſe Habitations, which are now filled with ſighings, groanings, and lamentations? And ſo there is another Law of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which the Apoſtle calleth his (namely, <hi>Chriſt's</hi>) in an eſpecial manner. This is to <hi>bear one anothers burthens. Bear ye one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers burthens: and ſo fulfil the Law of Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 6.2. This alſo would make a great and happy change and alteration in the World, if perſons would but <hi>bear the burthens one of another.</hi> But what is it to <hi>bear the burthens one of another?</hi> I anſwer, When we do not make our ſelves
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95016:39"/>ſtrangers unto men, nor draw back our helping hand from them, nor refuſe to do them any office or ſervice of love, becauſe of ſuch and ſuch infirmities; as becauſe they are not ſo diſcreet or well-adviſed in ſome of their waies or doings, as they might have been; or becauſe either in a Paſſion, or through want of Conſideration, they have ſpake unkindly to us, or unworthily of us; or have acted ſomewhat to our prejudice in one kind or other, or the like. But men generally are ſo far from bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the burthens of others, that they throw them upon their necks, and make them bear them themſelves. For when becauſe of any weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or infirmities, which men are ſubject unto, or becauſe of any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteous behaviour in word, or deed, uſed towards us, we ſhall be at any greater diſtance from them, or ſhall be leſs kind or ſerviceable unto them, than otherwiſe we would be, in caſe no ſuch weakneſs were found upon them, or no ſuch unkindneſs had been done unto us; this is the caſting of mens burthens upon their own necks, and to reject the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by which we (our ſelves) ſtand charged to bear them. The Apoſtle in this injunction of <hi>hearing one another; burthens,</hi> ſeems to ſuppoſe, that even in men of the beſt temper, and moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious and Circumſpect in their lives and waies, there is ſomewhat, more or leſs, that is burthenſome, that is diſtaſteful, unpleaſing, and (in ſome degree) offenſive unto others. This notwithſtanding, if men would but fulfil the Law of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and cut Tallies one with another, every man gratifying other with bearing his burthens, the great Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of Mankind would be proſperous and happy, and little or no damage or inconvenience accrue unto it by the weakneſſes, or want of wiſdom, in the reſpective members of it: There would be the ſame, as full, as quick, an entercourſe and commerce of love, and of the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, as there would, or could be in caſe they were all perfect, and as ſo many Angels of God. Yea, (my Brethren) this bearing the burthens of one another, did we freely ſubmit unto it, and practice it, would turn to a very happy account ot us in another day. For God will not give greater rewards for any kind of works, or ſervice, than for bearing the burthens of men, eſpecially, the burthens of the Saints; and moſt of all for the bearing the burthens of <hi>Chriſt, (viz.)</hi> perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for righteouſneſs and a good conſcience ſake. We ſhall hardly find any of the Commands of God, or of <hi>jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but the keeping of them would turn to the peace and comfort of men: Theſe are they that in the very nature of them all, are apt to create peace and proſperity in the World; and the want of a diligent and faithful performance of them is that, that doth occaſion trouble between man and man, and maketh breaches upon their mutual Comforts. You can hardly break any of the Commands of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but you will make a breach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the peace of the World, you will fall foul one of another: But ſo long as you keep on in the waies of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Commands, you
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95016:40"/>comply and comport with the peace and comfort of the World round about you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> The very Example of a through Conformity and ſubjection to the Law of God muſt needs be of a very choice and high accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the World, beſides the nature and tendency of the actions themſelves. The very Example, though but of one ſingle perſon his Conformity to the Laws of God, may be of ſingular concernment to the World. Your <hi>Zeal</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) <hi>hath provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked many,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2. And (as the Scripture demandeth) <hi>a little fire how great a matter, or how great a wood,</hi> (for ſo it is in the original) how great a wood or foreſt of wood <hi>doth it kindle,</hi> or ſet on fire? So one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, one man, or woman, that doth clearly, and in the face of the World, walk in a through Conformity to the Law of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, tender, and circumſpect, and taketh all his Commands in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive ſeaſons, along with him in his courſe, may propagate a great Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Conformiſts in the ſame kind. For who knoweth how many trees of the Foreſt of this World may be ſet on fire by this Example? Men and Women (more generally) ſeem to look upon the Laws of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as if they were given to men only to hear, and ſpeak of, or at moſt to live by in another World; and ſo the neglect, or breach of them toucheth few mens Conſciences, makes no breach upon their peace. Whereas, if theſe Laws were but tranſlated into practice by fleſh and bloud, by men and women ſubject to like paſſions and infirmities with themſelves, this would beget other manner of thoughts in the hearts and conſciences of the World (generally) concerning them: Did men but ſeriouſly conſider it with themſelves, that if fleſh and bloud, men of the ſame nature, liable to the ſame tentations with themſelves, by the ſame means and aſſiſtance, both inward and outward, which are afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, can keep the Commandments of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and walk holily; they could not lightly but be convinced, that certainly the God of Heaven will look for it at their hands, that they go and do likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> He that ſhall diligently and faithfully keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the view and ſight of the World, muſt needs be a ſignal Benefactor unto it in the things of their Eternal peace, which are of a thouſand times greater conſequence than all the concernments of this life. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. Our Saviour in this paſſage clearly implies, that there is a proper tendency in mens good works to prevail with others to <hi>glorifie their Father which is in Heaven (viz.)</hi> by repenting and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in him, and living unto him, and this is a moſt bleſſed accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation unto the World. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh concerning the faithful behaviour of Servants towards their Maſters, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9, 10. telling them that by ſuch a carriage and behaviour, they <hi>ſhall adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</hi> Now (Brethren) What is the reaſon that the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95016:40"/>hearts of men are not drawn out more freely to the Doctrine of God and <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Why do mens hearts ſtand off, and make no more treaſure of it than they do? Doubtleſs one main reaſon hereof is, it wants adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and beautifying; it is not ſet forth before their eyes with that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to take the hearts of men, wherewith it might and ought to be. But who are they that do adorn this Doctrine, and conſequently, that commend it in the ſight of men, and make it a beautiful, lovely, and deſirable object unto them? They that deal by their Great Lord and Maſter <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as the Apoſtle would have other Servants to deal by theirs, <hi>viz.</hi> by being <hi>obedient unto them, and pleaſing them well in all things, Tit.</hi> 2.9. They that ſhall diligently and faithfully obſerve and keep the Commands of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they will adorn it, they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it with authority and power to the ſouls and conſciences of men. Such men when they ſhall but utter and aſſert the plain words of the Goſpel, when they ſhall ſay unto any man, or unto any numbers of men, that certainly <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is He: He is the Saviour of the World, and whoſoever cometh unto him ſhall be ſaved by him, or the like; ſuch perſons (I ſay) as theſe we ſpeak of, by ſuch plain and known words as theſe, are like to pierce and wound the hard hearts and conſciences of ſinful and unbelieving men: The words of God in the mouths of ſuch men are as <hi>Arrows in the hand of a Giant,</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.4) they pierce deep, and do execution afar off. Other men, that for matters appertaining unto God, are but like the reſt of the World, and have nothing ſingular in their lives and converſations, though uſing and uttering the ſame words with the former, are yet but as ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Braſs or tinkling Cymbals in compariſon of them. Yea, when men ſhall be found or known to be (as it were) rent, and torn, or broken in their obedience unto the Goſpel, (alas) they know, or may know, that when they ſhall preach the Doctrine of Faith, Repentance, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the like, men will have wherewith to anſwer all that ſhall be ſpoken unto them by ſuch men, from their own mouths. For who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards words and ſayings, where actions and works are of a contrary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port? As he that ſpeaks Contradictions, one while affirming one thing, and at another time the quite contrary, this man edifies no man by ſuch a kind of diſcourſe, no man can tell whether he ſpeaketh truth in the former Propoſition, or whether in the latter, and ſo they go away as if nothing had been ſpoken: they who ſpeak at no better a rare, deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſaying with the other. In like manner, they, whoſe lives and actions riſe up againſt their teachings or ſpeakings, are of kin to thoſe <hi>dumb Dogs</hi> of which the Scripture ſpeaks, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.10.) For what they teach or affirm in words, they deny in works, and ſo in effect teach no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. The reaſon why <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to have taught with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not as the Scribes and Phariſees, is given by ſome to be this, (and I conceive it very pertinent) <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he did what he ſaid and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95016:41"/>taught, and they ſaid and did not. So when they that keep the holy Commandment, and walk up to the Rule of the Goſpel, ſhall teach, admoniſh, and inſtruct, they ſhall do it with power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; the Conſcience and Judgments of men will give them reverence and do homage unto them. As it is ſaid of <hi>Herod,</hi> that he feared <hi>John,</hi> knowing that he was a juſt man and an holy, and obſerved him, and when he heard him, he did <hi>many things, Mar.</hi> 6.20. And our Saviour taketh notice elſe-where of his righteouſneſs and holy life, as making his Doctrine much more commendable, and of force upon the Conſciences of men, and withal chargeth ſuch perſons very high who did not embrace and ſubmit unto his Doctrine: <hi>John</hi> (faith he) <hi>came unto you in a way of righteouſneſs, and yet you believed him not,</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 21.32.) as who ſhould ſay, You declared your ſelves a <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vipers,</hi> indeed, when as having ſuch a man as <hi>John</hi> come among you, a perſon ſo innocent and holy, that you could lay nothing to his charge, yet you reject his Doctrine, you believe him not; which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the light of Reaſon, and argues a prepoſterous and perverſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, frowardly bent againſt the Truth. So that if men be not of this Generation, men of a viperous ſpirit, and deſperately ſet upon their own ruine and deſtruction; it cannot lightly be, but the Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the mouthes of juſt and holy men, will do great execution upon them, and make the powers of ſin and darkneſs to fly before it. Thus we have made good that in the Reaſon given, which was ſuppoſed, being this, That every man ſtandeth bound in duty towards God, to act the part of a worthy Benefactor unto the World round about him, and as far as in him lieth, to bleſs his Generation.</p>
               <p>The other thing which is affirmed in the Reaſon, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> was, That no man or woman can be in any good or (indeed) tolerable capacity to diſcharge this Obligation, unleſs they be <hi>filled with the Spirit of God.</hi> And this we have in part made good already in what was delivered in opening the former Reaſon. There we ſhewed, That men and women will never do any great, any ſingular thing for God and the intereſt of the Goſpel, unleſs they take a regular and due courſe to be <hi>filled with the Spirit.</hi> There is the ſame conſideration of doing great things for the World: Men and women will fall extremely ſhort of their duty herein alſo, and with-hold that from the World which is its due, unleſs they take an effectual courſe to ſtrengthen their hand, and their heart, to the work, which muſt be by <hi>filling</hi> themſelves <hi>with the Spirit of God.</hi> For as they, who give munificently and like Princes, had need be Princes, or at leaſt have the the Eſtate and Revenues of Princes: So ſuch men and women who ſhall caſt in any thing conſiderable into the Treaſury of the World, to cover the nakedneſs, and feed the hunger, and heal the poverty of it, had need be full of the Divine Nature, and have a ſpecial Magazine within them of Faith and Love, of Wiſdom and Knowledge, of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95016:41"/>Patience and Humility, of Mortification, and elf-denial, and many other heavenly endowments: Otherwiſe they ſhall never be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce over mankind, to do it much good, nor to <hi>ſow liberally</hi> and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully unto it. As the Lord <hi>Chriſt;</hi> had he not been <hi>Rich</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle faith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9.) the making of himſelf <hi>Poor</hi> would not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the making of many <hi>Rich;</hi> ſo in caſe that a perſon hath but a little inward worth in him, if he be ſcanted in true excellency and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of ſpirit, though he ſhould empty and pour out himſelf to the World, the poverty of it is ſuch, and the neceſſity of it ſo extreme craving, and ſo devouring above meaſure; that ſuch an eſtate would do little more towards the relief of it, than the <hi>ſeven fat Kine</hi> in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> dream did toward the <hi>ſeven that were lean</hi> and ill favoured; the Text faith, when they had devoured them, they were not ſeen upon them, but they were as lean and ſtarven, and as evil favoured as before; the fat had need (it ſeems) to have been ſeven and ſeven, and twenty times ſeven times fatter than they were, to have wrought a Cure upon the leanneſs and hard-favouredneſs of the other. And as <hi>Andrew (Simon Peters Brother)</hi> informed <hi>Chriſt</hi> of a Lad that had <hi>five barly loaves and two ſmall fiſhes, but viewing the multitude that were to be fed, demanded, but <hi>what are they amongſt ſo many?</hi> Joh. 6.9. And the truth is, without the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous interpoſure of a Divine Power for their multiplication, they had been very little (indeed) amongſt the multitude, that was to be relieved by them: In like manner, he that ſhall diligently conſider, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, not ſo much the numberleſs multitude of ſouls, or of men and women, in the World round about him, as the numberleſs multitude of their ſpiritual neceſſities, and thoſe very ſad, and threatning with open mouth eternal ruine and deſtruction on every ſide, cannot lightly but confeſs upon the view, that he, that ſhall miniſter unto them with any likelihood of recovering them to any degree of health, and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, had need be one of a thouſand (as the preſent ſtature and conſtitution of the World generally now is:) I mean, had need be a perſon as like unto an Angel of God, as fleſh and bloud is capable of the aſſimilation, a perſon ſo deeply baptized into the hope of life and immortality, ſo acted and carried out of himſelf by the Spirit of the World to come, that he hath left the know ledge both of perſons and of things <hi>after the fleſh,</hi> and knoweth nothing, neither the one nor the other, but according to the Spirit only, that is, how they relate unto the honour and glory of God, and how they may be made ſerviceable unto the peace and comfort of men. The Apoſtles being made by the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> Feoffees</hi> in truſt for the World, in the managing and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the invaluable Treaſure of the Goſpel to the beſt profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for the Inhabitants of it, yet as concerning the preaching of this Goſpel, were directed by him to ſtay at <hi>Jeruſalem, untill they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſtrength from on high,</hi> untill they were baptized with the Holy
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:95016:42"/>Ghoſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. The reaſon hereof was, leaſt, in caſe they ſhould go forth into the World no better provided with Wiſdom, Knowledge, Faith, and Courage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than they were at preſent, and before the golden ſhower had rained upon them; the work and ſervice they had to do for the World in preaching to Goſpel and otherwiſe, would have been found too hard for them, and to overcharge them, and have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them as <hi>New wine in old bottles,</hi> which by reaſon of the ſtrength and high working of the Spirit of it, it being yet <hi>new,</hi> is like to <hi>rent and break them in peices,</hi> and ſo to make both them and it ſelf uſeleſs. And indeed men had need be endued with ſtrength and power from on high, to do ſuch things as will reach the neceſſities of the World with any likelihood to relieve them. For theſe (the neceſſities of the World) are very many, and ſome of them very great, and hard, and difficult to come at; yea, there is nothing more difficult than to make the men themſelves willing to receive a Cure. Therefore he upon whoſe hand it lyeth to relieve the deep poverty of the World (as it lyeth upon all our hands to bear a part, and this as large as may be in ſo great and bleſſed a work) had need be endued with ſpecial ſtrength and power from on high. And what is this but to be <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> theſe being deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to let the World know, and cauſe men to underſtand he was their Meſſiah, without which knowledge he could not bleſs them; this (I ſay) being his deſign, and deſire, he was neceſſitated, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>to do ſuch things</hi> among them <hi>which no man ever did,</hi> nor (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) could do, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.24. otherwiſe they had been in no capacity of receiving any benefit or ſoul-accommodation by his heavenly Doctrine, nor by any work that he ſhould have done among them, unleſs they had had this diſtinguiſhing and peculiar Character, whereby to have been known from all the works in the World beſides, and that they were ſuch that no other man could do. For if they had been no other than what others could do as well as he, it is like they would have proved but like to the former works of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which wrought not at all upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> becauſe <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sorcerers, did the like:</hi> whilſt their hand held out with <hi>Moſes</hi> all that he did was to no purpoſe, as to any conviction upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or his people, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſent by God. The <hi>Sorcerers,</hi> by doing things like unto thoſe which <hi>Moſes</hi> did, are ſaid to <hi>have reſiſted,</hi> or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8. (<hi>viz.</hi> in his attempt and endeavours, by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, to convince <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that he was ſent unto him by God to require of him the diſmiſſion of his People out of his Land.) For as long as his <hi>Inchanters</hi> were able to vie Miracles with <hi>Moſes</hi> (at leaſt as name of God. But now when <hi>Moſes</hi> came to do ſuch works, which neither <hi>Jannes,</hi> nor <hi>Jambres,</hi> nor their Maſter himſelf (the Devil) could
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:95016:42"/>do, nor any like to them, then <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his <hi>Aegyptians</hi> began to look about them; and the Magicians themſelves acknowledged in theſe the finger of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.19. So if we intend to bleſs the World, or do any great things for our Generation, ſo long as our waies, and courſe, and Spirit that works in us, are but like the waies and ſpirits of other men, that do not declare ſtoutly and aloud for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> whoſe live and doings have no peculiar relation to him; ſo long (I ſay) as we go but their pace, and act at their rate, alas! the World will deſpiſe us, and all our ſayings and doings. For whilſt natural and carnal mens works will hold out with the works of Profeſſors, all this while the World ſtirs not, but keeps its wonted poſture of ſecurity and obdurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: whilſt thoſe that pretend to Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhall not riſe up in Acts of Chriſtianity above the Line and Level of all that can be done by any other hand or ſpirit whatſoever, (but only that ſame moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit of Faith) all this while they miniſter little or nothing to the neceſſities of the World. My Brethren, our arrows will fall ſhort of the mark, and we ſhall do little more than beat the air: if we think to do any worthy ſervice unto the World, unleſs we ſhall quit our ſelves as a <hi>peculiar People, a Royal Prieſthood, and a choſen Generation.</hi> We muſt be a Generation by our ſelves, and in all heavenly worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency above the World, before we can have any power over it to work and faſhion it into any ſhape or form that God may take pleaſure in. And if we ſhall do works diſtinguiſhed by a Character of ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and beauty in them, like unto which there is none found amongſt the Children of men, (excepting ſuch who are eminently the Children of God alſo) this is that which will reach the World, and make the foundations of the unbelief and wickedneſs thereof to quake and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Then, and not till then, are we like to ſtand the World in ſome conſiderable ſtead. but conſider we a little the particular in hand: We gave inſtance of three things (in general) which all perſons ſtand bound to do, and by the performance whereof they ſhall approve themſelves ſignal Benefactors to the World, and occaſion many to ſay unto them theſe, or like words; <hi>Bleſſed are the Wombs that bare you, and the Paps that gave you ſuck.</hi> The firſt was. to believe with the <hi>Centuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> Faith, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 8.10.) I mean, with a Faith ſo great, that there is none to be found like unto it, no not in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to believe above the Faith of ordinary Believers. Yea, (doubtleſs) it is the duty of every ſoul of us, to believe above the preſent degree of the Faith of the greateſt and beſt reſolved Believers amongſt the Children of men. The ſecond thing was this; to diſplay, manage, and act this Faith before the World, that they may ſee it (as it were) face to face; and that the fruit, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, teſtimony, and account of it, may be fully adaequate and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurable to the truth, and all the degrees of the reality of it. The third (and laſt) thing, whereunto all men ſtand bound, and by the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95016:43"/>performance whereof they muſt needs bleſs the World, was the keeping of the Commands of God. How, and in what reſpects, the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all theſe muſt needs ſtand the World in eminent ſtead, was ſhewed formerly: We have now only to ſhew, how they cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without their being <hi>filled with the Spirit of God</hi> who ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> For that notable ſtrain, and generous kind of believing we ſpake of: As no Faith, no kind, or degree of believing can be attained or raiſed in the ſoul, but by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſo much leſs can any excellent or worthy ſtrain hereof be raiſed or exerted in men, but by the glorious might of the ſame <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Doubtleſs, there is no man believeth upon any other terms, than thoſe did, who are ſaid (<hi>Acts</hi> 18.27.) to have <hi>believed through grace,</hi> that is, through the gracious operation and aſſiſtance of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> So likewiſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Seeing you have purified your hearts,</hi> (or ſouls) <hi>in obeying the Truth through the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. implying, that neither had they obeyed the truth (meaning the Goſpel) that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it (the Goſpel being there, under the notion of truth, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, made the Object of Faith) had not the Spirit of God done ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry graciouſly by them in awaking and exciting them hereunto: They would never in any ſerious manner, have ſo much as though upon this believing, had not the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> put them upon it. The Goſpel, and mens hearts are commonly ſtrangers: the World, and their ſenſuality, and folly, make them ſo. They have little knowledge one of another, and (doubtleſs) would never have been brought together but by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of that moſt gracious and bleſſed Spirit. Now the Spirit of God bringeth the hearts of men, and the Goſpel together, by cauſing a kind of enterview to be between them for a while, upon which if there be not an extream frowardneſs, and deſperateneſs of folly in the hearts of men, the glory and beauty of the things to be believed, being preſented unto them by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> will overcome them, and ſo there will follow a bleſſed union and agreement between them. Now, as the firſt and loweſt greeting, between the Souls and conſciences of men and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, was procured by the ſimple interpoſure of the Spirit of God; ſo muſt that glorious and more near interview between them, which we call face to face, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch a Faith which giveth preſentiality, or real ſubſiſtence unto the great things of the Goſpel in the ſpirits and ſouls of men (which alone is the Faith that will bleſs the World, by amazing it with its glory breaking forth in ſemblable actions) this (ſay we) muſt be obtained not ſimply by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> but by him in his more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and raiſed actings, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.14, 16. <hi>For this cauſe</hi> (faith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>bow I my knees to the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of whom the whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named, that he would grant you, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of his glory, to be ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit in the inward man,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle travelling in birth with a great
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:95016:43"/>matter of grace and ſpiritual bleſſing, for this people and Church of God, he telleth them, he <hi>bowed his knees to the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of whom the whole Family in Heaven and Earth is named,</hi> &amp;c. meaning by this Character and Conſideration, that he is the Root of all that Family that is worthy to be put into account, that is, of all that are holy and righteous where ever they be, and that they take their denomination, as well as their ſpiritual and happy being, from him. But for what did he <hi>bow his knees to the Father of,</hi> &amp;c? It was, <hi>That he would grant them, according to the riches of his glory</hi> (ſee how he laboureth and toyleth to be delivered of what he had conceived to ask of God for them) <hi>to be ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. But why doth he inſert this clauſe, <hi>according to the riches of his glory?</hi> Doubtleſs, his meaning is, to inform them, that though the requeſt, which he was now making unto God for them, was exceeding great (<hi>viz.</hi> that they might be <hi>ſtrengthened with might by his Spirit,</hi> &amp;c.) yet there was good ground of hope that he ſhould obtain it, becauſe the grant of it was, but <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of his glory,</hi> that is, proportionable or ſutable to that glorious abundance of Grace, Love, Bounty, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which reſide in him, and are his Glory. So that he knew that God could very well afford it, notwithſtanding the greatneſs of it, being ſo richly furniſhed with all things neceſſary for the performance of it. So that it is, as if he had ſaid, I know it were in vain for me to <hi>how my knees</hi> to God for any ſuch benefit for you, as your <hi>ſtrengthening with might by his Spirit,</hi> did not I know he is exceeding rich in Glory, in Bounty, in Grace, in Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore in this you may be comforted, that I do not beg this heavenly bread for you out of any deſolate place, or at ſuch a hand where it was not to be had; or from any ſuch heart, which is ſhut up againſt you: no, but from him, who is both able, and willing to give unto all that ask, <hi>Good meaſure, heaped up, preſſed down, and running over,</hi> Luke 6.8. Yea, and this in things of greateſt conſequence and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, well knowing that it is his glory thus to do. Now to be <hi>ſtrengthened with might in the inner man</hi> ſignifies more than ſimply to believe: Yea, more than ſimply to be ſtrengthened in, or by believing; it imports a powerful ſtrengthening, or an excellent and high degree of corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſtoutneſs, in their ſpirits, hearts, and ſouls; by means whereof they ſhould be able both to do, and to ſuffer, and this without much regret, or trouble, greater things for God, and for the Goſpel, than the common ſort of Believers can. But why doth pray, that this migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtrengthening in the inner man might be wrought by the Spirit? I anſwer, Becauſe it is the appropriate work of the Spirit, thus to elevate and raiſe the hearts and ſpirits of men above fears and doubtings; God never conferring this high Priviledge upon Believers themſelves without his interpoſure. And beſides, it is conſiderable, that it is the manner of the Saints throughout the Scriptures (and ſo it was obſerved by <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:95016:44"/>himſelf in his Prayer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11, 17, 19, 20. that whenever they make any great requeſt unto God, they do not ſimply mention, or inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what they deſire; but they deſire it in Gods way, and by that means by which they knew God was wont or likely to confer it. Thus when <hi>Chriſt</hi> prayed for the Sanctification of his Apoſtles, he prayed not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that God would <hi>ſanctifie them,</hi> but that he would <hi>ſanctifie them by his truth;</hi> becauſe he knew that, that was Gods ſtanding way and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, by which he was wont to ſanctifie men. So the Apoſtle here knowing that God would not do that great thing, for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> which he prayed for on their behalf (<hi>viz.</hi> that they <hi>might be ſtrengthened with might in their inner man,</hi> be made glorious in their Faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve like Princes) but by the interpoſure of his ſpirit, He frameth his prayer for it accordingly. And this is further to be conſidered, that to be <hi>ſtrengthened with might in the inner man,</hi> (ſuppoſeth that the Spirit of God muſt advance above his ordinary degree of acting to effect it: He muſt not only act or interpoſe, in men to work it, but at ſuch a rate of energy and power, which is proportionable to ſuch an effect. And that is another Rule to be minded: when any thing is preſcribed, or menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, by way of means in order to ſuch or ſuch an end, though the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the means be not expreſſed; yet it is to be eſtimated and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by the nature and quality of the end, to be obtained thereby. But we have not time to ſtand upon this. So that the Apoſtle (we ſee) plainly ſuppoſeth this, that there is no <hi>ſtrengthening with might in the inner man,</hi> which in plain Engliſh is, that there is no believing, at any high rate, but by the interpoſure of the Spirit; yea, and of ſuch an interpoſure, wherein he muſt give out himſelf at another manner of rate, than it is requiſite that he ſhould do in making men ſimply to believe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> Concerning the ſecond particular, which was, when this Faith doth triumph in the ſoul, when a man is full of the glory and power of it, to give an adaequate and Commenſurable account of it, to ſhew men this Faith in its juſt magnitude by works; and not ſimply ſo, but by ſuch a Syſteme of works, ſuch a conſtant tenour of Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which according to the interpretation of a man, comparing Cauſes with effects, it may be rationally ſaid, that ſuch a ſeries of actions, ſuch a ſtrain of life and converſation, cannot proceed from, cannot call any other Faith, or Belief, Father, or Mother, but only ſuch a Faith, which lifts up its head unto the Heavens. For unleſs ſuch a thing as this be done we ſhall not fill up the deep pit of the poverty of the World, nor repair the ſad breaches which ignorance, ſecurity, and unbelief have made upon the ſafety of it. For this is the caſe of the World (as before was ſignified) it is very low, the vanity, ſloathfulneſs and folly of it have brought it to a morſel of bread. Now, as when the viſive faculty, or ſight, is dim, or any waies maimed, or weak, the object had need be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:95016:44"/>very viſible, or to have many degrees of viſibility or lightſomneſs in it, to produce, or cauſe an Act of Senſation: In like manner the capacity and principle, in the World, whereby it is in any degree apprehenſive, or ſenſible of the things of its own recovery, welfare, and peace, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, ſcant, and low, they who deſire to work effectually upon it, and make it ſerviceable unto the World notwithſtanding, muſt preſent it with ſuch things, which are very notorious, and next to miraculous in their awakening, effecting, and reſtoring property. Or as when the ſtone or wood is hard, or very reſiſtive againſt the inciſſion, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that is deſired to be made upon it, the Tool or Inſtrument uſed for this purpoſe had need be ſharp and keen: So the temper of the World being very obdurate, and ſtubborn againſt ſuch impreſſions, that are like to benefit and accommodate them in their miſerable condition, that which is any waies probable, or hopeful to work a cure upon them, or to bring them to an effectual and lively remembrance of themſelves, muſt have ſo much the more of the Spirit, and of the life, of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and power of Faith in it. Therefore if mens waies, and works, ſhall be but low, and ordinary, and but level with thoſe of the common ſort of men in the World; yea, if they ſhall not be much above them, and magnifie themſelves beyond them (though it were ſuppoſed that the Faith of the perſons we ſpeak of, were very Royal, and Prince-like) yet will they not come at the World, nor reach the obdurate Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and beſotted Judgments of men by the mediation or interpoſure of ſuch works and waies. The Faith which is in men, though it be of never ſo large a growth and ſtature, yet will it not reach the ſore and ſad malady of the World; but only by an outſtretched arm of Works. For let me ſay this, (though (haply) the thing may ſeem otherwiſe unto you) that a mans works do not alwaies hold out weight and meaſure with his Faith, nor are the greateſt Believers alwaies the greateſt Doers. A full fountain (indeed) alwaies ſends forth a ſtream of water anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the fulneſs of it: But this is becauſe a fountain is a natural cauſe, and ſo alwaies gives out it ſelf to the uttermoſt of its power; whereas a Believer being a voluntary Agent, may moderate and temper himſelf as he pleaſeth, in the exerciſe of thoſe principles, out of which he acteth. Hence it cometh to paſs, that ſome men though they be large in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, yet are they ſtrait in giving teſtimony to their own Faith. We know many have the gift of wiſdom, who have not the gift of utterance; many that are very excellent in wiſdom and deep in underſtanding, yet they are flow of utterance, and ſo under a great diſadvantage to get forth their wiſdom. so many having an excellent and a glorious work of Faith, yet may they ſuffer through an ineptitude, or backwardneſs of ſpirit to aſſert that high degree of Faith by Works proportionable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, or any waies competent to evince what manner of Faith it is that reigneth. The frequent and fervent exhortations unto good works,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95016:45"/>and fruitfulneſs in well-doing, given by the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, and by his Apoſtles, unto Believers, ſufficiently prove, that the Faith of men doth not neceſſarily, or alwaies, give out its ſtrength in good works. For what need he to preſs and importune men to ſuch things, which they cannot refrain, or forbear, whether they be perſwaded or preſſed unto them or no? Yea, perſwaſions and exhortations are moſt proper (if not only proper) where there is ſome degree (at leaſt) of a backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or indiſpoſition unto the things exhorted, or perſwaded unto, in thoſe, who are perſwaded and exhorted unto them. When the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writeth thus to <hi>Titus,</hi> (<hi>Tit.</hi> 3.14.) <hi>And let ours alſo learn to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good works for neceſſary uſes, that they be not unfruitful;</hi> he clearly ſuppoſeth, that they who truly believe in God, are in danger, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Faith, of being unfruitful: and that to maintain the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and neceſſity of good works by an exemplarineſs in the practice of them, requireth a peculiar ſtrain of wiſdom and care, over and beſides a mans believing. But this only by the way, to ſhew that mens Works do not alwaies keep pace with their Faith, but are very frequently much behind it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> There is the ſame conſideration of the third thing mentioned, which is, the keeping of the Commands of God. If we do this, we ſhall do ſomething like unto the Children of God, and worthy the heirs Apparent of Heaven, and of the glory of the world to come. And (indeed) it becomes theſe to quit themſelves like Princes in the World; and to be Soveraign Benefactors to the Community of men. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they called the Sons of God, more than other men, if they be not like unto god in bleſſing the World in their capacity, as he doth in his? And yet neither ſhall they be in any capacity for this ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a work or imployment (I mean to bleſs the World by keeping the Commands of God) unleſs they <hi>be filled with the Spirit of God.</hi> For (my Brethren) the Commands of God, and ſo of <hi>Chriſt</hi> (we know) are ſpiritual: <hi>The Law,</hi> faith the Apoſtle, <hi>is ſpiritual, Rom.</hi> 7.14. and Believers themſelves, even they that believe in the higheſt, the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thieſt Believers under Heaven are carnal in a very great meaſure; whileſt they carry about them the body of fleſh, that will ſtill be importuning them to take care and make proviſion for it, yea, for the inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and luſts of it in ſeveral kinds. It will ever and anon be putting, even the beſt men, upon projecting and contriving its gratification, in this pleaſure and in that, in this enjoyment and in that, without end. As the dunghil ſendeth forth noyſome and offenſive vapours and ſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches continually: So the Fleſh all the day long ceaſeth nor to breath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, in many unſavoury, fooliſh, troubleſome, and importune ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions and motions ſtill <hi>luſting</hi> (as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it) <hi>againſt the Spirit.</hi> And (doubtleſs) it was an obnoxiouſneſs in this kind, that drew from him that ſad complaint, not only of his being <hi>carnal,</hi> but
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95016:45"/>even <hi>ſold under ſin, Rom.</hi> 7.14 (meaning that he was a man ſeldom free from ſome ſinful inſinuations or other from his fleſh) yea, and that pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical lamentation alſo, <hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> Ver. 24. Now theſe continual workings and movings of the fleſh, are of a ſtrong antipathy againſt, and next to an utter inconſiſtency with the keeping of the Commands of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For (as we lately heard) <hi>it luſteth againſt the Spirit,</hi> and ſo fighteth againſt the ſoul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. And therefore the Apoſtle himſelf was fain to take order with his body, <hi>to keep it under,</hi> and teach it ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (to the Spirit and Word of God) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. So we ſhould nurture it likewiſe, and teach it to demand, and require of us only things that are regular, and agreeable to the mind of God, and to be content with things that are requiſite, needful, and comely for it. And if the Fleſh would but contain it ſelf within this compaſs, and not exceed in craving, and deſiring the bounds of that Law which God hath preſcribed unto it, it would not much interrupt us in our courſe of obedience unto <hi>Chriſt:</hi> But now there is no mans fleſh ſo well taught or nurtured, or brought into any ſuch ſubjection, but that it will be importuning him for things that are inconvenient, and be unreaſonable in its motions, as it alwaies is, when it luſteth againſt the Spirit. Sometimes, and in ſome things, it luſteth with the Spirit, as when it requires (I mean [or doth] with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impatience, or frowardneſs) only ſuch things as are convenient and meet for it; as ſuch meats and drinks, ſuch cloathing and harbour, ſuch reſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is for the ſupport of it, and without which, the health and ſtrength, and ſerviceable activity and vigour of it cannot, in a natural or ordinary way, be maintained: All this while it luſteth with the Spirit; for the Spirit demands and requires ſuch things of us for the fleſh and outward man. But now for the moſt part it luſteth againſt the Spirit, as in ſeeking to be gratified in things contrary to the Spirit and the dictates hereof, to thoſe Laws of holineſs and righteouſneſs, which God himſelf hath judged meet to preſcribe unto it. So that unleſs we be in a great meaſure ſpiritual, (which muſt be by being <hi>filled with the Spirit of God</hi>) certain it is, we ſhall ever and anon faulter, and be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the courſe of our obedience, and not carry on the great deſign of obſerving the Commands of God, with that throughneſs, with that evenneſs of tenour, with that authority, life and power, which are very requiſite and neceſſary to be found in thoſe, whoſe worth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have ingaged them to attempt the Bleſſing of the World. For if there ſhall be any breaches and empty places found in our obedience, if we ſhall ever and anon fall foul upon any of the more remarkable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> alas, we ſhall endanger the repute and worth of the goodneſs of thoſe other things, wherein we ſhall obey, and walk re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly; they will loſe much of their virtue and authority in the hearts and conſciences of men, if they ſhall be mated and coupled with actions
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95016:46"/>and practices that are ignoble and baſe; yea, though it be but with omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and neglects of ſuch duties, which the World knows we ſtand bound to perform, as well as thoſe which we do in their ſight. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is an eminent and clear neceſſity for the interpoſure of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, both to enable, and make us willing, to nurture and keep under the fleſh, that it moves orderly and regularly, ſo as not to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome unto us with craving any thing that is ſinful and inordinate, or which intrencheth upon the glory of God, and honour of the great Law-giver <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or at leaſt to make us reſolute and peremptory to reject with indignation, all diſhonourable and unſeemly motions, that it ſhall make unto us, and to hearken unto it in nothing, in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion whereunto any of our great intereſts, or ſpiritual concernments are like to ſuffer in the leaſt. Even this is an high and holy priviledge, and not to be obtained or enjoyed by men without the high exertions and workings of the Spirit of God in them. And by the careful and conſtant exerciſe and uſe hereof, we ſpin ſuch an even and ſtrong thread of obedience to the Commands of God, whereby we ſhall be able to draw the world unto him. For as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid long ſince unto the <hi>Jews,</hi> (<hi>Joh.</hi> 4.48.) <hi>Except ye ſee ſigns and wonders, ye will not believe.</hi> So the truth is, that men generally will never look into their hearts, nor reflect ſeriouſly, or to any purpoſe, upon themſelves till they be ſome way or other amuſed and ſtruck with admiration. If we ſhall not reduce the World to ſome ſuch paſs as to marvel, and to wonder, and to think ſtrange of us, what manner of perſons we are, or what we mean, or whence we have our Principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſhall never come at the dull hearts, and at the ſleepy Conſciences of worldly and carnal men; They muſt <hi>ſee ſigns and wonders</hi> of Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs, and Humility, Love, Patience, Meekneſs, and other like <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Vertues, whereof they are capable: Otherwiſe they will think themſelves excuſable in their not believing. So then this is a third reaſon of the Doctrine, Without <hi>being filled with the Spirit,</hi> we are never like to be any great Benefactors to the World.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> The fourth Reaſon of the Doctrine propounded, and argued: Men are not capable of receiving the rich Conſolations of the Goſpel, unleſs they be filled with the Spirit, <hi>1 Pet. 2.9.</hi> in part open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So <hi>Heb. 6.17, 18. Eph. 3.17, 19. 1 Pet. 1.8. Eph. 1.18. Jam. 2.13. Prov. 19.16. Acts 17.28. Mar. 4.5. and 6.16.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>The fourth Reaſon: It is therefore a duty lying upon every man and woman (eſpecially upon thoſe who pretend to the honour of the high Calling of Saints) to <hi>be filled with the Spirit of God,</hi> becauſe otherwiſe they will be in no capacity to receive from the hand of God, and to be filled with thoſe rich and ſtrong Conſolations, during their abode here in the World, which God hath provided for them in the Goſpel: And which he will actually confer upon all thoſe that ſhall be found meet to receive them. In this reaſon (as in the former) we ſuppoſe one thing and, affirm another. The thing we ſuppoſe and take for granted, as not queſtioning the truth of it: Yet for the ſatisfaction of thoſe, who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may queſtion it, we ſhall a little put to the conſideration. The thing is this (I mean that which the reaſon ſuppoſeth) <hi>viz.</hi> That it is every mans duty, and more eſpecially every Believers, to deſire and ſeek after part and fellowſhip, not only in the Conſolations of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, but in the higheſt and richeſt Conſolations which the Goſpel admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtreth, or which are attainable by means of it: Upon what account this is, or may be, a duty, will appear preſently by inquiring into it. But that which we affirm in the Reaſon, is this, That without <hi>being filled with the Spirit of God,</hi> we are not meet Subjects, nor Veſſels regularly prepared to be filled with the ſtrong and excellent Conſolations of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>For the former of theſe (the thing ſuppoſed) That it is every mans duty, and more eſpecially, the duty of all that look upon themſelves, or are looked upon by others, as Believers, to thirſt after the ſweeteſt and richeſt waters of life, that the heavenly Fountain the Goſpel, from any place or vent of it, one, or more, ſendeth forth; and to break through all impediments, all difficulties, to come at them, is evident enough upon this ground, <hi>viz.</hi> That we all ſtand bound to declare and teſtifie unto the World, and this as well by deeds, or real demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as by words, or verbal account or aſſertion, the unſearchable riches of the grace, and great bountifulneſs of God towards the Children of men, in this preſent world, as well as in that which is to come, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95016:47"/>
                  <hi>But we are a choſen Generation, a Royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People;</hi> Why all this? <hi>To ſhew forth the praiſes,</hi> or vertues, or (as the Etymology of the word imports) the pleaſing or lovely things of him <hi>who hath called you out of darkneſs, into his marvelous light,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That you may ſhew forth,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the word ſignifies to ſpeak out, or declare aloud, ſo that all may hear that your ſound may go forth into all the World. Now when he minds them, that they are <hi>a choſen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, a Royal Prieſthood,</hi> &amp;c. that they ſhould throughly, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, <hi>ſhew forth the vertues of God,</hi>  He plainly ſheweth that it was Gods intent in honouring and enabling them, in making them Kings, and Prieſts, and Princes, by the Goſpel, to put them into a way or capacity of informing the World, upon terms of the beſt advantage (as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which ſignifieth to ſhew, or declare out, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) to make known unto the World what manner of God he is, how abounding in all excellent, deſirable, and delightful properties, and diſpoſitions, and with whatever elſe is likely to commend him, and his ſervice, and waies unto his Creatures the Children of men. Now, if God deſires ſuch a thing as this, caſting ſuch a Spirit of Glory upon men by the Goſpel, in making them a ſeparate and choice people, that they ſhould thus publiſh and proclaim all that which is excellent and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in him, certainly it is their duty to do it, and this upon the moſt worthy terms they know how; and conſequently, to enlarge their Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the utmoſt, that they may do it effectually, that they may do it with authority and power: Yea, if it be poſſible, to the aſtoniſhment and holy amazement of the World round about them. This certainly is the duty of men, to contrive and caſt about, how they may recover or gain the beſt ground of advantage, for the performance of ſuch a ſervice, as this is, unto God. So then this is that, which we ſaid, that all that claim the dignity of Saintſhip (eſpecially) ſtand bound by vertue of this claim, above other men, to ſteer ſuch a courſe, to uſe ſuch means, that they may be Children of the richeſt and moſt glorious Conſolations of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, becauſe otherwiſe they will ſtand upon a lower, and leſs advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ground for the ſervice; they will be but in an under capacity to make known unto the World <hi>the things that God hath prepared for them that love him;</hi> they will not be able to publiſh them without ſome detriment and loſs of their tranſcendent worth and excellency: which inconvenience they might, in a great meaſure at leaſt, have prevented by the courſe mentioned.</p>
               <p>For firſt, the Conſolations adminiſtred by the Goſpel, take them in their height, and ſtrength, where they riſe higheſt, they are very glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, unſpeakably glorious. Secondly, Such perſons, who do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke and ſtir up themſelves mightily, that do not lift up their hearts to ſuch means which are proper to obtain them, are not likely to obtain them. Thirdly (and laſtly) they that are not poſſeſſed of them, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95016:47"/>do not enjoy them, are in no better poſture <hi>to ſhew forth the vertues,</hi> or lovely things of God, like themſelves, and as they might, and ought to ſhew them, than <hi>Zatheus,</hi> by reaſon of the Iowneſs of his ſtature, was to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a great throng and preſs of people, until he climed up into the Sycamore tree, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.3. So long as men have their Veſſels only waſhed with the water of life, and not filled up to the brim, they will never be upon ſuch terms of advantage, to do that great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for God, whereunto the Law of their high and heavenly calling ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Conſolations of the Goſpel, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> eſpecially where they have moſt of God, and of the Goſpel in them, are very rich and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, need not be any mans doubt or queſtion, if he conſiders a little what the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh of them in the Goſpel: <hi>Wherein God</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>willing more abundantly to ſhew the Heirs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the immutability of his Counſel, confirmed it by an Oath, that by two immutable things, by which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have</hi> (valid, or) <hi>ſtrong Conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us,</hi> Heb. 6.17, 18. We ſee God hath raiſed the Pin of the Goſpel to ſuch a height, that it is not only able to furniſh men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with a good proportion of comfort and peace, but he hath put ſo much of himſelf, of his grace and love, bounty and magnificence into it, that it powreth out unto men abundantly of the higheſt and ſtrongeſt Conſolations; although there be very few that underſtand, how or where, to hold their hearts, that theſe pourings out of the Goſpel may run, or fall into them. Now, the Conſolation which is ſtrong and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (indeed) is able, not only to ſuppreſs, and ſubdue its enemies (diſcouragements, doubts, fears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and withal to maintain it ſelf in peace againſt them: but alſo to diſcourage (as it were) and diſhearten theſe Enemies from ever attempting any thing againſt it. For he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is ſtrong whoſe ſtrength being known maketh an enemy to have no mind to meddle with him, but cauſeth him to fear to riſe up in oppoſition againſt him; by means whereof be enjoyes himſelf with little or no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or diſturbance. Such is the Conſolation of the Goſpel, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly found by men, when it is received in the power and glory of it. It is not only able to ſuppreſs, and keep under fears, and doubtings, and ſad apprehenſions in every kind, which are enemeies to it; But to enjoy it ſelf in fulneſs of peace and ſecurity, without any danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infeſted, or annoyed by them. This is the height of the Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, he that is baptized into the Spirit of it, enjoyeth himſelf with a divine ſecurity, in the frailty of a weak and mortal man. To this we may add that of <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. <hi>Whom having not ſeen, ye love, in whom, though now ye ſee him not, yet believing, ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory.</hi> Now in telling them, <hi>that believing they rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory;</hi> I ſuppoſe his meaning
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95016:48"/>was not, that they did now at this time actually enjoyce at the rate he ſpeaks of, however at other times they may be penſive and ſaid: But that they were in ſuch a ſtate or condition, and had ſuch a Goſpel preach'd, known, and believed amongſt them, whereby they might and ought to rejoyce habitually, and as oft as they ſhould ſet their hearts about it. For in Scripture Phraſe, Perſons many times are ſaid to do that, not only which they actually, or at preſent, do, but which they may, or have opportunity, and means, and are like to do: And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſpeaketh of men as doing that which is their duty, and what they ought to do, whether they actually and indeed do it or no. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. it is ſaid of the Heathens, <hi>when they knew God;</hi> that is, when they had opportunity and means to know him, they ſtood upon account to him as men that did know God; ſo that if they did not walk, and act, and glorifie him as became men and women that did really and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know God, they were as deep in condemnation, as ſuch perſons would be, who did know him, and yet refuſe, or neglect, to glorifie him. So 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Hereby know ye</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> &amp;c. that is, you may at any time know and diſcern this Spirit. Thus <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Rulers are ſaid to be, not a terrour to good works, but to the evil;</hi> not, that they are actually, or alwaies are, either the one or other (I mean, <hi>no terrour to good works, but unto evil;</hi> too frequent experience proves the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are a terrour to good works, and not to evil) but becauſe they ought to be ſo. ſo <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. they are ſaid to <hi>attend continually upon this very thing</hi> (the Service of God in the due execution of their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) not that they do thus attend, but becauſe the Law of their Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution binds them unto it, they ought to attend continually hereupon. This kind of expreſſion occurs frequently in the Scripture. We might add that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.10. <hi>I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.</hi> I am come upon ſuch terms unto the World, and have brought along with me ſuch a Goſpel out of the boſome of my Father, and opened unto men ſuch Counſels and gracious intendments of his touching his love, and favour, and that affection towards the world, that they may have life in what meaſure or proportion they pleaſe: They may have life, that is, comfort and peace, joy, happineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for life, in Scripture, frequently imports, a being with much contentment; death, the contrary) more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, <hi>viz.</hi> than ever they will ſeek or endeavour to have and enjoy; or <hi>more abundantly,</hi> that is, that they may have it with all the variety of pleaſures and delights they can deſire. So likewiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.14. <hi>That he would grant to us, that being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, we might ſerve him without fear,</hi> &amp;c. To ſerve God <hi>without fear</hi> (my Brethren) this alſo doth amount to matter of ſtrong Conſolation. For what can a man or woman deſire more for their comfort, than to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above fears, ſorrows, troubles, and every thing that is of a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95016:48"/>diſcouraging and diſconſolating nature in, or from the World? The horn of Salvation is lift up to ſuch an height in the Goſpel, that, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of it in its Elevation, we may ſerve God without fear of any enemy, or evil whatſoever; and that not only for ſuch a time, day, or year, as when, or whilſt, we are, or may be extraordinarily acted, or ſuperacted by a ſpirit of joy, but even all the daies of our lives. This horn of Salvation is ſo raiſed in the Goſpel, that peace, and joy may flow in the hearts and ſouls of men uniformly; as a great River whoſe waters fail not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We added this, that they whoſe hearts do not ſerve them, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> to quit themſelves like men indeed, for obtaining that incomparable prize we ſpeak of; the firſt born of the Conſolations of the Goſpel, are not like to obtain it. It was the ſaying of an Heathen man, <hi>Deus omnia labore vendit:</hi> God ſells all his Commodities unto men for labour and pains; His meaning was, that God was wont not to give, or grant, any thing (at leaſt ordinarily) but upon a diligent uſe of means and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. That which he is ſaid to do, or give freely, moſt freely, (I mean, the grace of Juſtification) yet he gives it not but by, and upon the uſe of means; I mean, Believing. Neither doth he give Faith, or Believing, but by, and through, means uſed to obtain it, <hi>viz.</hi> by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent hearing, attending unto, and conſidering the Goſpel preached. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, Rom.</hi> 10.17. compared with <hi>Mark</hi> 4.24. and <hi>Act.</hi> 16.14. Cha. 17.11, 12. As for thoſe that think Juſtification can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be free, or of Free Grace, in caſe it be obtained by believing, they declare hereby, that they little underſtand what the Scripture means by Grace, or by God's doing any thing freely. You may do well to take notice of this, though it falls in only Collaterally with the buſineſs in hand. It is worthy your obſervation, and will help you to underſtand many paſſages of Scripture, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That when Grace is oppoſed to Works it is not oppoſed to Works ſimply, much leſs any kind of Works, but to Works in point of merit, and as in the ſtricteſt Juſtice they deſerve, that he who doth them ſhould be juſtified by God. In this ſenſe Grace is oppoſed to Works in Juſtification: If it were by Works in this ſenſe, that is, by, or upon, the merit of Works, then (indeed) it could not be of Grace, or freely given unto men, becauſe it ſhould be due to them in point of Juſtice. But Juſtification is ſaid therefore to be free, and of Grace, becauſe though God confers it upon no man, but by, and through, his belieeving, and this believing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much of a man to compaſs it; yet he gives it upon ſuch terms, or upon ſuch Works, which are far from any meritoriouſneſs of ſo high a reward as Juſtification: Yea, he gives it ſo, that he ſtood no waies bound to juſtifie any perſon under Heaven upon any ſuch terms, nor (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) upon any other. In this reſpect he is ſaid to juſtifie men freely, and of meer Grace. Yea, whereas he now requires of men Faith
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:95016:49"/>ſimply, and only, for their Juſtification, if he had required a full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith, or faith in the utmoſt perfection of it; yea, or any hard or difficult work or ſervice beſides, in order hereunto, yet had Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification been free notwithſtanding, yea, of Free Grace, as now it is. For whatſoever good thing a perſon is no waies bound to do, and yet doth it, he is free in the doing of it, and doth it of Grace. But this only by the way. The buſineſs before us is to ſhew, that no man is like to carry the high priviledge or prize, of being lifted up to Heaven upon the wing of Goſpel Conſolations, but only he that is willing to advance a proportion of means anſwerable to it. He that intends to make his neſt among the Stars, whilſt he carries a body of fleſh and bloud about him, muſt reſolve to climbe up the Ladder of many rounds and ſtaves, to carry life and Salvation on the end, which yet (we know) may be done by the loweſt and leaſt degree of Faith, if it be unfeined and ſound: Life (I ſay) and ſalvation, in the very loweſt terms, where they are to be compaſſed by men, yet cannot be obtained but by great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care. What ſtriving, what contention of mind heart and ſoul, doth it require of men to be counted worthy or meet for that bleſſed Inheritance? This the Scripture takes notice of, and runs very high in expreſſions of this import (of getting to Heaven, of obtaining Salvation upon any terms) <hi>Luke</hi> 17.24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtreight gate, for many I ſay unto you will ſeek to enter in and ſhall not be able.</hi> So Luke 21.36. <hi>Watch and pray continually that ye may be counted worthy to eſcape all theſe things that ſhall come to paſs, and to ſtand before the Son of man.</hi> So Joh. 6.27. <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that which endureth to eternal life.</hi> So again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Let us labour therefore to enter into that reſt</hi> Heb. 6.12. <hi>See that ye be not ſlothful, but followers of them, who through Faith and Patience inherite the Promiſes,</hi> (with many the like.) By theſe places it appeareth, that for a man to get to Heaven in the lower or loweſt way of all, and that which is moſt paſſable with fleſh and bloud, will yet put him hard to it, and impoſe on him much labour both of Fleſh and Spirit. If this requires ſo much labour and travel both of body and ſoul, be a matter of ſo much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and is not to be effected without ſuch intentions of mind, ſuch ſtrainings and ſtrivings of the heart and ſoul, as the Scriptures now mentioned clearly imply; What will it require to go by the way of the Mountains, to be carried thither in a Triumphant Chariot of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and rejoycing, to be accompanied with that joy, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory, all along a mans Pilgrimage through this World? I ſay, if a creeping, or ſcambling Faith, (as we may call it) ever and anon ready to be aſſaulted and encumbred with fears and doubtings, will take ſo much of a man, of the heart and ſoul of a man, to procure and raiſe it, and then to feed, maintain, and keep it in life and being unto the end; What will ſuch a Faith require in this kind,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:95016:49"/>which ſhall trample all fears and doubtings under its feet; Which ſhall make the face of the inward man to ſhine like the face of an Angel: which ſhall diſſolve more than the one half of the difference between this preſent World, and the World which is to come? Therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, as the Captain ſaid concerning his freedom of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> that he purchaſed <hi>and obtained it with a great ſum of money,</hi> Acts 22.28. So if any man be free of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is from above, and of the Conſolations thereof; I mean, be free from all fears of the wrath which is to come, and raigns with aſſurance like a Prince, he hath obtained it by a very great ſum of ſpiritual labour, and with many high Conteſts of ſoul. The water of this Well cannot be come at, cannot be drank, but by breaking through an Hoſt of the <hi>Philiſtines:</hi> I mean, of many temptations and allurements from the Fleſh, and from the World, which are hard and tedious to be encounted, reſiſted, and overcome by fleſh and bloud. The Apoſtle requires <hi>a being rooted and grounded in love,</hi> (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19.) to put men into a capacity of <hi>comprehending with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height, and to know the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> and ſo <hi>to be filled with all the fulneſs of God.</hi> Conſider the place; he clearly implies, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being <hi>rooted and grounded in love,</hi> men and women are not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, or condition, of comprehending what is <hi>the breadth, and length, and depth, and height of the love of Chriſt which paſſeth knowledge.</hi> He doth not ſpeak of a full, or abſolute comprehenſion of this love: For this no Creature whatſoever, how deeply and firmly ſoever <hi>rooted and grounded in love,</hi> is capable of. Yea, the Apoſtle himſelf, preſently ſpeaking of the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith, it <hi>paſſeth knowledge;</hi> meaning, that the compaſs or riches of this love are greater, and more vaſt, than to be fully eſtimated and computed by men, yea, or by any finite or created underſtanding whatſoever; but he ſpeaketh of ſuch a <hi>comprehenſion</hi> (or apprehenſion rather) which the nature of man may by means and helps be advanced and carried up unto; which is a <hi>comprehenſion</hi> compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; I mean, in reſpect of that narrow, imperfect, and obſcure knowledge hereof, which is generally found amongſt the Saints them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: becauſe the hearts of ſo few of them ſerve them to be at the coſts and charges of that which is more raiſed, and would do double the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the other.</p>
               <p>But firſt, What doth he mean, by being <hi>rooted and grounded in love?</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> Secondly, Why doth he require ſuch a qualification as this, a being <hi>rooted and grounded in love,</hi> to put them into a capacity of <hi>comprehending the heights, and depths, and lengths, and breadths</hi> thereof (of the love of <hi>Chriſt?</hi>) I ſuppoſe theſe dimenſions here ſpoken of do denote four ſpecial things conſiderable in the myſtery of the love of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, The <hi>breadth</hi> of it, I conceive, imports the extent of the love of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:95016:50"/>
                  <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as it is held forth and declared in the Goſpel, in reference to the Perſons to whom it is vouchſafed and born. As concerning this dimenſion (the <hi>breadth,</hi> or extent) of it; he had a little before (<hi>viz.</hi> in the former part of this Chapter, and all along the ſecond) taught them, that it was Commenſurable unto the World, and that it did not contain it ſelf within the bounds of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, but dilated and ſpread it ſelf over the whole World, and rejoyced over all the Nations of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>length</hi> of it ſeems to note the duration of it, which reacheth from Eternity to Eternity, or (in the Scripture expreſſion) <hi>from Everlaſting to Everlaſting.</hi> It was conceived in his breaſt of old be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundations of the World were laid: from thence it brake forth, and diſcovered itſelf in time, and now it runs along, and hath continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in and with the World, and will continue together with the glorious fruits and effects of it to Eternity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>depth</hi> of this love may point at either the great and moſt profound Condeſcention, whereunto <hi>Chriſt</hi> was drawn by it for the benefit of men, as when he ſtooped from the height of all glory in the higheſt Heavens, to ſeek for a loſt World in the heart or lower parts of the Earth, having undergone by the way a moſt dolorous, painful, and ignominious death; or elſe, at the peculiar manner of the efficacy, or working of this love, in that it wrought down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, even to the depth and bottom (as it were) of that miſery, wherein the World lay plunged, and out of which there had been no redemption for it, had not the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> we ſpeak of, by its moſt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable virtue, ſtrength, and vigour, made its way to it, and wrought the Cure.</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) By the <hi>height</hi> of this love, the Apoſtle (que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs) ſignifieth, either the lifting up, and magnifying of it ſelf over and above the high miſdemeanours and provocations of the World, by which it was not turned out of its way, nor ſo much as put to the leaſt ſtand; Or elſe the efficacious and ſucceſsful tendency of it to raiſe the bleſſedneſs of thoſe, that ſhould reap the fruits of it, exceeding high. Now to put you into a capacity to comprehend theſe dimenſions of the love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to comprehend them (I ſay) as they may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by you to your unſpeakable comfort and joy, you muſt be <hi>rooted and grounded in love.</hi> But what is it to be <hi>rooted and grounded in love?</hi> (For this was the former queſtion propounded.) I anſwer: Some by the <hi>love</hi> here ſpoken of, wherein the Apoſtle requeſts of God, that they might be <hi>rooted and grounded,</hi> underſtand the love of God; that is, that love which God beareth unto mankind, and expreſſeth in the Goſpel. But though it be good to be <hi>rooted and grounded in this love,</hi> yet is not this the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt here: As for other reaſons, ſo more eſpecially for this. That this love is, upon the matter, and for
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:95016:50"/>ſubſtance, the ſame thing which he would have them to be in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of comprehending. For the love of God and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are (in effect) the ſame. Now, to be <hi>rooted and grounded in</hi> any <hi>love</hi> (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, cannot be ſaid to be a means to make us able to <hi>comprehend</hi> (in the ſenſe lately declared) the ſame love. Becauſe it muſt thus be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, before we can be <hi>rooted and grounded</hi> in it. Therefore (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) the <hi>love</hi> here ſpoken of, is that affection of love, which is, or ought to be in men; whether towards God, or towards man, or both: though I judge it beſt to underſtand it of both. But what is it to be <hi>rooted</hi> in this <hi>love? Rooting</hi> in a tree implies a kind of conveying, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or infinuating it ſelf into the Earth, by thoſe parts of it, which we call the root which are given unto it by God in Nature for that end and purpoſe. By this means it comes to have a kind of firm footing and ſtanding in the earth, where alſo, being once <hi>rooted,</hi> it grows. Now to be <hi>rooted in love</hi> ſeems to import ſome ſuch thing as this: Namely, that a man hath by the uſe of his Reaſon, Judgment, Underſtanding, and Conſcience (faculties and powers given unto him for this, and ſuch like purpoſes) as it were conveyed himſelf into the midſt of ſuch Reaſons, Motives, and Arguments (whereof there are plenty in the Scriptures; yea, and many in the book of Nature and Conſcience alſo) which are effectual and proper to fill him, heart and ſoul, with theſe affections of love to God and men. Many there are, that may be ſaid (in a ſenſe, and that according to truth) to love God, and to love men, that yet are not <hi>rooted and grounded</hi> in this affection. Either they have conceived, or taken hold of ſome light thoughts, perſwading them to the love of God and men, or convincing them of their duty in this kind. Or it may be there being in men a kind of natural love to God, as in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their Parents, they are under ſome impreſſions of this affection. But then a perſon, man or woman, may properly be ſaid to be <hi>rooted and grounded in love,</hi> when they have conſidered over and over, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaten their hearts, and ſouls, and conſciences with ſuch conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motives, which are as natural and proper, not only to provoke and ingage them to love both God and men, but alſo to continue reſolute and firm in this affection; as the Earth is to give unto the Trees fixedneſs and faſtneſs of ſtanding, where its place at preſent is of ſtanding, when it hath once ſhot its roots into it, and wrapped them about the ſtones of it, as <hi>Job</hi> 8.17. When a tree is thus rooted it will bear a ſtrong guſt of wind, without being borne down, or overturned by it: So when a man hath had his ſoul, judgment, and conſcience much exerciſed with, intereſſed, and ingaged in; when he hath throughly pondered, and kindly dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted thoſe great and bleſſed truths, which have a kind of imperious and commanding influence upon men, to cauſe them to love God and men, he will become <hi>one ſpirit</hi> with this heavenly affection, and ſo (as it were) incorporated in ſoul with it, that the ſtrength of death it ſelf will hardly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:95016:51"/>be able to ſeparate him from it, much leſs is he in any great danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome by other temptations.</p>
               <p>For the other Metaphor of being <hi>grounded</hi> (or rather as the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>founded</hi>) <hi>in love,</hi> this (I conceive) notes the conſtant exerciſe, or practice of the affection, as the former of <hi>rooting,</hi> pointed at the method or means of introducing and ſetting it in the ſoul. And as an houſe or building (for from theſe it is borrowed) ſtands firm and faſt upon its foundation, and is not removed of, and on, at any time; So he prayes for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> That, in order to the end mentioned, they may be and continue as uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and conſtant in ſhewing love both unto God and men, as well in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as in ſufferings, without interruption, or declining at any time.</p>
               <p>But (to come to the latter Queſtion propounded) how, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> or why a being <hi>rooted and grounded in love</hi> ſhould make men capable, or able, to <hi>comprehend the love of Chriſt,</hi> in the four Dimenſions ſpecified. There are two things to be conſidered in the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Love is of a dilating and enlarging nature, it opens the heart to a greater wideneſs, and makes it capacious to receive many things, which otherwiſe it would not. Charity or Love, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>believeth all things, hopeth all things,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7.) mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it diſpoſeth and inclineth men to believe and hope the beſt in all things concerning others, <hi>viz.</hi> where there is no apparent ground to judge otherwiſe. Whilſt the heart of a man is deſtitute of the love of God and men, it is ſcant, and narrow, and (as it were) clung toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; there is no room in it for things of any great extent or compaſs to be received or entertained there. Men that love none but themſelves, their hearts are ſhut up againſt God and men, and they think that all other hearts are ſo likewiſe. Whereas if a man be ſenſible that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath a large heart, can do and ſuffer thus, and thus, can ſpend, and be ſpent upon the Service of God, and the Generation of men round about him; ſuch a man will be ready to ſay of others, it may very well be that they likewiſe are the ſame, or rather greater in goodneſs with my ſelf. That men find themſelves inclined by nature to give good things unto their Children that ask them, is, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> plainly intimateth (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11.) a riſe and advantage unto their Faith, to believe that God much more is ready and willing to give good things unto thoſe that ſhall by prayer ask them of him. Therefore when a man ſhall find his heart drawn out in this heavenly affection of Love, far beyond his Children, even unto God his Father, and unto all his Brethren; deſcending from the ſame Progenitors, and partakers of the ſame fleſh and bloud with him, and ſhall for ſome ſpace of time have had the experience of the real, genuine, and conſtant working of this affection in him, this muſt needs facilitate and prepare the way of his Faith throughly to believe all that immenſe love which <hi>Chriſt</hi> bare, and yet beareth unto the World, as it is held forth and aſſerted in the Goſpel. And this is (in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95016:51"/>Phraſe before us) to <hi>comprehend the love of Chriſt</hi> in all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions of it. This then is one Conſideration in which to be <hi>rooted and grounded in love,</hi> muſt needs be conceived to enable men to the ſaid <hi>comprehenſion.</hi> Or elſe another thing may be, that God, conſidering how highly he doth honour and prize this heavenly affection of Love, where he findeth it, how greatly he delighteth in it in his Creature, therefore hath reſerved ſuch a great and excellent reward as that compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion we ſpeak of, to ſtir up the hearts of men to deſire and poſſeſs themſelves of it. And (haply) this may be the meaning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>As it is written, eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> The place hath formerly been underſtood, as if it were meant of the enjoyments in Heaven; but now men more generally, and more truly underſtand, that by the things here ſpoken of are meant the hidden and ſecret things of the Goſpel, the ſeveral ſtrains and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the manifold wiſdom and counſel of the righteouſneſs and love of God that are couched there: <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man the things,</hi> &amp;c. Some underſtand the <hi>heart</hi> of a natural man, or of a perſon not yet converted. But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he means as well the <hi>heart</hi> of a man converted, but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and weakly furniſhed with the Love of God, as unconverted. God is ſaid to have <hi>prepared</hi> (in the Goſpel) things of moſt rare and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful conſideration, <hi>for thoſe that love him</hi> [meaning thoſe that love him like himſelf, that love him, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>with a pure heart fervently</hi>] becauſe he reſerveth for, and intendeth the diſcovery and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of His moſt wiſe and profound Counſels here unto ſuch perſons, judging them the only meet and worthily qualified ſubjects for ſuch Communications. Love and true Friendſhip are the moſt reaſonable and equitable grounds of imparting ſecrets unto men; according to that of our Saviour to his Diſciples. <hi>Henceforth I call you not Servants: for the Servant knoweth not what his Maſter doth: but I have called you Friends</hi> [that is, have dealt with you as with Friends, knowing that you truly love me] <hi>for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you, Joh.</hi> 15.15. The Goſpel conſiſts of the plain and eaſie things of God, and of the deep things of God (as the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10.) Now the ſpirit of a man, by the ordinary aſſiſtance only of the Spirit of God, may ſearch and comprehend the eaſie and plain things of God in the Goſpel: but it muſt be the Spirit of God, which he is wont in ſpecial manner to <hi>give to thoſe that obey him, Acts</hi> 5.32. (that is, who expreſs their <hi>love</hi> to him by obeying him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21.23.) which Spirit is called the <hi>Spirit of Revelation,</hi> Eph. 1.17. that <hi>ſearcheth</hi> (that enableth men to <hi>ſearch</hi> and dive into) <hi>the deep things of God</hi> (in the Goſpel) which deep things are very emphatically and ſignificantly expreſſed, by what <hi>the eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95016:52"/>nor have entred into the heart of man,</hi> &amp;c. meaning, that they are things ſo tranſcendently wonderful for the excellency and raviſhing import of them, that nothing like unto them in ſuch a conſideration, ever came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the apprehenſion, either of any of the ſenſes, or of the underſtanding, or imagination, or diſcoveries of men. Amongſt the <hi>deep</hi> things of God, there are none deeper or more profoundly wonderful, none more remote from the ordinary thoughts and apprehenſions of men than the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>love of Chriſt</hi> ſpecified, <hi>the breadth, and length, and depth, and height</hi> of this <hi>love.</hi> Now, as God is ſaid to have <hi>prepared</hi> things of ſo myſterious and glorious an import, to impart in a way of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or friendly retribution, unto thoſe that <hi>love</hi> him, ſo (doubtleſs) he is more free, and large-hearted, in theſe Communications, unto thoſe that are <hi>rooted and grounded</hi> in this affection, that is, who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed moſt love to him, and hereupon are moſt likely to continue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in unto the end.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ſee that men are not like ever to know what the rich and glorious Conſolations of the Goſpel mean, unleſs they take a regular and due courſe to intereſs themſelves in ſo high a priviledge, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, unleſs they ſhall be <hi>rooted and grounded in love,</hi> as hath been ſhewed.</p>
               <p>The third (and laſt) particular of the three mentioned, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> was this, that they who are not children of the richeſt and higheſt Conſolations of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, are not in any competent poſture, or worthy capacity for ſhewing forth the vertues, or lovely things of God; which yet is every man's duty to do (as hath been declared.) For the proof of this, it is to be conſidered, Firſt, That a competent poſture (as I call it) or richneſs of capacity, for any worthy ſervice or employment, eſpecially relating unto God, requireth theſe two things: Firſt, That a mans heart be full of the work, that he hath a ſtrong propenſion to be active in it. Secondly, This is required alſo, that he hath skill, or ſtrength, dexterity and abilities otherwiſe, for the worthy and due performance of it. For if either of theſe be wanting, <hi>(viz.)</hi> either a good will to the ſervice, or elſe skill and dexterity, to manage it, the work will ſuffer, either in the performance, or by the non-performance of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is clear, that no man's heart will be full of the ſervice we ſpeak of, unleſs the ſtrength of the Goſpel-Conſolations hath taken his heart kindly, and made it (in a ſenſe) like unto the heart of God himſelf. Secondly, As evident likewiſe it is, that he that hath not been made drunk with the New Wine of the Goſpel, that hath not drank deep of the ſweet and rich Conſolations of it, muſt needs be defective in point of dexterity and skill how to manage ſuch a work. For firſt, That the heart of a man will never be full of the excellency of the work or ſervice, unleſs it hath had intimate and familiar converſe with thoſe rich Conſolations of the Goſpel, we may conceive upon this account:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95016:52"/>Such a frame and temper of heart and ſoul, as we now ſpeak of, that is carried out with ſtrength of deſire to be ſhewing forth the vertues of God in the World, cannot reaſonably but be ſuppoſed, and judged ſuch a frame and complexion of ſoul, which is morally diſtant by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from that which we call (though not ſo truly or properly) the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural frame of it, or that frame which at firſt commonly it worketh or reduceth it ſelf unto. For take the heart of a man, in the natural frame and temper of it, that is, wherein it was found before the Goſpel came at it, and made an alteration in it, and compare it with the frame of the heart we now ſpeak of, the diſtance between them will be found as great as that betwixt Heaven and Earth; the heart, before the Goſpel touched it, was a dull heart, full of it ſelf, of its own thoughts, of its own intereſt, of its own luſts; no thought ſtirring or moving in it of the leaſt contriving, or intendment, to beſtead the name of the great God of Heaven and Earth upon ſuch terms, not the leaſt impulſe or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, to bring forth the vertues and heavenly things of God into the World. The Soul, until it be Evangelically inſpired, is at as great a diſtance from ſuch a conſtitution or frame, wherein it ſhould be active for God, and zealouſly addicted to the declaring of his Name unto the World, as lightly can be imagined. Now then conſider, that as the Heavens and the Earth, being at ſo great a diſtance the one from the other, and ſo fixed to their reſpective Centers, as they are, can never greet or kiſs one another, nor touch one another, nor ever change places, or ſituation, but it muſt be by a ſtrong, and mighty, and out-ſtretched arm: So likewiſe, in caſe we ſhall ſuppoſe ſo great and wonderful an alteration in the heart and ſpirit of a man, that whereas it was full of it ſelf, and no place found in it for any thought concerning God, for the magnifying of him, or for the doing any great thing for him; it is now altered and changed in ſuch a ſtrange manner, that it comes to be filled to the brim with zeal for the glory of God, and with a deſire to have him great in the World, and to have his Name exalted upon a high Throne amongſt men; this change (I ſay) muſt needs be ſuppoſed to be brought to paſs by the intervening of ſome means or other of an admirable and tranſcendent vertue, of ſuch an efficiency which is proper and likely to effect it. This muſt of neceſſity be ſuppoſed; For Reaſon will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to think of Effects brought to paſs without proportionable Cauſes; great Effects without great and weighty Cauſes anſwerable unto them. Now the change of the heart mentioned, being ſo wonderful and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible a change, it is next to that which is impoſſible to conceive, or for the underſtanding of Men, or Angels to imagine, how ſuch a Change as this ſhould be brought to paſs, as namely, that a man ſhould be wholly driven out of himſelf, and out of his own heart and ſoul, that all his fooliſh and unworthy deſires to advance and ſeek himſelf ſhould be caſt out of him: And that deſires of glorifying God in the World like
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95016:53"/>unto himſelf ſhould ſpring up in their ſtead; Nothing (I ſay) lightly imaginable that ſhould alter the property of the heart of a man upon ſuch terms as theſe, but the ſoul-raviſhing Conſolations of the Goſpel, and that joy in the Holy Ghoſt, which is unſpeakable and full of glory: Theſe, being all ſpirit and life, and of an heavenly activity, are a means rationally promiſing even as great and ſtrange a turn in the ſoul of a man as this. As we ſee New Wine, becauſe of the ſpirit-fulneſs, the heat and activeneſs of it, being freely drank, will make men that are of a ſlow ſpeech or diſcourſe, backward and indiſpoſed to much talk, will make (I ſay) even theſe men to forget themſelves, and to pour out words apace, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of thoſe that love, as we ſay, to hear themſelves talk; the pleaſant vapour of the Wine over-coming with the warmth and heat of it the coldneſs of the Brain, and ſo giving free motion unto the Tongue, under ſuch a provocation or encouragement as this, even men that are naturally ſlow will ſpeak and utter themſelves at another manner of rate than ever they were known to do before: Even ſo when the ſtrong and high-ſpirited Conſolations of the Goſpel have once taken the head, and the heart and ſoul of a man, and ſeated themſelves there, they will ſoon alter and change the inward conſtitution and temper of the man; So that whereas before he was dull and heavie, yea, and as dead unto God, and could ſavour and reliſh nothing but his own things, his own perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal intereſt, as his eaſe, pleaſure, and the like: Now he is (as it were) turned quite about, and is all for God; theſe Goſpel Conſolations, when they are apprehended clearly in their ſtrength, and height, and ſet to work in the ſoul accordingly, then they are operative like unto themſelves, and have ſuch a property, and peculiarity of vertue in them, ſo to affect the heart and ſoul, that they will not be able to refrain, or contain themſelves, but will be ſtill ſpeaking of their great and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Benefactor: When once they ſhall have received a ſtrong ſenſe and feeling of that abundant grace from him, which the Goſpel preſenteth, and tendereth unto the World, and are poſſeſt of thoſe matters of joy, and high exaltation of ſpirit, all the waters of this World will never be able to quench this flame, but they will be ever and anon breaking forth againſt all oppoſitions of the Fleſh, and all carnal Intereſts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, laughing all theſe to ſcorn; and if it be poſſible, they will lift up the Name of the Great God that hath done ſuch great things for them, that hath (in effect) prevented them with life and immortality already.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> Unleſs a perſon hath drunk liberally of the Conſolations we ſpeak of, unleſs he be like a Prince in his ſpiritual eſtate and demeſns, and lives in high ſatisfaction of ſoul, he will never be able to ſpeak out, like an Angel, the vertues, the pleaſant and lovely things of his God, he will never attain unto a lip of excellency for the ſervice: But the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſuch a man, whether by words or actions, will be lean and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95016:53"/>ſtarveling, no waies Commenſurable, nor holding out with the Heights and Depths, with the great and worthy things of God. No man can diſcourſe the Royal ſtate and excellency of a King or Prince, but an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant Courtier that hath had Communion with the grandeur, and glory, and goodly things belonging thereunto. So a man that hath but lightly taſted of the grace, goodneſs, and bounty of God in the Goſpel, that hath alwaies kept in the valleys of the viſions thereof, and had Communion only with the rudiments and firſt beginnings of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical knowledge, can never be able to ſhew out the <hi>the vertues of God,</hi> or bring them forth into a perfect light. Something in this kind ſuch a perſon poſſibly may do, he may (as it were) whiſper, and ſtammer out, in ſome broken manner, ſomewhat of the tranſcendent excellencies of God. And verily this is the length of ſuch a mans arm: he can lift up the Name of God no otherwiſe, or upon no better terms in the World. But now perſons that have (for a conſiderable ſpace of time) dwelt much in the upper Regions of the Goſpel which border upon the third Heavens, where life and immortality dwell (as it were) bodily, perſons that have, with a clear eye of Faith, ſeen the unſearchable riches of the grace of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and know not how to fear, or whereof to be afraid, being full of the love of God, which caſteth out fear; they are the only men that are able to ſpeak a Dialect proper to expreſs thoſe glorious things of God, which are otherwiſe hard to be uttered, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally unto the World, being ſo dull of hearing in this kind; the only men that know how to tranſlate the vertues of God into ſuch a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, whether by words or actions, that the World may come to ſome reaſonable and competent knowledge of them. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle, <hi>Peter</hi> admoniſhed his <hi>ſcattered</hi> Saints, to whom he writeth thus, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>You are a Royal Prieſthood: that you ſhould ſhew forth the praiſes of him that calleth you;</hi> meaning, that they were Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prieſts, of a Royal and Princely Extraction, and had withal ſpiritual or Evangelical Demeſns and Revenues of joy, peace, and heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, anſwerable to both their great dignities of Kings and Prieſts, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. and that they had received theſe great things from God, that hereby they might be fit, and in a capacity to ſhew forth the vertues of God, and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that had called them out of darkneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> clearly implying, That they which are not <hi>Royal</hi> (that is, <hi>royally ſpirited,</hi> and ſo far from all ſervility, and ſlaviſhneſs of ſpirit, through fear) are not in a condition to ſhew unto the World, either their Creator, or Redeemer, in all their glory, or like unto themſelves. It is the Prayer of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.15. <hi>O Lord open thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.</hi> Now God hath no way, or means, at leaſt none ſo proper to open any man's lips to a due wideneſs <hi>for the ſhewing forth of his praiſe,</hi> as by cauſing him to know that by the bloud of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> his <hi>Conſeience is purged from dead works,</hi> ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. And thus we ſee
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95016:54"/>the ſecond thing alſo cleared, that they that are not the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the richeſt and choiſeſt Conſolations of the Goſpel are in no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious or worthy capacity to ſhew forth, or make a declaration unto the World of the vertues, or lovely things of God. And if they ſhall attempt to do any thing in this kind, they will do it to loſs and diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, I mean comparatively, in reſpect of what they might have done, had they ſtood upon an higher ground of Goſpel peace. For otherwiſe in ſimple conſideration, it is moſt true which the <hi>Levites</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.5. that the glorious <hi>Name</hi> of God <hi>excelleth</hi> (or, is exalted above) all bleſſing and praiſe. Conſonant whereunto are theſe ſayings of the Son of <hi>Sirach, What power have we to praiſe him? For he is above all his works. Praiſe ye the Lord, and magnifie him as much as ye can, yet doth he far exceed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 43.28.30. And thus we have done with the proof of that, which was ſuppoſed and taken for granted in the Reaſon, which was, That it is every man's duty, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the duty of every Believer, to deſire, and ſeek after part and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the higheſt Conſolations, which the Goſpel adminiſtreth, and which are attainable by men thereby; becauſe without being baptized with ſuch a baptiſm as this, men will not be in that ſingular and ſignal capacity to ſhew forth the vertues or pleaſant and lovely things of God, which they ought to lift up their hearts and deſires unto.</p>
               <p>That which (as we ſaid) is aſſerted plainly in the Reaſon, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> is, that without being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> men and women will never be able to reach the Conſolations of the Goſpel, where they run high, and carry in them a ſtrong ſavour of life and immortality. Now, for the opening and clearing of this unto you, you are to take knowledge, and conſider, that men and women may ſo go to work, may ſtand upon ſuch terms before God, and the Goſpel, for many years together, that according to the ordinary and ſettled courſe of Divine Providence in the World, and the exigency of ſecond cauſes, they will not be like (I mean, whilſt they continue in ſuch a way) to know what the Conſolations of the Goſpel in thoſe veins of it, in which they are moſt ſoveraign, rich, and glorious, mean. Yea, the truth is, conſidering the preſent experiment which perſons of both Sexes generally give of themſelves in the World, there is ſcarce one of a City, or two of a Tribe, whoſe hearts do in any meaſure ſerve them to live up to ſuch terms which are like to render them capable of eating the fat and drinking the ſweet of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, men that ſavour (as the Scripture ſpeaks) the things which are of men, and love this preſent World, are not in any likely capacity, but only upon the changing of the frame of their mind, and of their courſe of life, ever to know what is <hi>the hope of their Calling</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) either in reſpect of the ground of it, what pregnant, lively, and abundantly ſatisfactory arguments and grounds there are, why they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95016:54"/>ſhould hope for, and expect all the great things, which the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, or elſe what is his hope in reſpect of the object of it; how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, excellent, and wonderful theſe things are, which are now hoped for, and will be found of all thoſe that ſhall with Faith and Patience wait upon God for them. Men and women (I ſay) that ſtick faſt with their minds and hearts in the mire and clay of this preſent World, are never like to know what the hope of the Goſpel-calling is, (in either conſideration) and conſequently, not to inherit or enjoy in this World the riches of the glory of the Goſpel Conſolations. The Reaſons hereof are many, we ſhall hint only two.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe when the intellectual powers and faculties of the Soul are drunk up with worldly and ſenſual engagements, or over-acted upon the things which are ſeen, they become aukward, indiſpoſed, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable for ſpiritual negotiations, and imployments about heavenly things. By ſuch low and mean Converſe as this, they contract an habit of a kind of intellectual rudeneſs, and diſingeniouſneſs, by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they know not how to quit, or behave themſelves about more noble and high-born objects; nor indeed care not much to have to do with them, or come into their company. Even as perſons that have been alwaies bred and brought up <hi>inter ſordes,</hi> amongſt rude and ruſtical peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of courſe and rough behaviour, cannot preſently change their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and diſpoſition, and ſo become capable of converſing orderly, and according to the principles of Civility, with perſons of better quality and more refined carriage; and by reaſon of a conſciouſneſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this kind, they avoid as much as well they may the company of ſuch perſons: In like manner, thoſe divine diſcoveries made in the Goſpel, thoſe veins of wiſdom, and of the knowledge of God there, upon which (I mean, upon the apprehenſion of which) the high raiſings and liftings up in Evangelical Conſolations (of which we ſpeak) chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend; being of a very fine ſpinning, very ſpiritual, and remote from the common thoughts and apprehenſions of men, and much more from the thoughts of ſuch minds and underſtandings which have accuſtomed themſelves wholly (in a manner) to this Worlds affairs; perſons of this Character, knowing that theſe things lie out of the way of their <hi>Genius,</hi> and that they are not able to conceive of them with much contentment to themſelves, nor to ſpeak of them with contentment unto others, in theſe reſpects take little or no pleaſure to enquire after them, nor to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves to any purpoſe in the ſtudy of them. So then, this is one reaſon why ſuch perſons, who are over-intent and bent upon this preſent World, are not like to aſcend in ſpirit into the Region of light, where the Conſolations we ſpeak of have their dwelling, and are to be found, <hi>(viz.)</hi> becauſe, by continual digging in the earth with their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, apprehenſions, and underſtandings, they make them blunt and dull, and altogether unapt to take the Genuine and through impreſſions of ſuch
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95016:55"/>Goſpel-notions, wherein the riches of the comforts thereof are laid up as in a ſtore-houſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another Reaſon hereof is, becauſe (as we lately heard) the revelations and diſcoveries of theſe Treaſures of Wiſdom and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that are hid in the Goſpel, in the underſtanding and clear ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion whereof (as we lately likewiſe ſhewed) the ſtrength of the ſaid Conſolations lye are made over; or (as we may ſpeak ſafely enough, and yet more plainly) are promiſed by God by way of reward unto thoſe that love him; and proportionably, the fuller meaſure of them to thoſe that love him above the rate of his ordinary friends. Now, the Holy Ghoſt expreſly informs us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. That <hi>if any man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> Yea, the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> goeth ſomewhat further, or at leaſt ſpeaketh more plainly, affirming, That <hi>the friendſhip of the World is enmity with God:</hi> and that <hi>whoſoever will be a friend unto the World, is an enemy unto God.</hi> James 4.4. <hi>If the love of the Father</hi> (of God the Father) be not in men, the deep things of God in the Goſpel, ſuch <hi>as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard,</hi> &amp;c. are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared or made ready to be communicated unto them; nor (indeed) are they prepared, or fit to receive and underſtand them. This then (in a word) is another Reaſon, why perſons, much addicted to this preſent World, are not like to ſit at the upper end of the Table which is ſpread with the Conſolations of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> Neither are they like to taſte of the Feaſt we ſpeak of, or be filled with the beſt and choyceſt of the comforts of the Goſpel, who are hard of bowels, cruel, unmerciful, hard to forget and forgive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries; yea, who have not eyes, and hearts full of commiſeration, and of pity, hearts well exerciſed with mercy. For as mercy (in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Jame's</hi> expreſſion, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>rejoyceth againſt judgment,</hi> in one ſenſe, ſo doth <hi>judgment rejoyce againſt</hi> unmercifulneſs in another. But how, or in what ſenſe, <hi>mercy rejoyceth againſt judgment,</hi> we have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto moſt of you formerly upon another occaſion:<note n="*" place="margin">In a Sermon entituled, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in her Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
                  </note> we ſhall briefly remind you of it again. <hi>Mercy</hi> is ſaid to <hi>rejoyce againſt judgment,</hi> becauſe a perſon that is conſcious to himſelf, that he is of a merciful diſpoſition, and that he hath abounded in works of mercy, ſtands upon a ground of advantage to be made, or to become confident, that God will not deal ſeverely by him, or deſtroy him. It is a frequent Dialect in Scripture to attribute that to the abſtract, or form, which properly belongeth to the ſubject as qualified therewith: <hi>Charity</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>beareth all things. believeth all things, hopeth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.7. That is, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth, but effectually alſo enclineth the perſon who is the ſubject of it, to do all this, meaning, that a perſon endued with Charity doth the one and the other. So <hi>mercy rejoyceth againſt judgment,</hi> that is, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in whom mercy reſideth, is qualified and ſtrengthened hereby <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce againſt judgment,</hi> that is, not to be afraid of judgment; whether by <hi>judgment</hi> we underſtand an appearing before God to be judged, or
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95016:55"/>that Condemnation, which God threatneth in his Word againſt wicked and unbelieving men, which frequently paſſeth under the name of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it cometh much to one. Now, to rejoyce againſt a perſon or a thing, that is terrible in it ſelf, and unto others of the ſame nature and condition with us, imports, or rather ſuppoſeth, and includes a kind of neglect, or non-fearing of it, in him who is ſaid thus to <hi>rejoyce; Rejoyce not againſt me oh mine Enemy, Mic.</hi> 7.8. that is, Do not deſpiſe me, or look upon me as if I were a People or Nation forſaken of my God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am brought low and afflicted; pleaſe not your ſelves over-much with my preſent diſtreſs, be not too confident, as if I ſhould never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover out of this afflicted ſtate and condition. And as mercy in this ſenſe is ſaid to <hi>rejoyce againſt judgment,</hi> ſo may judgment, in a ſenſe little differing, be ſaid to <hi>rejoyce againſt</hi> unmercifulneſs; becauſe of all other kind of ſin or ſinners it will prevail and magnifie it ſelf againſt theſe: the Judgments of God will handle unmerciful men moſt terribly; or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of <hi>James</hi> (in the ſame place) <hi>he ſhall have judgment without mercy that hath ſhewed no mercy.</hi> They that ſhut up their bowels of compaſſion (as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17.) againſt their Brethren, that have need, lye under this judgment of darkneſs in common with other wicked men, <hi>viz.</hi> to think that God is like unto them (<hi>Pſa.</hi> 50.21.) Therefore being regardleſs of other mens miſeries, and no waies encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to acquaint their ſouls with the ſufferings and ſorrows of any but their own, they are apt to transform or change in their imaginations the glory of the moſt gracious and merciful God into the ſimilitude of their own hard-heartedneſs towards others, and ſo muſt needs be under a moſt ſad diſadvantage to apprehend and believe thoſe moſt glorious things which the Goſpel ſpeaketh concerning the love, and mercy, and tenderneſs of compaſſion in God towards men. Which yet muſt be clearly apprehended, and ſteadily believed to inveſt the hearts and ſouls of men with the bleſſed priviledge of being lift up to Heaven upon the wing of Goſpel-Conſolation. So then, of all kind of offenders and tranſgreſſors in the World, men that are ſtraight of bowels, and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate, are the moſt uncapable of part and fellowſhip in the Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Enjoyments of the Goſpel, thoſe eſpecially that are fulleſt of ſpirit and life; the Goſpel every where lowring and frowning upon them, ſtaving and beating them off from all hopes, and conceit of finding mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at the hand of God, or of Salvation, but only upon the change and turning of their hearts within them upſide down. Yea,</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) perſons in any kind who deſpiſe their waies (as <hi>Solomon's</hi> expreſſion is, <hi>Pro.</hi> 19.16.) who live at peradventure, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> and (as we uſe to ſay) hand over-head, who do not narrowly and tenderly pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all their paths, leſt any of them ſhould be found too light. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are ſuch as theſe like to eat of that choice fruit that groweth on that tree which is in the midſt of the Paradiſe of God, nor to be fed with
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95016:56"/>the marrow and fatneſs of the Goſpel Conſolations. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a thouſand to one but they, who ſhall deſpiſe their waies, and reſolve to walk on in ſuch and ſuch courſes <hi>de bene eſſe,</hi> and (as it were) upon proof when no Letter of the Law preſently and expreſly riſeth up againſt it, (I ſay) it is a thouſand to one but that they will be polluted in ſome or other of their paths; and however, the very neglect of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring at the mouth of God in the Scriptures, what is his mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us in all our actions and waies, muſt needs <hi>grieve the good Spirit of God</hi> within us: as (indeed) every practice, yea, and omiſſion alſo doth, about which his intereſt lieth to inſtruct and direct us, if recourſes be not made unto him accordingly. Now, if men ſhall pitch upon a courſe <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and (as we lately expreſſed it) hand over-head, and not conſult with him about the goodneſs or lawfulneſs thereof, this is enough to intangle us with the guilt of <hi>grieving the Spirit of God.</hi> And if the good Spirit of God in men be ſtill grieved, and not again in time relieved and recovered from under this Paſſion; certain it is, that all this while men are in no capacity at all to be carried up by him into the Mount of the Goſpel, where the glory of the Conſolations thereof ſhineth; No, if the Spirit beginneth to withdraw himſelf from men, or forbears his wonted activeneſs and employment, and ſtirring in them, and doth as men, who in time of ſolemn ſorrow and grief are wont to retire themſelves from their wonted company and employments; Now, they are in a very ill capacity, and much diſqualified for the enjoyment of the Conſolations of the Goſpel in their ſtrength and glory. Men will never be <hi>mightily ſtrengthened</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) <hi>in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man</hi> but by the Spirit of God; nor will they ever be <hi>mightily ſtrengthened</hi> there by him, when he is <hi>grieved,</hi> or upon any other terms, than when he is highly pleaſed with the deportments, and comportments of men. Now theſe things being ſo, firſt, that neither men addicted to this preſent World; ſecondly, nor men of ſtraight and hard bowels; nor laſtly, men that deſpiſe their waies in any kind, are meet ſubjects or veſſels prepared to receive the waters of life from the Goſpel, where they are richeſt and ſweeteſt, and moſt quickning to the ſoul; It plainly followeth, that without a very great preſence of the Spirit of God they are not like to arrive at, or to obtain that capacity we ſpeak of: I mean, of being filled with theſe heavenly Conſolations. This is that which we ſaid was directly laid down and affirmed in the Reaſon given.</p>
               <p>For the proof hereof we ſhall not need to add much to what hath been already delivered upon the ſame account. For we have ſhewed and proved from that of the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.13. That <hi>the deeds of the body</hi> cannot be <hi>mortified but by the Spirit;</hi> yea, and by the Spirit acting and working at ſome excellent and very conſiderable rate, which imports a mans being <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> (in the ſenſe firſt declared.) Again, from that of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16. we proved, that no perſon could
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95016:56"/>be <hi>mightily ſtrengthened in the inner man</hi> but by the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> And this (as we ſaid in the former caſe) advancing himſelf to ſome worthy degree in his operation and working upon the heart and conſciences of men. So then, he that is not <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> is like to be a man of this preſent World, addicted to the waies, pleaſures, or profits of it; and conſequently, in an incapacity of thoſe Soveraign Conſolations of the Goſpel we ſpeak of (according to what was lately proved.) For inordinacy of addiction to this preſent World, and the things thereof, is a luſt of the fleſh; and conſequently will not, cannot be effectually ſubdued or mortified but by the aſſiſting efficacy of the Spirit of God. For, <hi>it is the Spirit</hi> (as the Apoſtle informs us) <hi>that luſts againſt the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.17. And (indeed) it is the Spirit only that luſts againſt it, as being contrary to it (as the Apoſtle there ſpeaks) and nothing elſe contrary, at leaſt nothing ſo vigorouſly, ſo perfectly contrary unto it as the Spirit. If you ask me, In what ſenſe or conſideration is the Spirit of God ſaid to <hi>luſt againſt the Fleſh?</hi> I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The nature, or native and proper <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is to deſire, and to delight in, and to act ſuch things as are of a contrary nature and tendency to the Fleſh, and to the things which that deſireth and delighteth in; and in this reſpect may be ſaid to <hi>luſt againſt the Fleſh,</hi> (<hi>viz</hi>) becauſe it deſireth, and this very ſtrenuouſly, things oppoſite to the things deſired by the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit may be ſaid to <hi>luſt againſt the Fleſh,</hi> becauſe he ſtirs up motions, and deſires in men contrary unto thoſe which are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the fleſh. As the fleſh inwardly provokes unto, and cauſeth men to deſire things that are unjuſt, unholy, and things diſpleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> ſecretly exciteth to all things contrary here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, as to things which are juſt, and righteous, and holy.

Now then, as no man is ſlain, or ruined by any perſon (unleſs it be caſually or againſt his will, which is no common or ordinary caſe) but only by him who luſteth againſt his life, and this at an high tate of luſting (for every motion of envy, and hatred, or wiſhing that a man were dead, will not lead a man ſo far as violently to take away his life) ſo neither is the fleſh like to be aboliſhed, crucified, and deſtroyed by any, but only by ſuch, or by that, which luſteth againſt the very life and being of it, and this with ſome potency and ſtrength of luſting. And this muſt needs be the Spirit of God, becauſe there is nothing that luſteth againſt the life, and being, and continuance of it but the Spirit of God.</p>

               <p>Firſt, That if Reaſon or Conſcience do at any time luſt againſt the fleſh, oppoſe or ſtop the luſtings, or movings of it, they do it by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a certain ſuperintendency and inſtigation of the Spirit of God: It is the Spirit of God which puts them upon it. <hi>For in him</hi> [that is to ſay, through or by means of him] (ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of God, and more particularly and appropriately of the Spirit of God) <hi>we live, move, and have our being,</hi> Acts 17.28. When he ſaith, <hi>in him we live,</hi> he doth not mean, we Saints, we Believers, as if none <hi>lived</hi> in God, or through the Spirit of God but ſuch men: But we men (for it was ſpoken by a Heathen Poet) and the Apoſtle doth juſtifie the ſaying by incorporating it with the Word of God, by uſing it as, or inſtead of, a ſaying from God himſelf: For ſo it was, though it paſſed through a corrupt hand, yet it came from God. <hi>In him we live;</hi> we <hi>move,</hi> we men, all men in the World, Saints, or others, <hi>we live in God,</hi> that is, by God, or through God (for ſo the Prepoſition <hi>

If men do not only <hi>live in,</hi> by, or through Gods ſupporting of us, but <hi>move</hi> alſo; and this as well morally as naturally; with our hearts and wills, as well as with our bodies, or the members hereof. Certainly, when we <hi>move</hi> regularly, and as becometh us, as we do when either Reaſon or Conſcience within us do their office in any kind, and when they do not regard the fleſh within us, when ever (I ſay) we act or <hi>move</hi> thus regularly, we do it by ſomewhat more, at leaſt by nothing leſs, than an ordinary exertion or putting forth of his gracious preſence in us. If we move one way or other, morally or naturally, ſinfully or righteouſly; yet every of theſe motions that proceed from us, proceeds alſo from, or by the Spirit of God, (though the ſinfulneſs of no motion proceeds from him) much more when we move according to Rule, then certainly this is by means, at leaſt of his ordinary, if not to a degree more than an ordinary putting forth of himſelf and his gracious preſence with us. Thus then in the firſt place, if Reaſon or Conſcience do at any time, or in any particular caſe, luſt againſt, or oppoſe the fleſh, or corruption in man, they do it by means of the Spirit of God within them. For as there is an inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently an operation of the Spirit appropriate to the Saints or Believers; ſo there is an inhabitation (though of another kind. or upon other terms) of the ſame Spirit, which is common
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95016:57"/>to all thoſe that are not yet in the number of Believers. <label type="milestone">

               <p>Secondly, When Reaſon or Conſcience luſts againſt the Fleſh, only by ſuch an inſtigation or incitement hereunto of the Spirit of God, which is wont to proceed from him, when, and whilſt his dwelling is with men unregenerate, and according to the manner of his preſence here; this luſting againſt it is, firſt, but particular, only againſt ſome of the deſires, motions, and waies of it; others being diſpenſed with, as <hi>Herod's</hi> caſe was, (<hi>Mar.</hi> 6.20.) who did many things at the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> but ſome things (it ſeems) he would not do. By the maniture and help of the Spirit, he layed many channels of the fleſh dry, and turned the waters running there out of their courſe, but he ſuffered them to run elſewhere, and to have a vent or iſſue another way; and as it is often ſeen that a Tree, which is too luxuriant in bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, proſpers, and flouriſheth more, and bears more fruit when ſome of thoſe branches are lopt off; So the Fleſh many times being abridged of ſome of the wonted haunts and eruptions of it runs with the fuller and higher ſtream and tide, and rageth more ſome other way. This appears by ſeveral things upon record to have been the caſe of many Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; who by ſome Authors, in reſpect of many things commendable in them, are reported to have been very vertuous and worthy men; who yet are known by the obſervations and relations of others to have been vicious otherwiſe: So that the Fleſh careth not for ſuch luſters againſt it as Reaſon and Conſcience are. And concerning thoſe Heathen men we ſpeak of, many of them by what is extant upon good Record, though in reſpect of ſundry of their waies and courſes they were very excellent and worthy praiſe, yet they had their ſecret iſſues and vents for the fleſh, and thoſe corruptions which wrought effectually in them, and in a moſt notorious kind and fuller meaſure than in ordinary men. So that (as I ſay) the Fleſh ſuffers not much, is not in danger of being crucified by Reaſon and Conſcience, although theſe (in a ſenſe, and in reſpect of ſome of the beloved waies thereof) luſt againſt it. When they are put upon this luſting, and backed therein, only by the lighter and weaker puttings on by the Spirit, wherein he is wont to appear in perſons who have not attained an effectual or ſaving knowledge of God; it is not that body of the fleſh (as the Apoſtle calls it) but ſome members of it only upon which execution is done: Whereas the <hi>luſtings of the Spirit againſt the Fleſh</hi> in perſons that are regenerate, eſpecially when he is in his advance, and they filled with his preſence, are comprehenſive, and extend themſelves to all the avenues of the fleſh; yea, and ſeek, and attempt the very life of it, by ſtifling it, and ſtopping all the breathing paſſages and ſpirations of it, provoking and engaging ſuch men univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally to an utter abolition, to a through mortification of it. That of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. imports as much, <hi>Knowing this, that the old man is crucified, that the body of ſin might be deſtroyed, that henceforth we ſhould
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95016:58"/>not ſerve ſin.</hi> This is that which the Spirit luſteth after in the Saints, that is (according to a Rule not long ſince delivered) which he ſtirreth up in them, and prevails with them to luſt after, at leaſt when he fills the Temple of their Soul with the Glory of his Preſence, even to have the <hi>body,</hi> the whole and entire <hi>body of ſin</hi> deſtroyed; and not only here and there a member of this body maimed or diſabled, other members in the mean time remaining ſound and ſerviceable, that ſo the Saints <hi>might not ſerve ſin;</hi> meaning, in any of the ſervices thereof, or in any thing tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the eſtabliſhing, or advancement of the Kingdom, or power of it in the World.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> Thoſe luſtings againſt the Fleſh, which are found in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience, being only occaſioned and conceived in them by ſuch an inſpection or influence which the Spirit of God hath over, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts and conſciences of men yet in a ſtate of unbelief, are but faint and low ſpirited, eaſily check'd, quenched, and conjured down again by temptations, if they come in the way, like the goodneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, as it is in ſeveral places deſcribed in the Scriptures, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Judg.</hi> 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.35. to be like <hi>the morning cloud, and early dew.</hi> We know the morning cloud hath nothing but a kind of light ſubſtance in it, hath no body of rain in it. Thus it was with the <hi>Jews;</hi> as the early dew doth not continue, but is ſoon licked up with the Sun, becauſe it is but thin, and hath no root; ſo their goodneſs was but ſuperficial and ſlight, it had no depth in their hearts, like the Seed in the ſtony ground: It had no root in them, and ſo in a ſhort time came to nothing. We read in ſeveral places, that they could ſpeak of great matters that they would do, they would do all that the Lord would have them to do, they would ſerve the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you ſhall find that when any new Calamity came upon them, they were full of repentance, they would humble themſelves, and never provoke God more: But all this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they ſoon forgat God: For as ſoon as deliverance from their preſent trouble came, their goodneſs left them, they preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to their former folly. And in the fifth of <hi>John, John</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as our Saviour here deſcribeth him) <hi>a burning and ſhining light,</hi> their goodneſs held out in hearkening unto him <hi>for a ſeaſon,</hi> yea, and thus far they rejoyced in his light. But why did they not continue and hold out ſo to do? <hi>John's</hi> light was as <hi>burning</hi> and <hi>ſhining</hi> when they withdrew, and declined him, as before. How came it then to paſs that they did not continue to delight and rejoyce in him? The word they received from him had but little or no root in them: it lay but ſhallow in their judgments and ſouls. It is ſaid of the ſtony ground, that the ſeed which fell upon it withered away, becauſe it had no root: and the reaſon why it had no root, or none to any purpoſe, was becauſe it had not much earth upon it, (<hi>Mark</hi> 4.5. &amp; 6.16. compared) By which is ſignified, that the reaſon why the Goſpel, or Word of God, hath no faſter hold upon
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95016:58"/>the judgments and conſciences of men than commonly it hath, is, becauſe when they have heard it preached unto them, they do not (as it were) bury it under many ſerious thoughts, and much meditation beſtowed on it, but preſently betake themſelves to ſome worldly buſineſs, or elſe fall upon ſome impertinent diſcourſe; and ſo what they heard is never thought of more. How then ſhould it ſettle, or ſink to any great depth in their ſouls? And if men be not rooted and grounded in this knowledge of the truth, they are not like to walk in the practice of it long: a little occaſion will turn them aſide, they will ſoon loſe their goodneſs. So then, this is the caſe of thoſe luſtings againſt the fleſh which ſometimes appear in heathen men, they are powerleſs, ſeldom victorious, or long liv'd: Reaſon and Conſcience are ſoon bribed to keep ſilence. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may have ſuch caſes and inſtances among many Profeſſors of Chriſtianity amongſt us, that may at times have luſtings againſt the fleſh, and yet theſe ſoon vaniſh and wither, becauſe they have not any great root in themſelves (as our Saviour ſpeaks) they did not make a buſineſs of it to conſider the weight, and worth, and important concernment unto them to have their corruption and deeds of the fleſh more and more mortified. Now the truth is, there is no good action, nothing that doth concern men; there is no good diſpoſition, no good principle in the ſoul, no luſting againſt the fleſh at any time, in any man, but that if men would take a courſe accordingly, they might reduce the matter to ſuch a paſs that theſe good things ſhould never forſake them, but that they ſhould take poſſeſſion of them, and enjoy them continually. For weak and faint they commonly are at firſt in the beſt of men; but the reaſon why in good men they gather ſtrength, remain and hold out to the end, is, becauſe they have much earth in ſuch men, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they have good rooting: They have many ſerious thoughts beſtowed upon them, they are again and again conſidered and weighed in their minds: ſuch men digeſt buſineſſes of this nature between God and themſelves, contemplating, and feeding heartily upon the worth, and high conſequents of abounding in ſuch and ſuch holy diſpoſitions and practices, and continuing in them. When ſuch a practical reſolution as this comes to be incorporated in the heart, then it continues and abides in men: now they will not regard any voice behind them from the fleſh, to gratifie themſelves in any ſinful or unworthy kind. But this by the way.</p>
               <p>Now the luſtings againſt the fleſh which the Spirit of God is wont to ſtir up in holy men, that are <hi>filled</hi> with him, are potent and ſtrong; they will not (ordinarily) admit of parties, nor ſtand to diſpute with temptations: No, but will ſet them on fire to proſecute the fleſh, and to purſue and follow the victory againſt it, until it be brought low, and ſhall have little liſt or heart to ſtir, or move, or be any further trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome unto them. It is true, there are very few that attain to any ſuch
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95016:59"/>luſtings againſt the fleſh as theſe,; few whoſe luſtings are ſo ſtrong, and potent, and glorious. The reaſon is, becauſe there is not one of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand that grows up to the ſtate or ſtature of a perfect man in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> (I ſpeak of that perfection which the Scripture often aſcribes unto men, and of which we are all capable.) But alas! my Brethren, we are vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Dwarfs, and love to keep our ſelves babes in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> we are loath to go to the price, to be at the coſt and charges of any thing that is ſpiritual, excellent, and glorious. Indeed, it is an unworthy principle, and it is to be feared that there is a touch and tincture, if not the whole body and element of it in the hearts of far the greater part of us, <hi>viz.</hi> that if we can but poſſeſs our ſelves of ſo much Grace, and ſuch a Faith, which will be ſufficient at laſt to ſave us, we need care for no more; as if herein lay the high ſtrain, and excellency of wiſdom in men, not to do more to be ſaved than is of abſolute neceſſity to be done; or to enjoy as much of the pleaſures or profits of ſin as is poſſible to be enjoyed without being damned, and ſo to order, rank, and couple both Worlds toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to drive them both before them: eſteeming thoſe, who trouble themſelves, and <hi>labour</hi> more than they themſelves do, <hi>for the meat that endureth to eternal life,</hi> no whit wiſer than thoſe who over-by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and to whom in that reſpect men are wont to apply that Proverb of diſparagement; <hi>A fool and his money are ſoon parted.</hi> But (my Brethren) as it was ſaid to the <hi>Jews</hi> in another caſe, <hi>If you will not believe, you ſhall not be eſtabliſhed,</hi> Iſa. 7.9. So if men will not weigh, and conſider, and believe that it is better for them, that both their feet ſtand upon the World to come, that their hearts, affections, and deſires were wholy removed from the Earth, and from this preſent World; they will never be able to do any great things for God, or for their own ſouls; their hands will never be ſteady in their liftings up unto thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, in the keeping whereof there is the greateſt reward. Some pretend and plead, that whilſt they are men they muſt be ſubject to infirmities, and there will be miſcarriages; and therefore ſince it will be ſo, they care not how many they be: They think it not worth the while to ſtrive to reduce themſelves into as narrow a compaſs of ſinning as fleſh is able to keep or move in; but without much regret or care di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide themſelves between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Belial,</hi> between righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs, between things preſent and things that are to come. And ſo the truth is, they do enjoy only a kind of compounded life, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in an eſtate wherein Heaven and Earth are (as it were) mingled together, and many times they are ſtung and pierced through with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and ſorrows in reſpect of both. For firſt, they can attain unto no ſtability, or well-grounded comfort, or hope in God; becauſe their hearts are not entire and perfect with him. And ſecondly, many times that which they do, or deſire to do, in matters relating to Salvation, is troubleſome unto them; and incumbers them, becauſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95016:59"/>in this preſent World: And ſo between the one and the other they enjoy themſelves in neither. Whereas, if they would diſcharge their hearts from all inordinate and impertinent luſtings after the things of this preſent World, and remove their joy and delight into the World which is to come, then they would be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.4.) they would have (as it were) their poſſeſſion entire, they would have their inheritance round about them on every ſide, and would be compleatly happy: Neither would they complain in the leaſt of any loſs they ſuſtained by withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their carnal intereſt, from the importune delights, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and great things of this preſent World. Thus you ſee upon a rational debate of the matter, that it is impoſſible, without the Spirit of God, yea, without being <hi>filled</hi> with this <hi>Spirit,</hi> that men ſhould ever riſe to any capacity of being filled with the rich and lively Conſolations of the Goſpel.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> Every man is therefore bound to <hi>be filled with the Spirit of God;</hi> that ſo he may be capable of the fulleſt and higheſt rewards that God holdeth forth to the Sons and Daughters of men, to provoke them to waies and works of greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and worth. In this Reaſon there are two things ſuppoſed, and one affirmed; the two particulars ſuppoſed are theſe: Firſt, That the rewards, which God holds out to invite and incourage men unto
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95016:60"/>holineſs and worthineſs of Converſation, are different in their reſpective values and degrees. Or (if you pleaſe) thus: As ſome may do <hi>well,</hi> and others do <hi>better</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.38.) ſo may ſome men be well rewarded by God for well-doing, and yet others be more graciouſly, or more bountifully rewarded by him for doing better. The other thing ſuppoſed is this, That every man ſtands bound in duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God to render himſelf capable of the richeſt and greateſt reward which God judgeth meet to confer upon any man. The thing affirmed in the Reaſon is this; That without being <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> men will never be found in a capacity of being thus rewarded; (I mean with the higheſt and richeſt rewards which God hath in ſtore for men) Let us with all the brevity that may be ſhew you all theſe from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. For the firſt, That God intends the Collation of greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards upon thoſe, who ſhall <hi>abound in the work of the Lord</hi> more than others, is clearly laid down in the Scriptures from place to place. But this I ſay (ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>) 2 Cor. 9.6. <hi>He which ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly, and he which ſoweth bountifully ſhall reap bountifully.</hi> Whether we underſtand this place of temporal, or ſpiritual rewards, or both, of reaping in this life, or in that which is to come, it is of the ſame import thus far: It plainly proves an intent and purpoſe in God, to reward thoſe more liberally than other men, who ſhall quit themſelves in well-doing accordingly. As he rewarded <hi>Phineas</hi> the Son of <hi>Eleazer,</hi> for that zealous act of his in executing judgment upon <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cozby,</hi> by which he turned away his wrath from the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (<hi>Num.</hi> 25.10, 11, 12.) above the rate of other godly perſons in the ſame Generation with him. And if God put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the different walkings and ſervices of men in matters of reward relating to this preſent life, Why ſhould we not conceive that he doth the like, if not much more, in the life and world to come, at leaſt in reſpect of ſuch perſons, whoſe ſignal Faithfulneſs unto him hath not been ſignally recompenſed before death? Which is the caſe (generally) of thoſe who are faithful unto death for righteouſneſs ſake, or for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the truth. The Saints of old, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. are ſaid <hi>not</hi> to have <hi>accepted deliverance,</hi> when they were tortured (meaning when it was offered them upon unworthy terms, or elſe not to have accepted it, that is, not much to have deſired or minded it) <hi>that they might obtain and receive the better Reſurrection;</hi> that is, the better ſtate and condition in the Reſurrection, that they might riſe again with ſo much the more glory. <hi>There is one glory</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>of the Sun, and another glory of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars. For one ſtar differeth from another ſtar in glory; So alſo is the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41. meaning, that there will be a proportionable inequality in the glory and bleſſedneſs of the Saints in the Reſurrection. This exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or redundance of reward that we ſpeak of, is clearly held forth
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95016:60"/>in the Parable of the Talents delivered out by the Maſter unto ſeveral Servants, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. And there is this reaſon why it ſhould be ſo, as we have now preſented the caſe unto you, why God ſhould reward ſome above the line of others, ſuppoſing (that which we all know to be true) an inequality among the Saints in zeal, and ſervice, and faithfulneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God (<hi>viz.</hi>) becauſe though the Collation, or beſtowing of eternal life upon the Saints, be, in one reſpect, an act of free grace and bounty in God; in which reſpect it is ſaid to be the gift of God, and that which is conferred in this kind upon them, is ſometimes termed a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> which may be the ſame, where ſervices have been different, if the Donor pleaſeth; yet in another reſpect, this Act of God we ſpeak of is an Act of juſtice, of diſtributive, or remunerative juſtice, and ſo moſt frequently repreſented in the Scriptures; and conſequently, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity proceed, and be carried according to all the variety, and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of worth, and excellency that ſhall be found in the waies, and works, and ſervices of all thoſe that ſhall be rewarded. How, and in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that Act of God, we ſpeak of, is an Act of Free Grace, or Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in what reſpect again, an Act of Juſtice, we ſhall not now ſtand to declare; becauſe we deſire to haſten: upon which account alſo we ſhall (at preſent) forbear the anſwering of ſuch objections, or diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which ſeem to lye againſt, and to incumber the Doctrine of ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of rewards in glory. <label type="milestone">

               <p>Only we ſhall deſire your patience to ſpeak a word or two for the clearing of the ſaid Doctrine from having any thing in it contrary to the ſcope of our Saviour in that Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. where thoſe that were hired at ſeveral hours of the day to labour in the Vineyard, ſome early in the morning, ſome at the third hour, ſome at the ſixth, ſome at the ninth, and ſome at the eleventh, are ſaid notwithſtanding to receive every man a <hi>Penny.</hi> This Parable is ſo interpreted, and underſtood by ſome, as if it held forth ſuch a Doctrine as this, and implied, that all true Believers, and all true Servants of God ſhall be equally rewarded by God: and as if this was the principle drift of it. For anſwer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:</p>
               <p>Firſt, I confeſs (and Interpreters generally acknowledge the ſame with me) that the Parable is of a very difficult interpretation, and that it is hard to draw all the parts and paſſages of it to a clear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance or Coherence with that which is expreſſed to be the drift, intent, and ſcope of it. But, ſecondly, it is a true rule (and is delivered fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by Expoſitors) That though there be ſome reaſon, and ſome uſe of every clauſe and member of every Scripture Parable, yet every clauſe and member is not neceſſarily or eſſentially relative to that which is the main ſcope or drift of it, as if this could not ſtand, or be made out without them, or as if every clauſe were to be interpreted with a ſpecial accommodation to it. In moſt Parables there are ſome paſſages
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95016:61"/>that ſerve only as <hi>Emblemata,</hi> Embelliſhments, or Ornaments unto them, which make them both more pleaſant to read and conſider; and beſides, help the memory the better to carry away the intire Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or Story of the Parable, being much of the ſame uſe in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Diſcourſes, which ſome kind of Pictures, and antique works is in Maps. Theſe do not concern the principle uſe of the Map, which is to ſhew the Forms, Compaſs, Situations, Climates, Names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Countries and Places, but only to gratifie the Fancy, and make the Map ſeem more delightſome. And if they that uſe Maps thus beautified, and ſet out, will needs draw Concluſions for their inſtruction from theſe by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts of their Maps, as from the ſtrange Forms of Fiſhes, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, which they find painted here and there in the vacant places thereof, they may very poſſibly deceive themſelves, and judge that to be meant by him, that made the Map, which was never intended by him: In like manner there are, or may be Clauſes in Parabolical Narrations that ſerve to make up the Sentence, to make it an entire Story and body of Diſcourſe, when they have not any eſſential Connexion with, or relation to that which is the main end of the Parable. And it is a paſſage of <hi>Calvin</hi> in his Explication of the Parable in hand, <hi>Siquis exactè ſingulas hujus Parabolae partes diſcutere velit, inepta erit ejus curi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitas:</hi> If ſo be any man will undertake to diſcuſs and examine every part of this Parable, it will be found to ſavour more of Curioſity, than of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety or wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> As concerning the ſcope and intent of the Parable, <hi>Calvin</hi> (doubtleſs) is in the right, both as to the Negative, and Affirmative, in both which moſt likewiſe of the beſt Expoſitors agree with him, though ſome few diſſent; but for the Negative, he expreſſeth himſelf thus, <hi>Atquinec diſputat Chriſtus, vel de Coeleſtis gloriae aequalitate, vel de fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo Piorum ſtatu:</hi> But Chriſt in this Parable doth not diſpute, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning an equality or inequality of rewards of Saints in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nor doth he at all relate to the future condition of godly men after this life. And for the Affirmative he ſaith, <hi>Haec Parabola nihil aliud eſt, quàm proximae ſententiae confirmatio; Erunt primi noviſſimi, &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſimi primi:</hi> This Parable is nothing elſe but only a confirmation of that Sentence which did immediately precede, contained in the laſt words of the foregoing Chapter. <hi>But many that are laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt laſt.</hi> Therefore this Parable muſt be ſo interpreted, that it may be a convenient proof, or a rational Explication of this Concluſion or Saying, <hi>Many that are firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt ſhall be firſt.</hi> Now, it is true, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this Saying (and ſo in the Explication and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it) had a further End than ſimply the aſſertion of, or the poſſeſſing of his Diſciples, or others, with the truth of that Saying; <hi>viz.</hi> effectually to excite, ſtir up, and admoniſh both the one and the other to hold on and perſevere in the waies of righteouſneſs and well-doing,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95016:61"/>if at any time their feet were ſlipping; conſidering, that though they were, or ſhould be before others in the Profeſſion of the truth, either in time, or enjoyment of means, or in zeal and fervency of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, yet they might through pride, careleſneſs, and ſecurity, be thrown back behind many, who were at firſt, and for a time far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and in whom, for a long time, nothing of God, or of any goodneſs appeared. This (I ſay) was our Saviours drift in his inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and backing this Saying, with ſo much importunity, into the hearts and conſciences of his Apoſtles, and others; and conſequently, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote intent of the Parable it ſelf. But that which is the more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and proper ſcope of it, is, to give ſome further light to that ſaying, <hi>Many that are firſt ſhall be laſt: and the laſt ſhall be firſt.</hi> Now, that this is the proper and immediate end of this Parable is evident, both from the beginning of the Parable, and likewiſe from the Application and winding up, or end of it in <hi>Verſe</hi> 14. In the beginning of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that rationative Particle, <hi>For; For the Kingdom of Heaven is like,</hi> &amp;c. clearly ſheweth that the Parable (in the words following) doth relate to that which went immediately before; and (indeed) it was not ſo well conſidered by him (whoever he was) that made the beginning of this Chapter here: For this Parable ſhould have gone along with the former words, being the Explication, or an account given of what was delivered there, that <hi>the firſt ſhall be laſt,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the cloſe, or winding up of this paſſage, which is (as it were) the Application of it, <hi>Ver.</hi> 16. <hi>So the laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt laſt: for many be called, but few choſen.</hi> So that by all this diſcourſe in this Parable you may eaſily gather that it will come ſo to paſs, that <hi>many, that are laſt, ſhall be firſt: and the firſt, laſt.</hi> But thirdly (and laſtly) the Queſtion is, How the main Current of the Parable can be drawn to run in this Channel; or in what ſenſe this Saying, <hi>The firſt ſhall be laſt,</hi> can be underſtood to make the natural reſult of the Parable, or to make this Parable to be the confirmation, or illuſtration of it?</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is to be conſidered, that this Saying, <hi>The firſt ſhall be laſt,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> 
                  <hi>and the laſt firſt,</hi> was a Proverbial kind of Sentence frequently uſed amongſt the Jews. <hi>Grotius</hi> calls it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>tritam uſu communi,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.30. a Sentence worn with common uſage. Many Sayings and Sentences of this kind (I mean, which paſſed familiarly, and in the nature of Proverbs, amongſt the Perſons with whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) were taken up by him, and upon occaſion inſerted into his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly diſcourſings unto them, The Reaſon whereof we ſhall not here ſtand to conſider: but for the truth of the obſervation ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.12. &amp; 12.37. &amp; 13.57. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.37. (to omit others.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is obſerved by many (and the obſervation is true and pertinent to the preſent occaſion) that Proverbial Sayings have (very
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95016:62"/>frequently) different ſenſes, and may be, and are accordingly applied unto different caſes. <hi>Proverbium vulgare aptavit ad praeſentem Cauſam, Chriſtus verò ad ſenſum Paulò diverſum inflectit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Calvin</hi> in Mat. 12.37. <hi>Solent Proverbiales Sententiae variis modis aptari,</hi> Hugo Grotius in <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.16. Inſtances hereof might be given. For,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This very ſaying, <hi>The firſt ſhall be laſt, and the laſt firſt,</hi> may be underſtood either in a more general and comprehenſive ſenſe, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all kinds, or any kind of priority; together with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons poſſeſt of, or enjoying any priority in one kind or other; and ſo <hi>laſtneſs,</hi> or worſtneſs, in eſtate, or condition, as well in one kind as another, together with the perſons reduced to any ſuch condition; or elſe in a more particular and reſtrained ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> importing only a <hi>firſtneſs,</hi> or precedency before others in matters of Religion, and things appertaining unto God; together with the perſons inveſted at preſent with the priviledge of ſuch a precedency; and ſo a <hi>laſtneſs,</hi> oppoſite to ſuch a priority, or precedency, together with the perſons either preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, or reduced to this <hi>laſtneſs,</hi> or poorneſs of condition. Again, admitting this reſtrained ſenſe, yet the meaning of the Saying may be, either that the <hi>firſt</hi> (in this ſenſe) ſhall or will prove ſo ſecure, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and unworthy in their way, that they will be caſt behind thoſe that ſometimes were far behind them in their ſpiritual eſtate, yet not ſo as wholly to Apoſtatize, or make ſhipwrack of Faith, or not to be ſaved in the end; and ſo that they that were ſometimes nothing, or worſe than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in things relating unto God, ſhall before they die quit themſelves at ſuch a worthy rate of wiſdom, zeal, and diligence, in approving themſelves unto God, that they ſhall obtain a greater intereſt in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and love than thoſe that had been highly intereſſed in theſe long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they began to look after them; or elſe (the meaning may be) that thoſe that were at firſt, and for a time zealouſly forward in good waies, will afterwards ſuffer themſelves to be ſo enticed away from them by the World, and by the Fleſh, as to make ſhipwrack of all, and of Salvation it ſelf at the laſt: Whereas many, who for a long time walked in the paths of Death, and ſavoured not in the leaſt the things of God, ſhall at laſt lay hold (as it were) with both their hands on eternal life. Beſides, the Proverbial Saying we ſpeak of may be underſtood of Nations, or greater Communities of People, in their ſucceeding Ages, and Generations, as well as of particular or individual perſons, ſo as to import, that ſuch Nations, Cities, or Countries, who embraced the true Worſhip and Service of God before others, or with greater zeal and vigour of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, many times after a while fall from their firſt love, and ſuffer others, other Cities, or Countries, even thoſe who had been a long time without God in the World, to take away their Crown. And in this ſenſe we find it uſed by our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.30. and applied to the National Apoſtacy, and rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who alone, for many Ages paſt,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95016:62"/>of all the Nations on the earth, had a zeal for the true God, and profeſſed his true Worſhip;) and to the gracious entertainment of the Gentiles by God for his people upon their free and cordial entertainment of the Goſpel. But,</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) in which of the ſenſes mentioned the Parable of the Penny (which our engagement is to reconcile with the Point in hand, the different advancement of the Saints in glory by God) may be conceived to be the confirmation, or illuſtration of it (as by the conſent of almoſt all Expoſitors it is, and by the expreſs tenour of the Context muſt needs be, as hath already been proved) and how it may be interpreted ſo as not to favour that equality of the Saints in glory, which ſome main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hath yet ſome difficulty in it. Yea, thoſe Expoſitors, who unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly conclude that it holds no intelligence, or correſpondency with that opinion, are yet much divided in their judgments about the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of it, and the ſenſe of ſeveral paſſages in it. I ſhall not trouble you with the variety of their notions in this kind; but briefly acquaint you with mine own, and with what I judge moſt agreeable unto the truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> I ſuppoſe the Parable in hand to be an Explication or proof of the Saying, <hi>Many that are firſt ſhall be laſt,</hi> &amp;c. taken in the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſenſe of the two mentioned, and that the tendency of it is to declare and ſhew, that many, who in matters of Religion, and in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges depending hereon, were, (in one ſenſe or other, <hi>viz.</hi> either in reality and truth, or in their own opinion) before others, would yet be found at laſt far inferiour in both unto thoſe, in reſpect of whom they had formerly a ſignal preheminency in both, and that theſe, in the iſſue, would have the Crown of their preheminence, or precedency, awarded, and given unto them. This (I preſume) the expreſs tenour of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable maketh manifeſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is not to be queſtioned but that our Saviour in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable did overture, and inſinuate (at leaſt) the rejection of the <hi>Jews</hi> (plainly enough characterized by thoſe that were firſt called into the Vineyard, who only are ſaid to have been hired by expreſs Compact for <hi>a Penny a day,</hi> and to have murmured againſt him that hired them for not valuing their work above theirs, who were called into work after them, and laboured not ſo long as they; both ſymptomes of a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> temper) together with the receiving of the Gentiles into grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God, ſignified by thoſe that were called into the Vineyard after the others (though not all at the ſame time, but ſome after others, as we know the Gentiles in their reſpective Countries and Cities were called) as likewiſe by their greater ingenuity and more Evangelical tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than were found in the other, in that they did not indent with the Houſholder (God) for any certain wages, or hire, but were content to refer themſelves, for their work and labour, unto his good will and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:95016:63"/>pleaſure. It was the manner of <hi>Chriſt</hi> rather to inſinuate ſomewhat darkly, and covertly, unto the <hi>Jews</hi> their approaching rejection, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the calling of the Gentiles, than to declare it openly, or in plainneſs of words. In the following Chapter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.45. <hi>Luke</hi> 20.19. It is ſaid, that <hi>when the chief Prieſts and Phariſees had heard his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, they perceived that he ſpake of them</hi> [meaning, of them and their Nation.] <hi>They perceived,</hi> that is (as we uſe to ſay) they ſmelt fire; they had a ſtrong jealouſie, and ſomewhat more, that the perſons or people againſt whom his Parables were bent were they and their Nation. Therefore,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas it is ſaid, that the firſt hired likewiſe <hi>received every man a penny</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> as the others had done) it is not to be ſuppoſed, that thoſe ſignified by them received the ſame recompenſe of reward from God (eſpecially if by the <hi>Penny</hi> they received, we underſtand the Kingdom of Heaven) which the other Labourers had received. For there is no murmuring againſt God, nor envying of their Fellows amongſt the Saints in their Heavenly Kingdom; a Conſideration ſtrongly inſiſted on by <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> among the Ancients, and <hi>Muſculus</hi> (with ſome others) amongſt our modern Expoſitors to prove, that the word <hi>Penny</hi> doth not ſignifie one and the ſame thing, that is, [materially, or in the Letter] where ever it is uſed in the Parable, but the ſame thing in proportion only, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch a recompenſe, or reward, which according to the rules of equity anſwereth the nature, quality, and proportion of every mans work, whether it be good, and ſo rewardable with glory; or whether it be evil, and ſo rewardable with ſhame and puniſhment: And again, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be more conſiderably good, and ſo according to equity rewardable with more glory; or more demeritoriouſly evil, and ſo upon the ſame account rewardable with the greater puniſhment. This Notion of the word <hi>Penny</hi> is countenanced by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. which properly ſignifieth <hi>wages,</hi> being here uſed as parallel to it, and explicative of it. <hi>When Even was come, the Lord of the Vineyard ſaith unto his Steward, Call the Labourers,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and give them their wages.</hi> Now, as it is not unuſual in the Scripture to expreſs the puniſhment, which is due unto ſin, by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>wages, recompenſe,</hi> or <hi>reward,</hi> as well as the <hi>glory, honour,</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> which are due by Promiſe and Covenant from God unto righteouſneſs and well-doing. <hi>For the wages of ſin is death, Rom.</hi> 6.23. So again, <hi>Receiving,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſe</hi> [or wages] <hi>of their errour which was meet,</hi> Rom. 1.27. And <hi>every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience received,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recompenſe of reward,</hi> Heb. 2.2. (to omit other places.) That likewiſe is further obſervable to our preſent purpoſe, that the Holy Ghoſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſeth the ſame word, not only in the ſame Contexture of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but even in the ſame Sentence, to ſignifie things that are only Analogically, or in proportion the ſame, and not the ſame properly,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95016:63"/>or ſpecifically, <hi>Neque novum eſt, ut idem nomen, quem admodum hîc</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>duobus ſenſibus ſerviat,</hi> Grotius, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.29. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let the dead bury their dead,</hi> (Luke 9.60.) By <hi>dead</hi> in the latter place, he meaneth ſuch as were properly, and in a more common acceptation of the word <hi>dead:</hi> But in the former place, ſuch who were Analogically, and by way of reſemblance only, <hi>dead.</hi> So, by the <hi>water,</hi> of which he ſpeaks, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.13. he means material or common <hi>water:</hi> but by the ſame word in the next verſe, he meaneth <hi>water</hi> of a quite different nature, and that which is ſuch only by way of ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or proportion. It were eaſie to add more inſtances of this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of ſpeaking in the Scripture, if it were needful. Therefore</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When thoſe that were firſt hired are ſaid to have murmured againſt the Lord of the Vineyard, not becauſe he had puniſhed them, but only becauſe he had made thoſe that were hired after them (and therefore, as they thought, had both laboured leſs, and ſo deſerved leſs than they) <hi>equal</hi> [in reward] unto them; it is to be conſtrued and underſtood only as an Hypotypoſis, or lively repreſentation of the evil and malignant <hi>genius</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> [and in part, of all Juſticiaries like unto them who ſtand upon terms of Merit, or Works, with God, for their juſtification] againſt the Gentiles, and their entertainment by God for his people. This was a ſcourge in their ſides, and a thorn in their eyes; they looked upon it as a ſore puniſhment inflicted upon them by God, or at leaſt, as very hard meaſure meaſured unto them; that People ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and deſpicable in their eyes, yea, ſo hated and abominated by them, as the Gentiles were, ſhould be made equal unto them in their great and darling priviledge, (I mean) their being the People of God; a Priviledge whereof they and their Forefathers had been in poſſeſſion for ſo many Generations. That this was as a Sword paſſing through their Soul, and a burthen next to inſupportable unto them, the Scripture wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth in ſeveral places. God himſelf of old propheſied, and deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Calling of the Gentiles, as a penal requital (and this very ſharp and ſore) upon the <hi>Jews</hi> for their Idolatries, and other contempt of him. <hi>They have moved me to jealouſie with that which is not God, they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealouſie with thoſe which are not a People; I will provoke them to anger with a fooliſh Nation, Deut.</hi> 32.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.19. The like is obſervable from <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.10. compared with <hi>verſe</hi> 11. The Holy Ghoſt likewiſe maketh obſervation (<hi>Acts</hi> 22.) that the <hi>Jews</hi> gave audience unto <hi>Paul</hi> (in his Apology) with ſome patience unto theſe words, <hi>And he</hi> [God] <hi>ſaid unto me, depart: for I will ſend thee far hence unto the Gentiles;</hi> but that upon theſe words, <hi>They lift up their voices, and ſaid, Away with ſuch a Fellow from the Earth; for it is not fit that he ſhould live. And as they cried out and caſt off their Cloaths, and threw duſt in the dir,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 22, 23. Theſe deportments of theirs, the occaſion conſidered, plainly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95016:64"/>ſhew, that Gods mercy and goodneſs towards the Gentiles in making them equal unto them [the <hi>Jews</hi>] in their reception into grace and favour with him, and making them his People, was interpreted and reſented by them as a juſt ground, or occaſion of murmuring, or complaining even againſt God himſelf, as a thing unequal, and unworthy of him, in caſe he ſhould do it.</p>
               <p>And if we ſhould underſtand, or conceive, that becauſe the firſt hired are ſaid to have <hi>received likewiſe every man a Penny,</hi> and ſo to have been made <hi>equal</hi> unto thoſe that were hired afterwards, that therefore they received the ſame Salvation with them, or were made <hi>equal</hi> to them in this, there will be nothing at all found in the whole Parable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this Reaſon. <hi>For many are called, but few choſen,</hi> given by <hi>Chriſt</hi> (in the Apodoſis or Application of it) of that Doctrinal Concluſion (intended, as hath been ſaid, to be declared or illuſtrated by it) <hi>The laſt ſhall be firſt, and the firſt laſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. Evident it is, that by <hi>the firſt,</hi> here ſaid to become, or to be made <hi>laſt,</hi> are meant thoſe upon whom this puniſhment or miſery ſhould fall, by means of their not being <hi>choſen</hi> [that is, approved by God as meet to be rewarded with eternal life.]</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that any of the after Called (in the Parable) became <hi>laſt,</hi> through any ſuch defect as this, or otherwiſe, but that they were all <hi>choſen</hi> and approved by God, and graciouſly rewarded by him, though not equally neither (as we ſhall ſhew further preſently.) Therefore by the <hi>Penny,</hi> which the firſt hired received, cannot be meant the Kingdom of Heaven, or Salvation, nor yet the ſame thing, or the ſame reward (materially taken) with the <hi>Penny</hi> received by thoſe that were called afterwards.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If by the word <hi>Penny,</hi> by which is expreſſed that <hi>wages</hi> or conſideration which all the reſpective Labourers, at what time ſoever called, are ſaid to have received for their labour (reſpectively) ſhould be meant the Kingdom of Heaven, or the great reward of Salvation; yet neither will it follow from hence, that therefore they were equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, or that they had equal ſhares in this Kingdom. All the twelve Tribes were ſafely brought into the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (the well-known Type of Heaven) and were planted, and dwelt in it: yet had they not all equal proportions of the Land aſſigned unto them for their (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective) Poſſeſſions or Inheritances: Yea, it is ſcarce queſtionable, but that every one of their ſeveral allotments differed more or leſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs or extent of Territory from all the reſt. There is nothing more uſual in the new Teſtament than to promiſe the recompenſe of reward unto all that ſhall perſevere in Faith and Love unto the end, under the ſame terms, or expreſſions, as ſometimes of life, ſometimes of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, ſometimes of a Kingdom, of a Kingdom that cannot be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken (beſides many the like) yet by other places (ſome of which we
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95016:64"/>ſhall conſider ere long) it plainly appeareth, that there ſhall be ſome greater, and ſome leſſer in theſe heavenly enjoyments. Every Labourer may receive his <hi>Penny:</hi> and yet the <hi>Penny</hi> received by one may have more Silver in it, and be more weighty upon the Ballance than that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by another: although it is to be preſumed that the lighteſt of all is full weight; not only, or not ſo much, according to the ſtandard of equity, but of the greateſt and moſt magnificent bounty.

To the former he ſaid, <hi>Go ye alſo into the Vineyard,</hi>

                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Ver.</hi> 4.7. By theſe expreſſions it is manifeſt, that though in his expoſtulation with thoſe that murmured, he ſaith, <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ver.</hi> 15. Yet he did proceed by a rule of righteouſneſs, or equity in rewarding all thoſe that wrought in his Vineyard. And proceeding by this rule in rewarding, he <hi>did with his own</hi> what he <hi>willed,</hi> or pleaſed to <hi>do:</hi> for his <hi>Will</hi> was to do that which is <hi>right,</hi> meet, or equitable in rewarding the labours of his Servants. But now it is not equitable, right, or meet, that he that laboureth more, with equal, and eſpecially with greater faithfulneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Maſter, ſhould in his reward be reduced to the proportion of him that laboureth leſs, or with leſs faithfulneſs. So that unleſs it ſhall be ſuppoſed (which, I preſume, is no man's ſuppoſal) that all the Saints are uniformly, or equally diligent, and faithful, and zealous in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of God; it cannot be ſuppoſed that God, who rewardeth them all by a rule of proportion, or according to what is <hi>right</hi> or meet, ſhould reward them all alike, and not conſider thoſe that have abounded in his work above thoſe that have been more ſparing and remiſs in it. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Sixthly (and laſtly, to add this alſo) The reaſon why the Lord of the Vineyard gives order unto his Steward to <hi>give the Labourers their hire, beginning from the laſt unto the firſt</hi> (<hi>v.</hi> 8.) may be to ſignifie, that the heart of God is more ſet upon thoſe, who after long continuance and obdura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in waies of ſin and wickedneſs, yet unfeignedly repent, and turn unto him at the laſt, than upon thoſe that have been trained from their youth up in his ſervice, though they have not declined from it. This diſpoſition
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95016:65"/>in God, our Saviour ſeteth forth by ſeveral Parables in the Goſpel, as of the joy for the <hi>loſt ſheep that was found,</hi> Luke 15.6.

Upon this account it is, that (as the Lord <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who perfectly underſtood the temper and diſpoſition of Heaven, informeth us) <hi>there is more joy in Heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, than over ninety and nine juſt perſons, that need no repentance.</hi> And again, that <hi>there is joy in the preſence of the Angels of God over one ſinner that repenteth,</hi> (Luke 15.7.10.) Doubtleſs, the joy that is before the Angels of God ariſeth proportionably to that contentment, joy, or ſatisfaction-which they obſerve in God himſelf, either upon his own, or his Creatures acting, to his glory.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> But how doth it ſtand with that Rule of Equity, according unto which you lately taught us that God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies rewardeth his Saints and Servants, that his heart ſhould be more ſet upon rewarding thoſe that have of a long time done him the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt diſſervice, and provoked him to his face, only becauſe at laſt they repent, and do him ſome ſervice for a ſhort time, than thoſe that have ſerved him in righteouſneſs and true holineſs all the daies of their life?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; That ſuch a diſpoſition in God as this (with his actings ſutable to it) is no waies inconſiſtent with the ſtricteſt Rule of Equity in rewarding. Only this is to be known, and conſidered by the way; that he doth not alwaies, or in all caſes without exception, walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, but only for the moſt part, or more generally. As any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular diſpoſition in a perſon truly prudent and wiſe, though never ſo ſtrong, may by ſome extraordinary circumſtance intervening be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times over-ruled. Our Saviour himſelf ſeems to intimate ſome ſuch caution, or reſtriction as that now hinted, in that method of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in God about the rewarding of his Saints, according to which he maketh; the <hi>laſt, firſt</hi> (and conſequently, the <hi>firſt, laſt</hi>) or giveth order to have the <hi>laſt</hi> called, to be rewarded in the <hi>firſt</hi> place. For when he ſaith, <hi>Many that are firſt ſhall be laſt,</hi> he ſeemeth to ſuppoſe, that it will not univerſally ſo prove, or that all (without exception) <hi>that are firſt ſhall be laſt,</hi> but that for the moſt part it will be ſo. So again, where he ſaith, <hi>There are laſt that ſhall be firſt, and there are firſt that ſhall be laſt</hi> (Luke 13.30.) he implyeth, that there may be ſome <hi>laſt</hi> who ſhall not be <hi>firſt:</hi> and ſo, that there may be ſome <hi>firſt</hi> that ſhall not be <hi>laſt.</hi> The reaſon hereof we ſhall ſhew preſently. This caution pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, the equity of Gods proceedings in making the laſt-called of his Saints the firſt in their reward (ordinarily) may be demonſtrated upon theſe four grounds.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:95016:65"/>
               <p>Firſt, Thoſe that have been great ſinners, and have ſtood out long in rebellion againſt God, when their great evil is overcome by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in the Goſpel, and they, notwithſtanding all their wretched and fierce Provocations, are received into grace and favour with him, only upon their repentance and believing, commonly prove the greateſt and moſt cordial friends unto him amongſt all his Saints, become moſt naturally and genuinely affected towards him, are moſt free and willing to ſpend, and to be ſpent upon the ſervice of his name and glory: Whereas old diſciples, and thoſe that of a long time, and from their youth have been accuſtomed to the yoke of Religion, are apt, in proceſs of time, to grow drowſie, and next unto formal and cuſtomary in their performances: and ſeldom have that courage, that ſpirit and life in them, to act any thing, or ſuffer any thing out of courſe, or upon any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary account, for the intereſt of God, and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the World, which are found in late Converts, and thoſe that come off from many and great abominations unto God. The longer, and harder the Earth hath been bound by a Froſt, the mellower, and more tender and capable of any impreſſion it is found when a through thaw cometh: No heart ſo pliable under the Word, Spirit, or Intereſt of God as that which is made ſoft by him after the greateſt hardneſs. The Scripture beareth witneſs unto this, as a truth, in many inſtances and places. He, who by his own confeſſion (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.) was the <hi>greateſt of ſinners,</hi> whilſt unconverted, when the evil property of his heart was altered by the Grace of God, Laboured in his ſervice <hi>more abundantly than they all</hi> (than all his fellow Apoſtles) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. That which is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> Luke 19.7.8. and of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> (though her name be not mentioned) <hi>Luke</hi> 7. from <hi>ver.</hi> 37, to 48. gives a lightſome evidence of truth in the Notion in hand, and that Saying of <hi>Chriſt, To whom little is forgiven, he loveth little,</hi> with his diſcourſe preceding, doth abundantly confirm it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They who have long, and even unto wearineſs, and to the brink of deſpair, walked in the vanity of their minds, and waies of wickedneſs, being upon repentance received unto mercy, commonly prove more Evangelical in the frame of their minds, and temper of their ſpirits, and cleave unto God with a more pure and entire dependence upon his grace in <hi>Chriſt</hi> for their Juſtification, and Salvation, than they that are Profeſſors of a long ſtanding, and were early at work in the Vineyard. It is very incident unto theſe, after ſome years continuance in a religious courſe, to be inſenſibly corrupted in their minds from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, and to warp towards a ſpirit of legality, aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating (as it were) their own Righteouſneſs with the Grace of God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to keep up their hearts in hope of Juſtification by him. This difference between the one and the other, in the ſpirit of their minds, was (doubtleſs) intimated by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the different behaviours, or
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95016:66"/>expreſſions of the Prodigal or younger Brother, who perſonates the late Convert or the perſon that after much wickedneſs returns unto God, and upon his Converſion, and of the Elder Brother, who ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the <hi>Genius</hi> and temper of thoſe that have been old ſervants in the Houſe of God. The former (the younger) at his return diſcovereth the frame of his heart end Spirit, to his Father, thus: <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> Luke 15.21. As he had no temptation upon him to plead any thing he had done for his Father, to render him worthy in the leaſt degree of his favour, ſo was he far from looking this way with the leaſt of his thoughts: his hope of acceptance with his Father depended wholly upon his Fathers goodneſs, and readineſs to receive him upon his return; Whereas the Elder Brother, in a Conteſt with his Father, claims a kind of right and title to more of his love, than as he thought, he had yet at any time ſhewed unto him. <hi>And he anſwering, ſaid unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lo, theſe many years do I ſerve thee, neither tranſgreſſed I at any time thy Commandment, and yet thou never gaveſt me a Kid, that I might make merry with my friends. But,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ver.</hi> 29. <hi>David</hi> hath this Saying, Pſal. 62.10. <hi>If riches encreaſe, ſet not your heart upon them:</hi> As it is an hard matter for thoſe that are rich in this preſent World to keep off their hearts from truſting in their uncertain riches, or to keep them in truſt or dependence upon the living God (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.) whereas <hi>afflicted and poor people,</hi> and the widow that is deſolate, do, as it were of courſe, and by a kind of neceſſity, <hi>truſt in the name of the Lord</hi> (<hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.12. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.5.) In like manner, when men have wrought righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for many years together, and have heaped up Prayers upon Prayers, and hearings upon hearings, with great conſtancy, intermixing (it may be) now and then Faſting with ſome Alms-deeds, or other works of Charity, without making any ſcandalous digreſſion from the waies of God all their daies, it requires more ſpiritual ſtrength and wiſdom, than are found in ordinary Believers, for a man not to look upon ſo much beauty with an adulterous eye, and not, in ſecret at leaſt, to think that God, in conſideration of ſo much, ſuch long and faithful ſervice done unto him, may well forgive him his ſins and treſpaſſes, and ſo not to wear ſomewhat flat and ſuperficial in their eſteem of, and dependence upon the meer grace of God in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Whereas they whoſe courſe of life hath been nothing but ſin, and wickedneſs, and enmity againſt God, when they are converted and reconciled unto God, cannot (lightly) but be pure end chaſte in their dependence upon his grace and goodneſs, for all the good they expect from him, their conſcience plainly telling them that they have no ſelf-righteouſneſs, nor are in a capacity of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any whereon to build, or wherewith to feed the leaſt hope or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation in that kind. Now it is but reaſonable, that God, who hath deſigned the Salvation of men according to the terms of that Goſpel,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95016:66"/>which himſelf hath conceived, and communicated unto the World for that end, in the exact and preciſe model whereof himſelf alſo is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delighted, ſhould be more intent upon rewarding thoſe with ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who expect it from him with the greateſt and ſtricteſt conformity to his own mind, and to the terms on which he offereth it, than thoſe who are leſs obſervant of his counſel in this behalf, and, to a degree, lingering and hankering after another Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Neither is it contrary to any Principle or Rule of Equity, that God ſhould order the rewarding of thoſe in the firſt place, who have glorified him moſt in the World. Now 1. to believe the truth and faithfulneſs of God in his Promiſes, and his power, is to glorifie him, or to <hi>give glory</hi> unto him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20. 2. From hence it followeth<note n="*" place="margin">By the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this known princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in arguing (eaſie to be conceived in the Latine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, but hard to be Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) <hi>Ut ſe habet ſimpliciter ad ſimpliciter, ita magis ad magis.</hi>
                  </note>, that to believe the truth and faithfulneſs of God in his Promiſes, and his power to perform them, in ſuch caſes, wherein the performance is more rare, and more difficult to be believed, is a greater glorifying of God, and in a higher degree than to believe them in more ordinary caſes only; and wherein the belief is nothing ſo generous and noble, or ſo remote from the common Principles of reaſon. The high commendation and ſtrain of <hi>Abraham's</hi> Faith, by which (as we lately heard) he is ſaid to have given gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſo that he did become, or was made, <hi>viz.</hi> by God, as <hi>Ver</hi> 17.] <hi>the Father of many Nations.</hi> The meaning is, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> Faith, breaking through thoſe ſtrong oppoſitions, which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant experience of the World, and the common dictates of reaſon, or of nature made againſt it, was ſo highly pleaſing unto God for that abundance of glory, which in that reſpect it caſt upon him, that he judged it but a meet conſideration for it, to make <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>Father of many Nations;</hi> that is, to confer and ſettle this great dignity upon him, to be for ever after reputed, and acknowledged the great Exemplar or Pattern of all that to the end of the World ſhould believe, who for their numbers ſhould equalize many Nations. Therefore that believing in God, which ſympathizeth moſt with this Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> hath moſt of the ſpirit and power of it, and lifteth up it ſelf in the ſoul againſt the ſtronger aſſaults or encounters, muſt needs glorifie God more, than that which hath only the common impediments and obſtructions in the way of it, to oppoſe it. Now it is a plain caſe, that he that hath been an inveterate and obdurate ſinner, and hath the heavy burthen of the guilt of many thouſand moſt enormous and hideous provocations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his conſcience and ſoul, and of many years rebellion againſt God, when he believeth, hath, in his Faith, much communion with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in the excellency of his Faith, believeth againſt many fierce Lions and bears in his way, againſt the ſtrongeſt and moſt violent temptations
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95016:67"/>to diffidence and deſpair (the conſcience, I mean, of many horrid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrations, and of enmity againſt God, deſperately perſiſted in for a long time together, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) whereas he that cometh unto God early, and believeth in the morning of his years, not having debauched his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with any the bold and daring affronts, ſo frequently given unto God, and his holy Commands by this miſerable World, hath no ſuch mountains in the way of his Faith to be leaped over, hath no ſuch armed fears, no ſuch imperious contradiction of ſin to encounter: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, his Faith, though it holds good correſpondency with the Faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the nature and truth of it, yet is it far beneath it in that Crowning property of it, whereby it <hi>gave glory unto God</hi> ſo abundantly; I mean, the conception and birth of it in the ſoul, in the very face and preſence of many ſtrong oppoſers, who fought againſt it with an high hand, and ſought to ſtifle it in the breaking forth. This then is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon to vindicate the equity of that diſpoſition in God according unto which he (ordinarily) maketh the <hi>laſt firſt</hi> [and conſequently the firſt laſt in the ſenſe oft declared.]</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) there is a principle, or diſpoſition, found in the nature of man, frequently (and almoſt conſtantly, upon the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) acted by men, and this without the reaſonable or juſt offence of any man, which doth juſtifie that diſpoſition in God, with his acting ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably to it, of which we are now ſpeaking; and which God himſelf pleadeth in the Scriptures, as well by way of proof of the reality and truth, as of the righteouſneſs, or equity of this diſpoſition in him being parallel to it. When any part of a mans ſubſtance, which he valueth, or any perſon neerly related to him, to whom he dearly wiſheth proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and peace, have been a long time miſſing, ſo that he gives them (as we uſe to ſay) for little better than loſt, if by the favour of divine Providence, above his expectation and hope, he comes to re-enjoy both the one and the other, he is caſt into a kind of ecſtaſie of joy over them, and takes more contentment in them, than in thoſe in both kinds, for which he never was in the like ſorrow or heavineſs. This diſpoſition (I ſay) and behaviour in men God inſiſteth upon, partly to aſſure thoſe that ſhall doubt that there is ſuch a principle or diſpoſition in him (there being nothing in the nature of man, but by way of extract from the nature of God, who created him in his own Image, or like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;) partly alſo, to juſtifie the righteouſneſs, or reaſonableneſs of ſuch a diſpoſition in him, unto thoſe that ſhall queſtion this, in as much as the like is found in the generality of men without the reproof, or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of any man. The Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> in thoſe three Parables in the ſame Chapter, (<hi>Luke</hi> 15.) The firſt, of the loſt Sheep; The ſecond, of the loſt Piece of Silver; The third, of the Prodigal or loſt Child, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth that temper, or diſpoſition in men, with their practice, or beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, anſwerable to it, which ſembleth with that principle in God, out
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95016:67"/>of which he ſo frequently maketh the <hi>laſt firſt</hi> (in the ſenſe oft explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.) When he that had loſt one of his hundred ſheep, leaving the ninety and nine in the wilderneſs, to ſeek after the one which was loſt, having found it, he is ſaid to have <hi>laid it upon his ſhoulder, rejoycing: and coming home, to have called together his friends and his neighbours, ſaying unto them, Rejoyce with me, for I have found my ſheep which was loſt, ver.</hi> 4.5, 6. Read the other two Parables at your leiſure, eſpecially the latter, wherein, not only the great contentment and joy of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Prodigal, upon his return, is largely expreſſed; but his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction alſo, and choice reſpects towards his Son himſelf, being now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from his diſſolute and deſtructive courſes are emphatically repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; (<hi>ver.</hi> 20.22, 23, 24.) although he is ſaid to have had another, an elder Son, who had been regular, and well ordered all his daies. Yea, when this Son made himſelf agrieved that greater reſpects were ſhewed by his Father to his Brother, that had lately and for a long time together been a Son of <hi>Belial,</hi> than unto him, who had alwaies been obſervant of his Counſels and Commands, his Father pleads, not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the lawfulneſs, but the <gap reason="foreign">

So that the way of God in making the <hi>laſt firſt,</hi> and the <hi>firſt laſt</hi> (a way wherein he frequently walketh) that is, his giving the precedency of reward unto thoſe who having lived long in a loſt condition, and whoſe repentance was againſt hope, and above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, yet unfeignedly repent and turn with their whole heart unto him at the laſt, rather than unto ſuch, who, from the dawnings of their daies, have plodded on in a regular courſe, and profeſſion of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service, without any ſcandalous or reproachful deviation at any time; this way of God (I ſay) is juſtifiable by the like demeanours of the generality of men in like caſes. But,</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, or any thing formerly argued, or pleaded, <label type="milestone">

Nor is it impoſſible on the other hand, but that even they, who have waxed old in the ſervice of Sin and Satan, and ſo upon their repentance have had much forgiven them, and withal, more reaſonable advantages and engagements than their Brethren early called to excell in holineſs, and ſo to approve themſelves, towards, and in the cloſe of their daies, upon terms of higheſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God, and upon this account, to be of the <hi>firſt</hi> in reward, may notwithſtanding, before they die, through an unmanlike oſcitancy, and the allurements of the Fleſh, and of the World, turn their backs upon all the great advantages of their late Converſion, and either ſuffer themſelves to be overtaken with the uſual drouſineſs, dulneſs, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of old Profeſſors, and ſo become <hi>laſt</hi> in reward in the better ſenſe of the clauſe; or (which is much more ſad) caſt in their lot with final Apoſtates, and ſo become <hi>laſt,</hi> in the worſt and hardeſt ſenſe of all.</p>
               <p>As it was no part of the intent or meaning of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in preſenting the Lord of the Vineyard (in the Parable yet in hand) giving order to his Steward to pay the Labourers their wages in this order, <hi>beginning at the laſt unto the firſt</hi> (in the ſenſe ſo oft, and at large declared) either to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men from <hi>remembring their Creator in the daies of their youth,</hi> and believing with the firſt, but only to caution and admoniſh thoſe, who ſhall thus believe, that they take heed of thoſe evils which are ſo incident to a long race of Profeſſion, and that they be careful ſo to grow in grace daily all along their courſe, that every new day may ſeem to be the firſt day of their converſion unto God; or to encourage men to defer their Repentance unto old age, and until ſin hath abounded: but only to encourage thoſe for whom <hi>Satan</hi> hath been too hard, all, or the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the beſt of their daies, yet to repent at the laſt, by aſſuring them, that though it be very late in the day of their lives ere they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turn unto him, yet their repentance ſhall be moſt acceptable, and their entertainment by him with more, or greater reſpects of grace and favour than he is wont to vouchſafe unto their Brethren, who have been of far more ancient ſtanding in his ſervice. As theſe (I ſay) were the things intended, and not intended by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the paſſage in hand, ſo neither is there any other thing intended in all that explication that hath now paſſed on it. The gloſs doth all homage and reverence unto the Text, and trembleth to make it ſpeak any thing which is not in the heart and inward parts of it: Yea, and would not willingly conceal any of thoſe gracious and comely things, wherewith the heart of it is full
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95016:68"/>even to the brim. And (for a cloze) I ſhall here ſubjoyn this; that it is the ſenſe of ſome good Expoſitors (and this ſo probable, that I could with very little regret of Judgment eſpouſe it, and make it mine own) that the paſſage laſt inſiſted on, <hi>Give the Labourers their wages, beginning from the laſt unto the firſt,</hi> is the Maſter vein in the Parable, and that all the paſſages in it beſides are ſubſervient to it, and face towards it, as well thoſe in the rear of it, as thoſe in the front, and that they were fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> either only, or chiefly, to make way for a rational and commodious introduction of it.</p>
               <p>However by that narrow and large ſurvey, that hath been taken of the Parable, it ſufficiently (I preſume) appears, that which way ſoever it be managed, or the interpretation and ſenſe of it carried, ſo it be with reaſon, and with due reſpects to the ground or occaſion, and ſo to the ſcope of it, or concluſion intended by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be illuſtrated by it, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the proper import of the principle clauſes and paſſages in it, That there can nothing reaſonably be inferred from it, in favour of that opinion, which undertaketh to reduce all the Crowns of righteouſneſs, that ſhall be ſet upon the heads of the Saints, to one and the ſame weight in glory.</p>
               <p>We ſhall at preſent add a few Scriptures, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> and ſome Arguments (very briefly) to demonſtrate the truth of what is ſuppoſed in the Reaſon in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> that God diſtributeth rewards unto his Saints by different meaſures, and degrees. <hi>And they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and they that turn many unto righteouſneſs, as the ſtars for ever and ever, Dan.</hi> 12.3. Doubtleſs the Holy Ghoſt would not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize a ſpecial and eminent ſervice, ſuch as the <hi>turning of many to righteouſneſs</hi> is, as that they who have been diligent and faithful in it ſhould be ſignally rewarded by God in the Great Day; if all ſervices, or the moſt profitable kind of ſervices otherwiſe, ſhould be rewarded, and recompenſed by God upon equal terms with them. Conſider the plain tenour of the words; <hi>They that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and they that turn many unto righteouſneſs, as the ſtars for ever and ever.</hi> If ſo be that he had intended, or if this had been his ſenſe, That all Believers, or that all the Servants of God, all that fear God without exception, ſhould have been partakers of theſe rewards ſignified by the <hi>ſhining of the ſtars for ever and ever;</hi> there can no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be given, nor a colour of reaſon, why he ſhould ſingle out a certain vein of perſons from amongſt the great Community of the Saints; namely ſuch, <hi>as turn many to righteouſneſs,</hi> [that is, that have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, and done that which was in their power to do, to <hi>turn many unto righteouſneſs</hi>] as if none ſhould be rewarded at the Reſurrection with that peculiarity of reward but ſuch. Nay, doubtleſs his intent is to ſhew, that whereas there ſhall be very many rewarded, and that very graciouſly and bountifully at that day; yet there will be appropriate
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95016:69"/>rewards, Crowns (as it were) made on purpoſe, more weighty and maſſie in glory than the reſt for ſuch perſons as theſe. Then again, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that paſſage of our Saviour to the Mother of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. She came to him deſiring a certain thing of him, which was, that he would grant that her two Sons <hi>might ſit, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left hand in his Kingdom.</hi> Now I ſuppoſe that here, by <hi>ſitting on the right and on the left hand of Jeſus Chriſt in his Kingdom,</hi> are meant (and I think no man did ever lift up a thought to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) the chiefeſt and higheſt places of glory and ſpiritual preferment in his Kingdom. Poſſibly ſhe might look to an earthly Kingdom, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect her requeſt in reference thereunto; but when <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave his anſwer unto her, he doth not deny but that there was a <hi>right hand,</hi> and a <hi>left hand</hi> in his Kingdom; ſome more honourable, and richer manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and communications of the infinite bleſſedneſs of God than others. For thus ſaith he, <hi>Ye ſhall drink indeed of my Cup, and be baptized with the Baptiſm wherewith I am baptized; but to ſit on my right hand and left is not mine,</hi> &amp;c. He here ſuppoſeth, and giveth that to her for granted, that there was ſuch a thing, ſuch Prerogative honour in his Kingdom, as ſitting on his right hand, and left, but withal informeth her thus, that they were not his to give, ſave only to ſuch for whom they were prepared of his Father; implying, that God hath prepared theſe places for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the greateſt worth and eminency in his ſervice, on whom only they ſhall be conferred. And ſo 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. there is a place that ſprings yet another Notion relating to the Point in hand. <hi>He that planteth, and he that watereth is one: and every man</hi> (the Tranſlation is ſomewhat dull, and takes off the edge of the Scripture much; it ſhould not be, <hi>and</hi> every man, but, <hi>but</hi> every man) <hi>ſhall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</hi> The latter part of this verſe ſeems clearly to imply thus much, That every man hath a Labour of his Own, [that is, a meaſure, or degree of ſervice ſo appropriately his, that the ſervice of no other Saint ſhall be preciſely in worth or value commenſurable to it] and conſequently, that he ſhall have a Reward of his Own (in the ſame ſenſe) ſomewhat which doth, according to the ſtandard of divine bounty, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwer his labour. So that that which I conceive to be hinted here, is not ſimply this, that there are either different, or indifferent rewards, reſerved in the heavens by God to be conferred upon different Saints, but that there will be no two Saints in heaven whoſe rewards ſhall be equal. For though we cannot find a real difference between the ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, the faithfulneſs, and worthineſs of every Saint throughout the World, throughout the whole armies of them, yet God who weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with a more exact ballance than men do; if ſo be there be never ſo little more, if any Saint hath but the advantage of an hairs breadth in any ſpiritual worth above another, God (I ſay) is perfectly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of it, and will interpoſe by his righteouſneſs, that he ſhall have his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95016:69"/>own reward. Now if we ſhall ſuppoſe that every one ſhall receive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers reward, and ſo according to anothers labour (which he muſt needs ſuppoſe that holdeth all rewards equal) then ſhall no man (or no more than one) receive his own reward (in the ſenſe lately declared) or that which is exactly proportionable unto his own labour. But in that adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſative Particle, <hi>but,</hi> I ſuppoſe the Apoſtle ſecretly glances at the neglect, and contempt, which the <hi>Corinthians</hi> caſt upon him, preferring (as we know) and highly prizing, and ſetting up in their eſteem other teachers above him: thoſe that were not ſo ſound in Doctrine, or beneficial in teaching, or ſafe for them to hearken, or lean unto, being men that were eloquent, and ſpake fairly and ſmoothly, and carried themſelves with a kind of ſtately deportment; theſe kind of Teachers did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate apace and win ground of <hi>Paul</hi> in the hearts and minds of the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> Now, the Apoſtle after that he had in the former part of the Context propounded theſe queſtions: Who is <hi>Paul?</hi> And who is <hi>Apollos?</hi> And further ſaid, I have planted, and <hi>Apollos</hi> watered; he tells them, that <hi>he that planteth and he that watereth are one</hi> [mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in their end and ſcope of their labour both the one and the other, ſeeking after and endeavouring the peace, and comfort, and ſalvation of men; <hi>He that planteth,</hi> that is, he that converteth men; <hi>and he that watereth,</hi> that is, he that edifieth and helpeth men to perſevere unto the end, theſe are one, they meet together in the ſame end.] <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>every one ſhall receive of the Lord his own reward;</hi> as if he had ſaid, Ye may judge of me as you pleaſe; you may ſet me beneath the meaneſt of all your Teachers, and value my work in the Miniſtry accordingly: but the beſt is, I ſhall not be conſidered, or rewarded by God according to <hi>your</hi> eſtimate or opinion of me, but according to mine <hi>own labour,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, and faithfulneſs in his ſervice [that is, according to what my labour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall by the ſtandard of his grace and bounty amount un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.] If I have laboured more abundantly than they all, I ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded above them all. So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.8. (compared with <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7.) <hi>Knowing this</hi> (ſpeaking unto, and encouraging Servants to ſhew all faithfulneſs unto their Maſters, to adorn the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>) <hi>that whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame he ſhall receive,</hi> that is, ſhall be punctually and particularly conſidered by God for it. And ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7. <hi>For whatſoever a man ſows, the ſame ſhall he alſo reap.</hi> It cannot reaſonably be underſtood only of the ſameneſs of the Seed, as if his meaning was, that he ſhould reap the ſame kind of ſeed with that which he ſoweth; as when (for inſtance) he that ſoweth wheat reapeth wheat, ſo he that ſoweth the ſeed of Sanctification, or of good works, ſhall reap a harveſt of Sanctification or of good works; this cannot (I ſay) reaſonably be judged to be the meaning of the Apoſtle; but thus, <hi>whatever a man ſows,</hi> that is, whatever ſeed, either for quantity, or proportion, or of nature and quality any man ſoweth, as whether it be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95016:70"/>the ſeed of life and glory, or of ſhame and puniſhment, he ſhall reap in life and glory, and ſo, in ſhame and puniſhment accordingly. Whatſoever a man ſoweth: it doth not only import the <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kind; but the degree alſo or the proportion of the goodneſs or badneſs of the Seed that ſhall be ſown in any kind. And ſo in the other place, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.8. <hi>knowing that whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</hi> The Particle <hi>whatſoever</hi> muſt needs be comprehenſive, and diſtributive, of all a mans good actions, whether they have been hundreds or thouſands, or millions of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, together with all the degrees of their ſeveral goodneſſes (reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively) which are all exactly known unto, weighed, and eſtimated by God. Now theſe good actions of men, be they never ſo many for num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or ſo excellent in worth and goodneſs, yet the doers of them ſhall receive <hi>the ſame things of the Lord;</hi> that is, ſhall have in their reward a particular and appropriate conſideration, which ſhall anſwer not in ſtrictneſs of juſtice (for God doth not reward according to ſuch a Rule) but in the moſt gracious and bountiful eſteem of God, both every one of their ſaid actions, and every degree of goodneſs found in any of them, and in them all. Suppoſe a perſon, who from his youth up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til old age, and the hour of his death, ſhould continue diligent, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, fervent in ſpirit ſerving the Lord, ſhould receive no better, or greater, reward from him than he who, amongſt Believers, ſhall have brought forth leaſt fruit unto God, and been coldeſt in his ſervice; this perſon could not in this caſe be ſaid to receive <hi>whatſoever</hi> good thing he had done, but only ſome few of theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo many of them as ſhall anſwer, in number and worth, the ſervices of the other, who is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have done little unleſs we ſhall ſay that this other ſhall receive of the Lord, not only whatſoever good thing himſelf hath done, but whatſoever any other hath done in this kind.) But this word <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> is (as was ſaid) comprehenſive, and includes the whole body of a mans ſervice, and obedience, or laying out of a mans ſelf for God, and for righteouſneſs ſake, and implieth ſo many particular ſervices; ſo many particular rewards (upon the matter) For that very reward, whatever it be which ſuch a man ſhall receive, will have all his worthy actions and ſervices in it: there will be a Crown calculated and framed by God (as it were) on purpoſe for him, and fitted to his head, wherein every thing that he hath done for God, and upon the account of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> will be found in a ſutable weight of glory. I ſhall inſiſt only upon one place more (at preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.38. <hi>Therefore, my beloved Brethren, be ye ſteadfaſt, unmovable, alwaies abounding in the work of the Lord, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> You ſee he enforceth this point of advice or exhortation to them, <hi>alwaies to abound in the work of the Lord,</hi> upon this motive or ground; becauſe they <hi>knew</hi> [namely, in their continual abounding in the work of the Lord] that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95016:70"/>their labour <hi>ſhould not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> But if we ſhall ſuppoſe that they that <hi>abound</hi> moſt of all in the labour and work of the Lord, ſhall receive no more upon the account of ſuch their abundant labour than they that ſhould labour leaſt of all, being the moſt unprofitable of all Believers, and whoſe Faith ſhould be little better than an empty Vine; in this caſe their <hi>labour</hi> [namely, in the excellent degree, or abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of it] would <hi>be in vain:</hi> that is, it would turn to no account of profit, or recompenſe of reward, to him that ſhould undergo the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of it. For certainly the Apoſtle reminding them that their labour in the Lord, how abundant ſoever, ſhould not be in vain, doth not ſpeak of the fruit, or ſucceſs of ſuch their labour in the world, as that they might or ſhould do good unto, or convert many by ſuch their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, or the like, but of the bettering their own accounts at the Great Day; giving them to underſtand, that if they ſhould nor ſlack their hand in ſo great and bleſſed a buſineſs, they ſhould conſult honour and glory in abundance for themſelves in the day of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now if you pleaſe let us add to the Scriptures, opened and argued, a few reaſons to ſtrengthen your Faith yet further in the Point in hand.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such a diſpenſation of God, as his conferring of rewards with an equal inequality, giving greater things to thoſe that do more, and be more faithful: Such a diſpenſation (I ſay) as this, being proclaimed in the midſt of the World, hath more ſpirit and life in it to provoke and ſtrengthen every mans heart and hand unto Godlineſs, and this in the higheſt degree, than to declare, that they that ſow moſt ſparingly ſhall notwithſtanding reap as plentifully as they who ſow moſt liberally. For ſuch a declaration as this, in effect, they aſcribe unto God who make him a diſtributor of rewards without any diſtinction of the ſervices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by him. But (doubtleſs) ſuch a Notion or Doctrine as this, That all Believers ſhall fare alike, is of a dangerous and quaſhing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to the ſpirit of all ſignal excellency, and of a deſtructive antipathy to all heroick conceptions of Chriſtianity. When men have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to raiſe an eſtate, and get wealth for themſelves, How will they riſe early, and go to bed late, and eat the bread of carefulneſs? They will be more induſtrious by far than when they work only for ſtinted wages, which they know they ſhall have whether they work little or much: Alas working under ſuch a Notion weakeneth the hand, and enfeebleth the arm of any man. But on the contrary, when there are rewards held forth, and promiſed according to that which any man ſhall lift up his hand unto in working; Do more, and have more; Do more, and receive more; this raiſeth, incites, and quickens the ſpirit to its ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt activity. Were it ſo that all ſhould be equal, that they that wrought leaſt ſhould have as much from God as they that laboured moſt, ſuch a diſpoſition of things as this muſt needs be of this tendency, namely, to debaſe the Spirit, and unnoble the hearts of the Saints themſelves: to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95016:71"/>plant the <hi>Lebanon</hi> of the Church with ſhrubs inſtead of Cedars, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a generation of Dwarf-Chriſtians. We ſee many that paſs for Chriſtians, and poſſibly they may be ſuch indeed, that ſtudy, and caſt about, and enquire as narrowly as they can what is the loweſt degree of Faith and obedience, under which it is poſſible for men to be ſaved? becauſe they deſire to do as little of the will of God, and as much of their own, as will any waies ſtand with the ſaving of the great Stake of their Souls. Whether the minds of ſuch men as theſe be touched with the evil ſpirit of that Doctrine, which confounds <hi>infima cum ſummis,</hi> the loweſt and higheſt ſervices together, in their reward, I know not: but certain I am, that ſuch a Doctrine as this is of a moſt clear and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt tendency to work the hearts, and ſpirits, and conſciences of men to ſuch a paſs. For if there be no more for the greateſt Servants of God than for thoſe of the leaſt faithfulneſs of all (alas) men (as we know) being apt to be guided (or rather hurried on) in their way by princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſutable unto their fleſh, they will preſently caſt about, and reaſon with themſelves after ſome ſuch manner as this: Since it is ſo, that our portion in the World to come is fixed, and we cannot add to it, nor lay up any more treaſure for our ſelves there, than only that which will accrue to us meerly upon our believing; therefore we will make our ſelves as wiſe for this preſent World as we can; we will treaſure up riches, and live at eaſe, and take our comforts and contentments freely in the World, and go as near the brink of hell and deſtruction as we can without falling into it. And the truth is, that the conceit we ſpeak of (I mean, of an equality of reward) is a dangerous ſnare unto men, not ſimply to beat down (as it were) the price of their ſalvation as low as they can, and to keep out of the way of all excellency as far as they dare, but alſo never to advance ſo far in a courſe of godlineſs and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as whereby, or wherein to be ſaved. My Brethren, let me ſay this unto you, and conſider it well, That he that will be intent and wary of doing any thing more than what is ſimply neceſſary to Salvation, it is ten thouſand to one that he will never do ſo much. He is like to ſhoot ſhort of his mark that is afraid of over-ſhooting it: So he that is loath to do any thing upon a religious account, or for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Goſpel, without the doing of which he may be ſaved, is in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger of not doing that, without the doing of which he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such a diſpenſation as that for which we plead excellently commends and ſets off unto the World the great love that God bears unto righteouſneſs and well-doing. For if he ſhould recompenſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the leſs excellent and the more excellent waies of men alike, would it not argue that he did not bear any great affection unto holineſs or Chriſtian worth, at leaſt in their exaltation, and where they advance fleſh and bloud to the neareſt proximity unto the holy Angels? Or
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95016:71"/>would it not rather import ſome ſuch thing as this (which is very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him) namely, as if he did not care to have men ſingularly holy, or that any man amongſt his Saints ſhould be more excellent than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or out-ſhine him in good works? For if he doth ſo highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, and take delight in thoſe that ſtrive to out-run their fellows in the waies of his Commandments, why doth he not encourage men of this ſtrain and temper? Or why doth he not take a courſe to propagate ſuch a Generation in the World? Or is there any means ſo natural and proper to do it, as to diſtinguiſh and ſever perſons of this honourable Character, from thoſe of a more vulgar and ordinary allay, by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of greater and more honourable rewards to be conferred on them? As <hi>Caleb,</hi> by that generous promiſe of giving <hi>Achſa</hi> his daughter to Wife unto him that ſhould ſmite <hi>Kiriath S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pher,</hi> and take it, ſprang valour and courage in the breaſt of <hi>Othniel</hi> to undertake the enterprize, and perform it with ſucceſs, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 15.16, 17. In like manner, God by raiſing his Promiſes higher unto thoſe that ſhall quit themſelves at an high and worthy rate in his ſervice, than unto perſons that ſhall move in a more common Sphere of Chriſtianity, declareth that he ſeeketh a Generation of ſuch as will excel in holineſs, and that he delighteth to be ſerved with Prince-like ſtrains of zeal and faithfulneſs. Yea, if God did not regard righteouſneſs and true holineſs, where they are found in greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more than where he findeth them in leſs only, he could not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be thought to regard them at all. For thoſe degrees of the one, and of the other, which in perſons highly qualified with them, do ſuper-exceed that meaſure, or degree of them which are found in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of a lower pitch and ſtature, are true righteouſneſs, and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as well as they. Therefore unleſs it be granted that God regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them (I mean, thoſe ſuper-exceeding degrees of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs, of which we ſpeak) it cannot, in congruity of reaſon, be ſaid that he regardeth them (righteouſneſs and holineſs) at all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Such a diſpenſation, or diſpoſition as that for which we plead a Collation of Rewards, an inequality anſwering the inequality of the ſervices of men, commends that <hi>manifoldneſs of the wiſdom of God,</hi> of which the Scripture ſpeaketh, which a contrary diſpenſation would not do, nor afford any opportunity for the doing it. For if there be but one and the ſame degree of glory, one and the ſame reward for all the Saints; here is no matter for choiceneſs of wiſdom to ſhew it ſelf in finding out, and ſetting forth every mans reward in a true and exquiſite proportion to his works and labour, to his love and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But now if we ſhall ſuppoſe this to be the caſe (as doubtleſs it is) that God hath an innumerable company of Saints to be rewarded in glory; and to receive Crowns of bleſſedneſs from him, proportionable to the endleſs variety and difference of their waies and doings in the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95016:72"/>World: Now for him perfectly to underſtand, and compute the juſt and exact weight and worth of every mans ſervice, and to ſet out re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively unto the perſons to be rewarded; rewards exactly proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, muſt needs argue and declare a mighty depth, a marvelous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſiveneſs and exquiſiteneſs of wiſdom in him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> maketh it a Point as well of <hi>wiſdom,</hi> as of faithfulneſs, in a Steward being made Ruler over an Houſhold, to <hi>give them their portion</hi> [reſpectively] <hi>in due ſeaſon: Who is then that faithful and wiſe Steward? Who,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.42. The tranſcendent excellency of that wiſdom and underſtanding, which God gave unto <hi>Solomon,</hi> is thus expreſſed, <hi>And God gave</hi> Solomon <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding exceeding much, and largeneſs of heart, even as the ſand that is on the Sea-ſhore,</hi> 1 Kings 4.29. So where we read. <hi>his underſtanding is infinite</hi> (ſpoken of the underſtanding of God himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.5.) the Margent, out of the original hath it: <hi>Of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding there is no number.</hi> To accommodate a great multiplicity of various and different occaſions, ſo that none of them ſuffers through any defective or undue management, requireth an underſtanding ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very numerous, or rather without number. This is another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to prove, that God intendeth to walk by the Rule of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not of an uniform or abſolute equality in rewarding of his ſervants.</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) If God will puniſh differently more, or leſs, according as men have ſinned, more, or leſs, according to the different degrees of their demerits; then there is little queſtion to be made, but that he will proportionably reward men, more or leſs, according to the different degrees of their righteouſneſs and faithfulneſs. Now the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> That if God will puniſh ſinners, more, or leſs, according as they have ſinned in greater or leſſer meaſures; then is it reaſonable to conceive, that he will reward righteouſneſs according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the reaſon (I ſay) of this Conſequence is, becauſe otherwiſe he would ſeem to be more intent upon the puniſhment of evil doers than he is upon the rewarding of the righteous. We ſee that he is intent, and reſolved upon a courſe of Juſtice in the puniſhment of wicked men, both according to the nature and meaſure of their wickedneſs: which ſheweth, that he hateth ſin with a perfect hatred. So that if he ſhould not reward righteouſneſs where it is exalted to a greater degree, and ſhines with greater beauty anſwerable to the line and luſtre of it, it would argue, that his affection of love were but cold and dead to righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in her greateſt advancements; in compariſon of what his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of hatred and revenge are unto ſin in the high provocations of it. But it is a common ſaying among learned Divines (and queſtionleſs not more common than true) that God alwaies puniſheth all ſin <hi>citra con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignum,</hi> ſhort of the demerit and deſert of it: Yet it is more unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably and apparently true of the two, that he rewardeth all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95016:72"/>
                  <hi>ultra condignum,</hi> over and beyond the worth and deſert thereof. This, many expreſſions in the Scriptures, concerning the bounty of God in rewarding his Saints, do fully manifeſt. That paſſage of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Parable of the Talents, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 25.) which he putteth into the mouth of the Lord (perſonating himſelf) as ſpeaking to his <hi>good and faithful ſervants,</hi> one after another ſufficiently evinceth it: <hi>Well done, thou good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been faithful over a few things: I will make thee Ruler over many things,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 21, 23. So again he confirms the ſame, where he ſaith, <hi>And whoſoever ſhall give to drink unto one of theſe little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a Diſciple, verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall in no wiſe loſe his reward</hi> [meaning, according to the notion and import of the figurative expreſſion, he ſhall be abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewarded] <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.42. Thoſe expreſſions <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>verily I ſay unto you,</hi> and, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>he ſhall in no wiſe loſe,</hi> &amp;c. ſhew both that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is very intent upon, and (as it were) taken up with thoughts and purpoſes of rewarding even the meaneſt ſervices of his Saints; and likewiſe, that ſuch ſervices as theſe ſhall moſt aſſuredly be rewarded (the redoubling of the Negative Particle in the Greek Tongue fortifying the Negation.) And whereas the ſervices performed unto God by ſufferings for righteouſneſs ſake are deſervedly judged the greateſt and higheſt of all ſervices, yet even of theſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. compared here with <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. But the truth of this Point, That God in rewarding righteouſneſs ſurmounts all merit thereof, needs little proof, being (I ſuppoſe) acknowledged by all that are called <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> And as for that, which was the bottom and ground-work of the Argument in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> That God doth puniſh ſin and ſinners differently, the Scripture is yet more manifeſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47, 48. <hi>And that ſervant that knew his Lords will, and prepared not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, neither did according to his will, ſhall be beaten with many ſtripes. But he,</hi> &amp;c. Nothing can be more plain, than that men that ſhall ſin againſt knowledge, and contrary unto knowledge, ſhall be puniſhed more than they that ſin out of ignorance, eſpecially if it be not voluntary or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, So again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21, 22. <hi>It ſhall be eaſier for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo, <hi>eaſier for Sodom and Gomorrah,</hi> &amp;c. which clearly ſheweth, That God doth intend different puniſhments, proportionable to the ſeveral degrees of ſin and wickedneſs committed in the World; Rods, for leſſer and fewer, Scorpions, for greater and more ſins. Nor ſhall we need to ſay more for the clearing of this, the matter being ſo evident. And for the reaſon built in the Conſequential way upon this foundation it cannot reaſonably be denied (as was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argued) <hi>viz.</hi> That if God hateth ſin in all the degrees and aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it proportionably, and puniſheth it accordingly with greater and leſſer puniſhments, it can with no good congruity of his love unto
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95016:73"/>righteouſneſs, in all the meaſures and advancements of it, be ſuppoſed but that he intends to honour it with rewards anſwerable in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion unto them all; and ſo with greater, where he finds it in a greater clevation; as with leſſer, where it only reacheth an inferiour line.</p>
               <p>Only againſt this Doctrine two or three things may be objected, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> which we ſhall briefly propoſe, and anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Eternal life is ſaid to be the gift of God, <hi>Rom</hi> 6.23. If ſo, then muſt it not be ſuppoſed that he giveth it freely, and ſo may give it uniformly unto all his Saints, and without any unequal diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it unto them, according to their ſeveral attainments in righteouſneſs (reſpectively.)</p>
               <p>I anſwer; 1. That Eternal life may be called <hi>the gift of God,</hi> becauſe the collation of it proceedeth from the free purpoſe and good pleaſure of God to make a donation of it unto men upon any terms at all, upon any condition, or conditions whatſoever, or without condition. He might have kept it without any breach of Juſtice, had he ſo pleaſed, as an appropriate treaſure to himſelf, and his holy Angels for ever. 2. Becauſe he is now pleaſed to confer it upon them without any merit or deſert of theirs, which in ſtrictneſs of juſtice can be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. It doth not follow from either of theſe ſenſes, wherein Eternal life may be called <hi>the gift of God,</hi> that therefore he divideth it unto his Saints by a line of equality. For ſuppoſing that this life may be enjoyed in ſeveral proportions, or degrees of the glory and good things of it (as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was poſſeſſed and enjoyed by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and their reſpective Tribes, by unequal portions, and as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, that in his Fathers Houſe there were many Manſions, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2.) the collation of it in any of theſe, may properly be called <hi>the gift of God.</hi> Nay,</p>
               <p n="3">3. (And laſtly, for this) Though God, ſimply conſidered, and as not having made any diſpoſal of what is his own, as either by promiſe, agreement, or the like, may do with his own what he pleaſeth (as it is in the Parable lately opened at large, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.25.) yet having once made a diſpoſition of it in one way or other, and ratified it by his word, he is not at liberty to do with it any thing contrary hereunto: For he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, he is not at liberty to deny himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13. And <hi>David,</hi> ſpeaking of him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.2. ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt magnified thy Word above all thy name;</hi> meaning, that his Word or Promiſe ſhall have (as it were) and exerciſe a kind of Soveraignty over all his Prerogatives and Attributes, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that men need not fear that any of them ſhall at any time, or in any caſe whatſoever, move in the leaſt contrariety thereunto. So that as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ananias</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the money, which he pretended to have brought to the Apoſtles,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95016:73"/>
                  <hi>Whilſt it remained, was it not thine own? And after it was ſold, was it not in thine own power?</hi> Meaning, that he was not compelled to devote it unto the ſervice of the Church; but having done it, and declared it, he was not now at liberty to reſume it, either in whole, or in part: In like manner, God (I little queſtion) might (at leaſt without being liable to any juſt imputation from any Creature for ſo doing) have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated Eternal life equally unto his Saints, had he not declared himſelf by Promiſe that his purpoſe was to do otherwiſe (as hath been formerly ſhewed) but now <hi>having ſpoken it, he will alſo bring it to paſs: He hath purpoſed, he will alſo do it</hi> (as himſelf ſpeaketh in another caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.11.) The word that hath once paſſed his mouth returneth not, but holdeth on its courſe until it hath paſſed his hand likewiſe. Only it may be ſome queſtion, whether ſuch a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, as that we now contend againſt (a levelling of all Saints in their rewards) would not have been oppoſed by ſome of his Attributes, as Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in caſe he had kept himſelf free in reſpect of any promiſe or declaration to the contrary? We touched ſomewhat upon this lately.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Objection againſt our preſent Tenent may be made from thoſe paſſages in the Parable lately mentioned, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. in which all the Labourers, called, and coming in, ſome early, and ſome at the eleventh hour of the day, to work in the Vineyard, are notwithſtanding ſaid to have received at even, <hi>every man a Penny,</hi> ver. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That the ſting of this Objection was formerly pulled out, where we traverſed the Parable at large, and argued upon ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that though all the ſaid Labourers be ſaid to have received <hi>every man a Penny:</hi> yet every man's Penny which he received might be, or rather was of a different ſtamp and value from that received by another. And this reaſoning proceeded upon a ſuppoſal, that not only the Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers firſt, and laſt, called into the Vineyard, but that thoſe alſo called at the hours between, as at the third, ſixth, and ninth hour, received <hi>every man a Penny.</hi> But upon a more ſteady and narrow view of the Parable, I find nothing at all mentioned concerning the proportion or value of what thoſe intermediate Labourers received: It is not ſaid of them, that they received <hi>every man a Penny,</hi> but only of the firſt, and laſt. Concerning them, it only appears that the Steward had order from the Lord of the Vineyard to give them their hire, or wages, as their turn came amongſt the reſt of the Labourers: But moſt probable it is, that it was not <hi>a Penny,</hi> or the ſame in value with the hire of the firſt and laſt. For if ſo, why ſhould it not be as expreſly ſaid to have been <hi>a Penny</hi> as theirs is? Beſides (as was formerly argued) it cannot reaſonably be conceived that theſe received alike amongſt themſelves, or that thoſe of the third hours call received no more than thoſe of the ſixth, or thoſe of the ſixth no more than thoſe of the ninth; at leaſt
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95016:74"/>ſuppoſing that they were all, third, and ſixth, and ninth hour men alike diligent and faithful in their labour: For they were by the Lord of the Vineyard called in to labour upon theſe terms (reſpectively) <hi>whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is right</hi> [or juſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,] <hi>I will give you.</hi> Theſe words plainly point at rewards anſwerable in Equity, Reaſon, or Juſtice, in one kind or other, unto what their ſeveral labours ſhould be. He doth not ſay unto any of them, whatſoever I give to the reſt of the Labourers, whether they or you work more or leſs, I will give unto you. So that nothing can be more evident, than that there is nothing to be found in the ſaid Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that countenanceth in the leaſt that equality among the Saints in their rewards of bleſſedneſs and glory which ſome imagine.</p>
               <p>If it be yet urged, and demanded, but why, or how ſhould they that were called at the eleventh hour, and laboured but one hour only, be made equal in their wages, or reward, unto thoſe that were called early, and bare the heat and burthen of the day (for it is ſaid expreſly of both theſe that they <hi>received every man a Penny</hi>) if God intended not equal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards unto all his Saints?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; 1. We have an Engliſh Proverb, <hi>Early up and never the nearer:</hi> They that are longeſt at work do not alwaies the moſt, or beſt ſervice. Men may buſie themſelves, and take pains (as we uſe to ſay) about lifting a feather. And on the other hand, ſome in a ſhort time are as much or more beneficial with their endeavours, unto thoſe that imploy them, as ſome others that are doing all the day long. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, that he was born out of due time (as our Tranſlators render the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, though not ſo properly as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.8.) but certain it is that he was born an Apoſtle, and came into the work of God ſome conſiderable ſpace of time after all his fellows; yet we know he <hi>laboured more abundantly there than they all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. In like manner, they that were called at the eleventh hour might do as much good and acceptable ſervice as thoſe that were called early. And therefore no marvel if they received equal conſideration for their work with theſe.</p>
               <p>Beſides, God (repreſented by the Lord of the Vineyard) eſtimateth (as we know) the frame of the heart and inward diſpoſition of the mind into the outward works and ſervices of men. So that the body and bulk (as it were) of their ſervices may be fair and large, when as the ſpirit, of their value and acceptation with God, may not anſwer by much, and yet their perſons, nor ſervices, be wholly rejected neither: As on the other hand, where the hidden man of the heart is beautiful and lovely in his ſight, a performance or ſervice, which is but ſlender and ordinary in appearance, may be highly prized and accepted of by him; and this according to the moſt exact Rules of Juſtice, Reaſon, and Equity. <hi>Chriſt</hi> pronounced a juſt and true Sentence, when he ſaid, that the poor Widow, who caſt in only two Mites into the Treaſury, had
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95016:74"/>caſt in more than all the rich men, who yet are ſaid to have caſt in much, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.41, 43. Now it is not improbable, but that by the early-cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the Vineyard, may be ſet forth ſuch a kind of <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or Believer, who ſavours much of the juſticiary and legal ſpirit, and is commonly active and zealous enough in his way for God, but inclined to a rugged, harſh, and peremptory temper: which unpleaſant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and frame of heart, though it doth not make void their Faith, nor exclude them from the ſaving love of God, yet it much abates and brings down the value and eſteem of their outward ſervices and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances with him. So that Believers of a more Evangelical, ſweet, and Chriſtian conſtitution and frame of ſoul, may equalize them in acceptance with God, although they have not had time, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to equalize them in the one half of their external ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
               <p>If it be yet urged, and ſaid; But the Lord of the Vineyard doth not alledge againſt the early-called, either any defect in them, or in their work or labour, nor any thing more commendable in thoſe called at the eleventh hour, as any reaſon why he ſhould make theſe equal in reward unto them, but only his will and pleaſure; <hi>I will give unto this laſt, even as unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. From whence it ſeems that the will and good pleaſure of God is the only Rule, by which the Saints are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, and that by this Rule they ſhall be rewarded equally, whether their works have been more or fewer, more or leſs excellent, according to any computation.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, Theſe words from the Lord of the Vineyard to one of the firſt-called (in the name of them all) <hi>I will give unto this laſt, even as unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. do not at all prove, either that the Will of God is the ſole Rule by which the Saints ſhall be rewarded, or that no conſideration to the difference of their works, whether they have been more, or fewer, more or leſs excellent, ſhall be had therein. They only prove, that God (typified in the Lord of the Vineyard) will not acquaint proud, quarrelſome, or high minded perſons with the Counſels of his Will, or Reaſons of his Doings, eſpecially with ſuch as are more ſecret, but will put them off with telling them what his peremptory Will is, and an aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the juſtneſs and lawfulneſs of it; even as men likewiſe are wont to do by perſons of a like evil temper whereas they are willing and free to give account of matters unto thoſe that are ingenuous, and of good ſpirits. And this diſpoſition is found in God himſelf, according to theſe ſayings of <hi>David, The meek he will guide in judgment</hi> [that is, he will acquaint him with the grounds and reaſons of all that he requires of him to do] <hi>the meek he will teach his way</hi> [<hi>viz.</hi> by ſhewing him the goodneſs and deſirableneſs of it.] <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.9. So again, <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him,</hi> ver. 14. And <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.32. <hi>His ſecret is with the righteous.</hi> God is moſt wont to communicate things of a more ſpiritual and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:95016:75"/>myſterious cognizance but only unto thoſe that are of meek and yielding ſpirits, and reverently affected towards him. So that it is no marvel if the Lord of the Vineyard would give no other reaſon, but his will, unto perſons that were evil-ſpirited and contentious, of ſuch a diſpenſation as ſeemed hard unto them, although he was able and ready to give reaſon enough thereof otherwiſe. This for anſwer to the ſecond Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>The third (and laſt) Objection, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> which pleads againſt all prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence amongſt the Saints in glory, is taken from ſuch Scriptures, which intitle the Saints, indefinitely taken, or the whole ſpecies of them, not only unto the ſame glory, but unto ſuch glory, greater than which none can (lightly) be imagined. The places of this import are theſe (with others.) <hi>Then ſhall the righteous ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father,</hi> Mat. 13.43. So where it is ſaid of <hi>Chriſt, Who ſhall change our vile body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. So again (to mention no more) where the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> having ſaid, <hi>Henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that laſt day, and not to me only, but unto them alſo that love his appearance,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. All theſe Texts of Scripture ſpeak of the Saints in general, and without any differencing ſome from others by way of greater excellency: and yet they promiſe unto them all ſhining like the Sun in their Fathers Kingdom, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their vile bodies changed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and faſhioned like unto his own glorious body, the receiving Crowns of righteouſneſs from God, as well as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf: Which all ſeem to be expreſſions of as great glory as the greateſt of Saints are capable of. Therefore it is not to be conceived that one Saint ſhall differ from another in glory. But,</p>
               <p>To this alſo I anſwer; That theſe, and the like places, only prove an identity, or ſameneſs, in the ſpecies, or kind of that glory whereof all the Saints ſhall be partakers, not that they ſhall all partake of this glory in the ſame degree. They ſhall all ſhine with a Sun-like luſtre and brightneſs, and yet ſome out-ſhine others. The Sun it ſelf doth not alwaies ſhine forth with the ſame luſtre and glory. <hi>Debora</hi> (<hi>Judg.</hi> 5.31.) prayeth, that thoſe that love God may be <hi>as the Sun when he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth or goeth forth in his might:</hi> which ſuppoſeth that ſometimes he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with a weaker and leſs glorious ſplendour. Yea, it is ſaid, that <hi>the face</hi> of the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, in his transfiguration on the Mount, <hi>did ſhine as the Sun</hi> (Mat. 17.2.) Yet I think it is no mans Faith, that either the faces, or the bodies of the Saints ſhall ſhine with equal glory unto his. For how ſhould he then <hi>in all things have the preheminence,</hi> which yet the Apoſtle affirms concerning him? <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. Therefore when it is alſo ſaid, That he ſhall <hi>change the vile body</hi> of the Saints, <hi>that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body;</hi> the word <hi>like</hi> doth not
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:95016:75"/>import the quantity or degree, but only the quality, or nature of the glory of the body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unto which their vile body ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth.) For otherwiſe the import would be, that the bodies of all the Saints ſhould be equal in glory unto the body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf: which is a thing ſo little worthy belief, that (as was even now hinted) <hi>Chriſtians</hi> generally are either aſhamed, or affraid to affirm it. So that the meaning of the paſſage muſt needs be this, or to this effect: That <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the Almightineſs of his power, will ſo alter the property and condition of the bodies of the Saints, which now in the ſtate of mortality are vile [that is, of an abaſing and humbling complexion and frame] as to inveſt them with an heavenly ſplendour and brightneſs of the ſame kind with that wherewith his own body is made moſt tranſcendently glorious; not but that he ſhould be known amongſt them by the ſurpaſſing glory of his body above theirs, as readily as the Sun may be known from the reſt of the Stars, whoſe light nevertheleſs is of the ſame kind with the light of the Sun, and derived from it. Nor yet as if all the Saints, who ſhall all partake of this glory, ſhould partake hereof in the ſame meaſure or degree. As though all the Stars in the firmament of Heaven (which to us are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number) ſhine with one and the ſame kind of light (namely, that which is originally veſted in the Sun, and is by and from him communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto them) yet are they not equal among themſelves in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of this light, the Apoſtle himſelf atteſting the judgment of our ſenſe in this, that <hi>one ſtar differeth from another in glory,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41.) meaning, not in reſpect of the nature or kind, but in the quantity, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or degree of that light, which makes them all glorious. And if that notion of ſome Philoſophers, as well as of ſome learned <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> be true (which many thoughts beſtowed upon the Contemplation, have made little queſtionable unto me) that God hath ſtamp'd the matters of the viſible and inviſible World, with the ſame ſeal, and made the things that are ſeen in a rational correſpondency with the things that are not ſeen, that ſo by the one men might the more eaſily aſcend to the knowledge and belief of the other: I cannot but judge it a probability of the firſt magnitude, that God, as the Author of Nature, hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch Creatures, as the Sun on the one hand, and the reſt of the Stars (reſpectively) on the other, and ſo contrived dependencies, reſpects, and relations between, and amongſt them, not only (if ſo much) to ſerve the World in thoſe inferiour accommodations of light, influence, diſtinction of ſeaſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (for, in reaſon, he might have as well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for theſe, and all ſuch ends and purpoſes, by ſome other contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and ordering of them, at leaſt in ſome particulars) but that they might be a natural type or repreſentation, wherein he purpoſeth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, in glorifying his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> on the one hand, and his Saints (reſpectively) on the other. For he purpoſeth to confer and ſettle upon

                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuch an heaped meaſure of glory, by which he ſhall be known to be <hi>the only begotten of the Father</hi> (Joh. 1.14.) and be eminently conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous amongſt, and over all his Saints, and from which all theſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their different capacities, ſhall be furniſhed, and filled with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; even as all the ſtars, according to their ſeveral magnitudes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptivities, have their fill of light communicated unto them, by, and from the Sun, whoſe ſuperabounding light, by degrees without number, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth theirs.</p>
               <p>So when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> promiſeth, or declareth, that Crowns of righteouſneſs ſhall be given to all the Saints by Chriſt (for theſe he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, by thoſe that love his appearance) as well as unto himſelf (although there will be found very few or none of them equal in ſervice unto him) his meaning only is, that they ſhall be advanced to royal honour and dignity, and wear Crowns as well as he: But amongſt Kings themſelves there is (we know) a great difference in reſpect of riches, extent of Dominion, number of Subjects, ſtrength for war, and conſequently, in Magnificence, Grandeur, Majeſty; Yea, all Crowns are not of equal weight or value. Nor doth the Apoſtle (in the place in hand) give the leaſt intimation of an equality in worth or richneſs in all the Crowns that ſhall be given by <hi>Chriſt</hi> unto his Saints in glory. The current of the Scripture (as was lately ſhewed unto you) runs another way. And thus we have at laſt (we truſt) made good the firſt of the two ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals in the reaſon laſt propounded: Which was, that there is a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of rewards, greater, and leſſer, intended by God to be counferred upon his Saints, according as his grace ſhall be found to have wrought in them more or leſs effectually in this preſent World.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing ſuppoſed in the Reaſon was, that every man, every perſon of mankind ſtands bound in duty towards God (yea, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards himſelf alſo) to put himſelf (by the grace vouchſafed unto him) into a capacity of the greateſt rewards, to ſeek and labour for the richeſt inveſtiture of glory that ſuch a Creature as he is capable of. There is a ſenſe (indeed) wherein the ſeeking of ſuch a thing is ſo far from being matter of duty, that it is nothing elſe but ſin and vanity to do it. And this is ſuch a ſeeking as that which we read of in the Mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.20, 21. and ſo in the Children themſelves, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.35. Now the Mother ſought for the higheſt preferments in Heaven, ſignified by ſitting on the right and left hand of Chriſt in his Kingdom, ſhe ſought (I ſay) for this in the behalf of her Sons, in the nature of a gratuity, hoping, that ſeeking in time, and before the ſaid places were diſpoſed of, ſhe might be gratified in her requeſt, as if the firſt deſires were likeſt to ſpeed. And ſo the Sons themſelves ſought it after the like manner, or upon the ſame terms; if the honours, or high places in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdom, were to be obtained by meer petitioning, or asking for them. The meaning therefore of the ſuppoſition is, That it is every mans duty
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95016:76"/>not ſimply to ask, or only to deſire, the moſt excellent things of the World to come: but to put themſelves into a regular capacity to attain them; that is, to endeavour to make themſelves ſuch by a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> worthineſs of life and converſation, and deporting of themſelves in every kind, both towards God and Man, as beſt becometh them. Theſe high and choice preferments in Heaven muſt be for whom they are prepared. <hi>It is not</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> being ſolicited by the Mother for the Sons) <hi>it is not mine to give,</hi> but (ſaith our Tranſlation) <hi>it ſhall be given unto them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</hi> Now theſe words <hi>[it ſhall be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them]</hi> are not in the original, neither were they ſpoken by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The words of the Text are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. that is, <hi>It is not mine to give, but</hi> unto thoſe [or except it be unto thoſe; or but only unto thoſe: the reſtrictive Particle, <hi>only,</hi> being frequently to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, as I have ſhewed by ſeveral inſtances upon another occaſion] <hi>for whom it hath been prepared.</hi> Therefore his meaning (doubtleſs) is this, not to deny that they were his to give, but that they were not his to give to any other, but only unto thoſe, that is, to that kind of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or to ſuch for whom they were prepared, deſigned, or appointed by the Father. By the way, this Particle or Pronoun, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, tranſlated for whom, doth not point at any particular perſon or perſons by name, as if (for example) there were any two perſons amongſt the univerſality of mankind, for whom in a perſonal conſideration, or becauſe they were ſuch and ſuch individual perſons, places were prepared, or intended by God for them; but the ſaid Particle is to be taken <hi>adjectively,</hi> as it is in ſeveral other places, and not meerly nominally or pronominally; that is, not as ſignifying naked, or meer ſubjects, but ſubjects ſo and ſo qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified or diſpoſed. So you have it in other places of Scripture beſides this, as in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For I know whom I have believed;</hi> that is, what manner of one, what manner of God, how great, how faithful, and how full of power he is in whom I have believed. So that the Pronoune <hi>whom</hi> here doth not meerly ſignifie the Perſon or Eſſence of God, but God with his Attributes, as endued with thoſe excellencies and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which make him a God meet to be truſted in, and relied upon. And ſo our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. ſpeaking unto the reſt of his Diſciples of <hi>Judas</hi> and his treachery, <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whom I have choſen,</hi> meaning, not how many, or what perſons by name, but what manner, or what kind of perſons they are, how affected, how inclined, or diſpoſed, whom I have made choice of to be my Diſciples; I know the frame of their heatts, and of their ſpirits; I know the reſt of you are true and faithful, and will not betray me; I know likewiſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning one of you, that he is unfaithful, and will prove a Traytor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. And ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15. God ſaith to <hi>Moſes, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion,</hi> that is, on what kind of perſons I pleaſe, or on perſons qualified to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95016:77"/>mine own mind and liking; and not on ſuch whom men ſhall obtrude upon me, as perſons more meet and worthy in their eye, on whom I ſhould <hi>have mercy</hi> [that is, whom I ſhould juſtifie and ſave.] The meaning is not (although it be frequently ſo carried and underſtood) that God will ſhew mercy <hi>on whom,</hi> that is, on what perſons, or indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, of mankind, perſonally and by name conſidered, as he pleaſeth; but by thoſe on whom he ſo peremptorily, and reſolvedly aſſerteth and declareth that <hi>he will have mercy,</hi> and that he will not be altered in his purpoſe concerning them; he meaneth, the whole <hi>Species</hi> of Believers, whoever, or how many ſoever they ſhall be; theſe being perſons quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to his mind on that behalf (I mean, judged meet by him to have the <hi>mercy</hi> here ſpoken of ſhewed on them) and the only perſons thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified. For by the <hi>mercy</hi> here ſpecified, is not meant the <hi>mercy</hi> of Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, repentance, regeneration, believing, or the like, but the <hi>mercy</hi> of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or acceptance with God. For this (juſtification) was the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Apoſtles diſcourſe, where he inſiſteth on the words before us, not any of the other. And God may well expreſs his juſtifying of men, or his pardoning their ſins, by ſhewing <hi>mercy</hi> unto them, becauſe whilſt they lie under the guilt of ſin, they are in a ſtate of greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. But the ſenſe of this Text of Scripture we have diligently inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after in our expoſition on <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>Pag.</hi> 150, 151, &amp;c. to the end of <hi>pag.</hi> 160. where (I truſt) you may amply ſatisfie your ſelves about it. The ſaid Particle <hi>who,</hi> or <hi>whom,</hi> you may find uſed again (and this twice together) in the ſame Concrete or adjective ſenſe (as I call it) a little after, <hi>viz. ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth;</hi> that is, he hardeneth what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons, or what kind of ſinners or wicked men he pleaſeth. Again, in theſe words of the <hi>Jews</hi> unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 8.25. <hi>Whom makeſt thou thy ſelf to be?</hi> Their meaning was, What manner of perſon, how great, how holy, how far above all other men wouldeſt thou make us to believe thee to be? To forbear more inſtances at preſent; when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> demands, <hi>Lord, who ſhall abide in thy Tabernacle,</hi> &amp;c? (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.1.) his meaning is, what kind of perſons, how qualified, or what lives and converſations muſt they be? (as appears by the ſequel of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and the deſcription of the men here.) But this only by the way; and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally for the clearing the place cited, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.20. That which we have at preſent to ſhew, is, That it is not at every mans, nor (indeed) at any mans liberty or pleaſure whether he will live, or act ſo, or at ſuch a rate of righteouſneſs and holineſs, whilſt he liveth in the World, as ſimply to be ſaved, and no more; but the whole World of mankind, joyntly and ſeverally ſtand charged, by him that is the great King thereof, as with matter of duty, to deſign the greateſt and moſt deſirable glory in the Kingdom of Heaven; the firſt-born of that glory which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to the Children of men; they ſtand bound to project manſions
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:95016:77"/>for themſelves, as near to the manſion of the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> as may be, where they may have the richeſt Communication of the Great God unto them, which he judgeth meet to make of himſelf unto men: they ought to ſtrive (reſpectively) for the wearing of the richeſt and weightieſt Crown of glory, that is prepared and laid up in heaven for thoſe whoſe hearts will ſerve them with an holy and heavenly ambition to aſpire unto it.</p>
               <p>Now, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> that it is a duty lying upon all men to ſtrive after that which the Scripture calleth <hi>perfection;</hi> and conſequently, to exerciſe themſelves in ſuch things which are proper to inveſt them with ſuch a capacity as we ſpeak of, to qualifie them for the high places in the World to come, is of eaſie demonſtration and proof both from the Scripture, and otherwiſe. <hi>Be you therefore perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect,</hi> Mat. 5.48. It might be tranſlated more emphatically, <hi>you ſhall therefore be perfect;</hi> for ſo the Future Tenſe in the Indicative Mood is many times uſed inſtead of the Imperative, only with the greater ſeriouſneſs and weight. As he that enjoyneth, or commandeth, when he would ſignifie and expreſs his authority to the height, he doth not ſimply ſay unto him, that he would have him to do a thing; do this, or that; but he ſaith unto him, you ſhall do it, or you muſt do it. So here, <hi>You ſhall be perfect as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven is perfect;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I impoſe it upon you as a matter of ſoveraign concernment, both unto me and to your ſelves, that you give out your ſelves to the utmoſt in ſtriving to imitate the <hi>perfection</hi> of your heavenly Father, and to be as abſolute in all things appertaining unto you to do, as he is in all things that are honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and proper for ſo great a Majeſtie to do; you muſt not indulge the Fleſh, nor be careleſs or looſe hearted in obſerving this my charge which I lay upon you; but endeavour with all your might to expreſs all the goodneſs, and ſweetneſs, and excellency in every kind, which you ſee in your Heavenly Father: Your conſciencious ſubmiſſion unto this my Command will both honour me highly, as you are my Diſciples, and I your Lord and Maſter; and will make your faces alſo to ſhine in glory above theirs who ſhall be more remiſs or negligent in obeying it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you regard me, or your ſelves, you muſt remember it. And ſo of <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21. to the young man that came to him to know what he ſhould do to inherit eternal life, <hi>If</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>thou wilt be perfect, go and ſell all that thou haſt, and give unto the poor, and thou ſhalt have treaſure in Heaven.</hi> Surely, our Saviours meaning was not to leave the young man at liberty, whether he would be <hi>perfect,</hi> yea or no, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would be a complete <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and Diſciple of his own, but rather to impoſe this by way of Command upon him. Certainly <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not tolerate or allow any man in any imperfection. He is (indeed) very graciouſly and mercifully indulgent unto men in pardoning many weakneſſes and imperfections: but yet he never ſo hideth them, as not
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:95016:78"/>to let them underſtand that they fall ſhort of what they ought to do, or to reprove them for it. Again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 11. <hi>This alſo we wiſh, even your perfection.</hi> So that <hi>perfection,</hi> that is compleatneſs in all the Will of God (as the Apoſtle ſomewhere expreſſeth it) is nothing but what is matter of duty impoſed upon all Saints. <hi>There is no fear in love: but perfect love</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18.) <hi>caſteth out fear.</hi> By the way, <hi>perfection in love,</hi> argueth <hi>perfection</hi> in every thing beſides, for love is ſaid to be <hi>the keeping or fulfilling of the whole Law.</hi> But why ſhould he ſay, <hi>there is no fear in love?</hi> The meaning (queſtionleſs) is not, That there is no fear mingled with the affection of Love; or that fear was not any part or ingredient in it. (Theſe are too flat Notions for the Holy Ghoſt) No: but <hi>there is no fear in Love,</hi> that is, with <hi>Love</hi>

But (ſaith he) <hi>perfect Love,</hi> that is, Love when it is ſincere, and cometh to any perfection, to any conſiderable maturity and ſtrength, that it beginneth to fill the ſoul of a man, and commandeth all things to be done, which the nature of Love requireth, now it <hi>caſts out,</hi> and diſchargeth the heart and ſoul of ſuch a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and fad Companion as Fear is; he ſpeaketh of Fear that hath tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or pain [or rather puniſhment, as the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſignifieth, meaning for ſin] in it. It is a certain ſign that he that feareth, that is, that feareth wrath, and vengeance, and deſtruction from God, is not <hi>perfect in Love</hi> towards God, but his Love is maimed, and weak, and acteth at a low rate. Now, when a man's Love is thus broken, it is not of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authority and power to do the execution we ſpeak of, but Fears and Jealouſies of God's diſpleaſure will keep poſſeſſion in the ſame heart with it, and will be ever and anon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nſulting over it. But (ſaith he) being made <hi>perfect,</hi> and grown to any ſtrength, that it filleth the ſoul; now it throweth off all ſuch fears. The reaſon (in a word) why, or the manner how, Love caſteth out the fear ſpecified, when perfect, may be thus conceived. A man when he loveth God perfectly, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireneſs and throughneſs of affection, he cannot (lightly) but know that he doth love him: A man can hardly carry fire in his beſome and not know it. But when his Love acteth brokenly, and is at many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults in the courſe of it, as if it had a miſcarrying womb, now a man is apt to ſuſpect whether indeed he doth really and truly love him or not; becauſe they that love him not may now and then, by fits, and by ſtarts (as we uſe to ſay) and in a good mood, quit themſelves, both in words and in deeds, like unto thoſe who do truly and unfeignedly love him. Yea, thoſe many things, which <hi>Herod</hi> did at the preaching of <hi>John,</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:95016:78"/>were ſuch a kind of fruit which the true love of God oft-times beareth. Now, when a man cometh to reflect upon himſelf, as one that truly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably loveth God, it is not likely that he ſhould be jealous whether God loveth him or no; (only ſuppoſing that he certainly knoweth and believeth that God knoweth as well, nay, much better, than himſelf that he loveth him.) Men loving themſelves, and their own welfare and peace, cannot ſo far deſtroy nature out of them, as to ſeek the prejudice or ruine of thoſe whom they certainly know to be their faſt and faithful Friends. Nor can the Judgments or Conſciences of perſons, that know leaſt of God, be ſo far ignorant, or miſprizant of him, as to think that he intends the miſery, or deſtruction of any of thoſe whom he moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly knows to be with their whole hearts and ſouls devoted in love unto him, and to his glory. But this by the way, to give a little light to a Scripture of moſt rich and precious importance, to thoſe that either deſire to love God in the higheſt, or elſe love themſelves to ſuch an height, as to be willing to purchaſe their freedom from all penal fears in a way of the greateſt honour that can be imagined; I mean, by giving their hearts whole and entire in Love unto God. That which we look at in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage as ſerving our purpoſe, is, that the Saints are therein encouraged and provoked to perfection in Love; which (being interpreted, as was lately hinted) is to all perfection. Now certainly, it is the duty of every Creature to drink in all encouragements from God, as Fiſhes drink water, naturally, conſtantly, and with delight, and to lift up their hearts and hands unto whatſoever by them they are invited and quickened. And he that encourageth, or inviteth unto perfection, doth by the ſame act, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite alſo, and encourage unto the ſeeking after the greateſt and beſt things that Heaven will afford.</p>
               <p>We might purſue the Point in hand yet further, by inſiſting on ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other veins of Scriptures in which the truth thereof beats quick and high: and more eſpecially on that large paſſage, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. from <hi>ver.</hi> 11. to the end of <hi>v.</hi> 15. together with <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. In the former of which places the Apoſtle affirmeth, that the great end projected by the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his magnificent bounty unto the World at his Aſcenſion into heaven when <hi>he gave gifts unto men, ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, was the perfecting of his Saints, the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the body of Chriſt</hi> in all and every the members of it <hi>unto a perfect man.</hi> In the latter the ſame Apoſtle profeſſeth his comportment with the ſaid great end of his great Lord and Maſter, in theſe words (ſpeaking of him) <hi>Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wiſdom, that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> But enough (I ſuppoſe) hath been already alledged, and argued from the Scriptures to ſettle this in the judgments and conſciences of men for truth, that there is no perſon of mankind, at leaſt not amongſt the Saints, but ſtandeth bound in duty to lay himſelf out with all his might, for the obtaining of the higheſt Prize in glory.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:95016:79"/>
               <p>If you ſhall now ask me a reaſon of this aſſertion (becauſe it may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange unto you that it ſhould be matter of duty unto men and women to deſire and ſeek after the greateſt excellency in glory; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> however it may be their duty to excel in all righteouſneſs, and to ſtrive after <hi>perfection</hi> in this life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe two ſeem to be of a much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring conſideration) I ſhall endeavour to ſatisfie you with preſenting you with two or three Conſiderations, which (if you pleaſe) you may call ſo many Reaſons of the Point.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is the duty of every perſon amongſt the Children of men (and much more amongſt thoſe that believe) to conſult and endeavour the cleareſt and fulleſt manifeſtations of how high an eſteem and value the ſervices of his poor Creature, man, are with God when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed upon the beſt terms, that he enables them to perform them. This is a Conſideration, unto the truth whereof every man's judgment and conſcience (I may well preſume) will readily ſubſcribe: For there is nothing in God, but what being diſcovered and made known maketh for his glory. And the fuller and more convincing any diſcovery of his things, is, his glory proportionably is ſo much the more advanced. Now it cannot appear, at leaſt not ſo manifeſtly, or with that demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative evidence, by any lower inveſtitures of men with glory, at how wonderful a rate he prizeth righteouſneſs and faithfulneſs found in their exaltation in men. But they who ſhall ſtrengthen the hand of God by their high actings in waies and works of righteouſneſs and true holineſs, to bring forth the beſt Robe of glory to put upon them, theſe are the men that will do their God that moſt worthy and acceptable ſervice, to give him an opportunity of declaring upon the moſt unqueſtionable terms of ſatisfaction unto the World, of how ſacred a repute and eſteem with him ſo poor and vile a Creature, as man is, may come to be, if he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and behaveth himſelf, only for the few daies of his earthly Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage accordingly. God delighteth in thoſe Creatures moſt, that will draw him forth, in his goodneſs and bounty, moſt freely and fully; as appears by his extraordinary rejoycing over <hi>Phinehas,</hi> for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch an act, which gave him a regular opportunity to ſhew the riches of his grace and mercy in ſparing the lives of his people, which otherwiſe his juſt ſeverity againſt their ſins would not, as it ſeems, have permitted him to do. See and diligently conſider, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.11, 12, 13. And certainly, it is the duty of every Creature, and much more of the Saints, to ſeek to give the choiceſt pleaſures they are able to the ſoul of their Great Creator: and conſequently, to ſet their hearts upon drawing out of his hand the largeſt portion of that glory, and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherewith he hath judged meet to reward the ſervices of men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is ſaid (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10.) that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the end of the World, <hi>ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95016:79"/>them that believe.</hi> This is to be underſtood in reſpect of that glorious and bleſſed eſtate and condition, whereunto it will then appear, that ſuch a vaſt multitude of poor and deſpicable Creatures, as his Saints ſometimes were, are now, by his Grace, and work of Mediation, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. In this reſpect, <hi>the body of Chriſt,</hi> conſiſting of the whole num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Saints and Believers, is ſaid to be <hi>his Fulneſs,</hi> Eph. 1.23. <hi>which is his body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all:</hi> Namely, becauſe he will never be ſeen in the fulneſs of his glory, or rather becauſe he cannot be duly eſtimated in his heavenly worth and greatneſs, but by the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous happineſs, unto which ſo many Millions of Creatures, lately poor, vile, and ſinful, have been orderly, aad honourably advanced by him. Now certain it is, that if <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall be glorified (over and beſides his own perſonal glory) in, and by the glory of his Saints, and be <hi>admired</hi> in the bleſſedneſs, wherewith all that believe ſhall be inveſted by him; the greater the glory and felicity of any of them ſhall be, he muſt needs be the more <hi>glorified</hi> and <hi>admired</hi> in them. And if it be the duty of all the Saints, not only, or ſimply, to deſire and ſeek after thoſe things, whereby <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be made glorious and wonderful, but rather after thoſe, whereby he may be lift up in glory and admirableneſs to the higheſt; evident it is from the Premiſes, that it muſt be their Duty alſo to preſs with all their might after the greateſt Excellency in that glory which is intended and held forth by God unto men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Unleſs men ſhall ſtir up their hearts, and ſtrengthen their hands, by a deſire and expectation of the greateſt rewards aſſigned by God unto righteouſneſs, and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> worth in any kind, their hearts will never ſerve them to fly that high pitch of righteouſneſs and true holineſs which (without controverſie) they ſtand engaged in duty to do; nor yet to ſuffer thoſe things from the World, which their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Profeſſion may very poſſibly require at their hands. This I might clearly ſhew you by the light of Nature, and grounds of Reaſon: but I ſhall content my ſelf to demonſtrate it by the clearer light of the Scriptures only.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is evident from many paſſages here, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> that men are not wont to undertake any thing of difficulty, trouble, or charge (at leaſt if they ſo apprehend it) but upon hope of reaping ſome advantage or benefit in one kind or other by it. <hi>Who planteth a Vineyard</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>and eateth not of the fruit thereof?</hi> [Meaning, that no man would be at the coſt and trouble of planting a Vineyard, did he not deſire and hope to eat of the fruit thereof; that is, to accommodate himſelf in one kind or other by it.] So again, <hi>Who feedeth a Flock, and eateth not of the Milk of the Flock?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9 7. Soon after, <hi>For our ſakes no doubt this is written; that he that ploweth ſhould plow in hope; and that he that threſheth in hope</hi> (he ſuppoſeth that no man threſheth upon any other terms) <hi>ſhould be partaker of his hope.</hi> Afterwards, towards the end of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:95016:80"/>the ſame Chapter, <hi>And every man that ſtriveth for the maſtery is tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in all things. Now they do it for a corruptible Crown,</hi> &amp;c. meaning, out of a deſire and hope to obtain ſuch a Crown. It is repugnant to the very nature and frame of a rational being, to be drawn forth into action, in one kind or other, but by a deſire and hope of compaſſing ſome end. But of this there is little queſtion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Mens ingagements and actings are never like to riſe higher than the level of that good which is deſired and hoped to be obtained by them; I mean, if they underſtand the juſt value and worth of it. Men will not (as our common Proverb is) buy Gold too dear: If they put themſelves to any hardſhip, to knowingly expoſe themſelves to any danger, they muſt be inſpired hereunto both by a deſire and hope of ſome purchaſe proportionably conſiderable in their eye. They that ſtrove for Maſteries would not have been ſo diſtrictly and auſterely ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemious, as the Apoſtle intimates (as we lately heard) they were, had it not been for <hi>a Crown,</hi> which, however corruptible (as he there ſpeaketh) was notwithſtanding in their apprehenſions highly valuable. <hi>David,</hi> indeed, endeavouring to render himſelf as a perſon inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto <hi>Saul,</hi> expreſſed himſelf to him thus: <hi>For the King of Iſrael is come out to ſeek a Flea, as when one hunteth a Partridge in the mountains,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.20. But if <hi>Saul</hi> had not looked upon the ſuppreſſing of <hi>David</hi> as a matter of a thouſand times greater conſequence unto him than the catching of many Fleas, or the taking of many Partridges, he would not have put himſelf to the trouble and charge of coming out with an Army of men to purſue him. And if the life of <hi>Sampſon</hi> had not been judged a great Prize by the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> of <hi>Azzah,</hi> they would not have loſt their ſleep, and watched all night to have made themſelves Maſters of it: Yea, God himſelf knowing that men would never take the Yoke of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> upon them, nor ſubmit unto the holy Diſcipline of the Goſpel in the exerciſes of Repentance, Mortification, Self-denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor expoſe themſelves to the bloudy hatred and malice of the World for righteouſneſs ſake, unleſs their ſpirits were raiſed and heightned to ſuch great engagements as theſe by hopes of very ſignal and glorious recompenſes and rewards; he applieth himſelf unto, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with them accordingly, giving them aſſured hopes of life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, and bleſſedneſs for evermore, upon their obedience. He (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) conſidered, that leſſer or lighter encouragements, or retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than theſe, though in Conjunction with the moſt prevailing Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Motives otherwiſe, as Ingenuity, Goodneſs of Nature, Love of Righteouſneſs, Love of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet would not do that holy and happy execution upon the hearts and ſpirits of men, which muſt be done to make them Proſelytes unto true godlineſs, and perſons after his own heart to fulfil all his pleaſure. This the Holy Ghoſt himſelf plainly teacheth in ſeveral places: By which (ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> that is, by which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95016:80"/>glory and power of God; or according to ſome Copies, which read not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by whom, <hi>viz. Chriſt</hi>) <hi>are given unto us moſt great</hi> (for ſo the Original) <hi>and precious promiſes; that by theſe you might be partakers of the Divine Nature, having eſcaped the corruption that is in the World through luſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. Clearly implying, that God had no other way [agreeable to his Wiſdom, and meet to be taken with ſuch a Creature as man] to reduce men from their ſenſual, vain, and wicked diſpoſitions and practices, wherein they were deeply habituated, and engaged with the reſt of the World, unto a conformity to himſelf in holineſs, but only by promiſes, and theſe no whit leſs, for the matter and good things contained in them, nor leſs precious [in reſpect of the abundant aſſurance given for the performance of them] than thoſe that he hath now given unto them in the Goſpel. The expreſs tenour of the words, if they be diligently minded, give out this Notion: Men would never have been wooed from Sin and Vanity, to eſpouſe Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs, by any other means, motives, or perſwaſions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, without being inveſted with an hope, and this pregnant and lively, of as great things as the Goſpel promiſeth to be poſſeſſed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in due time. Of the ſame import is this alſo of the Apoſtle <hi>John, And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himſelf, even as he is pure,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.3. The Particle and Pronoun, <hi>this,</hi> is emphatical; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that it is the Prerogative, or ſignal priviledge of that <hi>hope,</hi> which he had immediately before mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. to ſet men on work to purifie themſelves, according to that great Exemplar of all purity and holineſs, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that none other <hi>hope</hi> but <hi>this</hi> [either formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or materially] nor any, nor all other means, without it, are able to engage the Sons or Daughters of men about ſo heroick and heavenly a work. Now, <hi>this hope,</hi> of which he ſpeaks, this glorious thing, that it puts every man, that hath it, upon purifying himſelf by the beſt pattern, and as near unto it as he is able (humane infirmity conſidered) he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, to be an <hi>hope</hi> of being <hi>like,</hi> or of being made <hi>like</hi> unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in reſpect of his glorified and bleſſed eſtate: which by a near-hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation amounteth to as much as is contained in all thoſe great and precious Promiſes of the Goſpel lately ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, upon this account, touch only one place more (at preſent) though there be very many conſorting with it: <hi>Having therefore theſe Promiſes</hi> [meaning, of that high and ſacred conſequence, as thoſe now mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17, 18. of the preceding Chapter] <hi>let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs both of Fleſh and Spirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. As if he ſhould ſay; Had you only matters of lighter concernment, or leſs deſirableneſs promiſed, and propoſed unto you, for your encouragement and reward than thoſe inſured you by God in the Goſpel, you might much more reaſonably demur upon the exhortation now given you, yea, or abſolutely reject it. I know it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:95016:81"/>is a very tedious and uncouth thing unto you, and next unto death (if not equal to it, yea, or above it) to abandon all Senſuality, to crucifie the Fleſh with all the luſts and deeds thereof, and ſeriouſly to ſtrive after perfection of holineſs both in Fleſh and Spirit. But the things promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and confirmed unto you by God in the Goſpel, are ſo above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure deſirable, and ſuper-tranſcendently glorious, that for the enjoyment of them you ſhall offer no violence at all to your reaſons or judgments; but rather highly ſatisfie and content them by hearkening and ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting unto all that the Exhortation requireth of you. Goſpel Precepts are not to be reconciled with fleſh and bloud, but only by the mediation of Goſpel Promiſes; but theſe are proper to make peace, yea, and more than peace, even mutual love and delight between them. This for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond conſideration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> (According to the import of this laſt particular, and in purſuance of our preſent deſign) it is obſervable, that the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and heroick ſervices performed unto God by the beſt and worthieſt of men are by the Holy Ghoſt ſtill aſcribed unto the deſires and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they had of thoſe magnificent rewards, and that ſuperla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive glory, which he hath promiſed unto thoſe that obey him; which cannot reaſonably imply leſs, than that ſuch deſires and expectations were, amongſt other motives and inducements, which (it is like) ſtrengthened their hand alſo to thoſe great undertakings, predominant in them. That one Chapter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. recordeth many more inſtances in this kind than at preſent we judge needful to inſiſt upon: And the Chapter following one that is much greater than all thoſe. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe Chapters: The reaſon of that ready and ſignal obedience which <hi>Abraham</hi> yielded unto God, when he called him to go out into a ſtrange Country (he knew not whither) where he <hi>dwelt in Tabernacles with Iſaac and Jacob,</hi> is thus expreſſed, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. <hi>For he looked for a City, which hath foundations, whoſe builder and maker is God.</hi> So that which enabled him to another as great an act of ſubmiſſion unto God, if not a greater; I mean, the offering up of his only Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> in ſacrifice unto him upon his Command, is intimated to have been a certain expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and hope, that according to the import of this Declaration or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made unto him, <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy Seed be called,</hi> God being able to do it, would raiſe him up from the dead, in caſe he had been actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrificed, <hi>ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19. Thoſe moſt eminent and renouned ſtrains of Self-denial in <hi>Moſes,</hi> as that <hi>he refuſed to be called the Son of Pharaoh's Daughter, that he choſe rather to ſuffer affliction with the People of God than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon, that he eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures in Aegypt;</hi> all theſe high actings (I ſay) are aſcribed unto the influence, which the hope of the great things promiſed by God unto thoſe that ſhould quit themſelves with the like faithfulneſs had upon him. For (ſaith the Text) <hi>he had reſpect
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95016:81"/>unto the recompenſe of reward</hi> (ver. 26.) as if it ſhould have been ſaid, It is the leſs to be marvelled, that he ſhould deny himſelf at that moſt worthy and exemplary rate, conſidering that he was ſeriouſly intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and taken up with confident expectations, of thoſe ſoul-raviſhing enjoyments, which he knew God had promiſed unto Self-denying men. Doubeleſs, both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> were perſons of as great ingenuity, of as gracious ſpirits, as great lovers and friends of God, and of all righteouſneſs and goodneſs, as the ordinary, nay, the more choice and improved ſort of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are; yea, and (doubtleſs) theſe worthy Principles were not aſleep in them, when they acted thoſe <hi>magnalia ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> thoſe ſtately things of men which have been mentioned: Yet the Holy Ghoſt (as we have ſeen) attributeth none of thoſe great things done by them unto any of theſe, neither unto the love of God, love of righteouſneſs, or the like, but only unto the inſpirations of thoſe deſires, and hopes of the excellent things, which God had ſet before them, as rewards of their obedience, which wrought in them (reſpectively.) By the way then, that Doctrine, which teacheth it to be unlawful to ſerve God, or do the beſt actions, with an eye to the reward promiſed unto them, cannot but ſeem very uncouth and ſtrange to conſidering men. Certainly, the expreſs tendency of it, is at once to deſtroy, if it were poſſible, both Nature and Grace out of men. Yea, let me add (upon this occaſion) that were it poſſible, yea, were it never ſo proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or likely, that men out of the meer love of God, or of goodneſs, without any thought of, or reſpect had unto the recompenſe of reward, might or would live holily, and quit themſelves as worthy <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> yet ſhould they ſin in tempting God, and in ſpreading a ſnare in their own way, in caſe they ſhould neglect the great and ſacred Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements which God hath given them by promiſe to ſtrengthen their hand unto ſuch waies. For when God hath preſcribed and vouchſafeth a plurality of means, for the enabling of men to the performance of any duty, it is a ſin, even a tempting both of God and a man's ſelf alſo, to deſpiſe or neglect the uſe of any one of them. But this occaſionally only. If you deſire more inſtances, where the high ſervices of the Saints are imputed, as well ſufferings as doings, unto their deſires and hopes of inheriting the great and precious Promiſes of God, you may at leiſure peruſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 7, 15, 16, 35. of the late mentioned Chapter (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſeems to profeſs himſelf (as it were) a debtor to that <hi>incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Crown</hi> he ſpeaks of, for thoſe high animations, by which he was acted to do, and to ſuffer, at an (almoſt) incredible rate, for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and for the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. from 22, to the end. But the inſtance in this kind, and above all others, is that of the Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> (bleſſed for ever.) It is ſaid of him alſo, that <hi>for the joy that was ſet before him, he endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. It was that <hi>high exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> which God the Father had ſet in the eye of his Faith, that made
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:95016:82"/>that deep <hi>humiliation</hi> paſſable with him, wherein <hi>he deſcended into the lower parts of the Earth</hi> (Eph. 4.9.) having firſt <hi>made himſelf of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> but <hi>took on him the form of a ſervant, and became obedient unto death, even unto the death of the Croſs,</hi> Phil. 2.7, 8. And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when he was now ready to drink that Cup, which was of that horrid taſte unto the humane nature, we find him full of the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that glory which he fully believed would be conferred on him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſufferings, praying unto his Father thus: <hi>And now, O Father, glorifie thou me with thine own ſelf, with the glory which I had with thee before the World was,</hi> Joh. 17.5. The meaning of the Petition ſeems to be this: That whereas the glory of his Godhead had now been veiled many years by his living in the form of a Servant, and was now like to be veiled much more, by ſuffering as a Malefactor, that ignominious and cruel death, which now attended him, his Father would pleaſe to make it fully known unto the World, by ſuch means, as he well knew how to do it, that he was not the perſon, which hitherto, during his abode in the World, he was judged to be, a meer man, but truly and really God, even the ſame God with himſelf. For this (doubtleſs) is <hi>the glory</hi> (the glory of the Godhead) <hi>which he had with the Father before the World was.</hi> This alſo by the way. But pertinent to the Notion in hand (That it was the minding of his Exaltation to enſue that ſupplied him with ſtrength to be baptized with that bloudy Baptiſm which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured) is that which we read concerning an <hi>Angel from Heaven appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, and ſtrengthening him:</hi> When he was ſo earneſt in Prayer with his Father to remove the Cup of his Sufferings from him, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, upon the thoughts of it, to fall into that moſt grievous Agony, in which he ſweat (as it were) drops of bloud, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43, 44. That which the Angel did to <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> him in this ſad condition [that is, to ſupport him in a willingneſs, and contentedneſs of mind, to drink the ſaid Cup from his Father's hand [was (ſay ſome with probability enough) a vigorous and vivid repreſentation to his mind and thoughts of all that moſt ſuperlative glory wherewith he was moſt aſſuredly to be rewarded by God, for, and upon the drinking of it; according to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11. <hi>Wherefore God alſo hath high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exalted him,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore I cannot here but give notice (by the way) that the Note upon the paſſage lately cited from <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. which is found in the Margin of ſome of your larger Bibles of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tranſlation, leading you to a by-ſenſe of the place, is no waies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Holy Ghoſt, nor at all comporting with the ſcope of the Apoſtles diſcourſe. But to open the occaſion of the miſtake in this Note (which ſeems to be a defect, either in the knowledge, or in the memory of the Authors of it, that the Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, for, that is, for the ſake of, as well as in a local ſenſe; in which it ſignifies, for, that is, in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:95016:82"/>the place, or, in the ſtead of another, whether thing or perſon) together with the reaſons evincing that there is a miſtake in it, would occaſion too large a digreſſion. This therefore for a third conſideration towards the demonſtration intended.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Upon the ſame account it is yet further conſiderable, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> that according as men pitch their deſires, either higher; or lower, ſo will they proportion their endeavours for the obtaining of them. The higher the mark is, at which the Archer, or Cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What men judge may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, or procured by weaker or fewer means, they will not put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the trouble or charge of Levying more or greater for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievement. The men that were ſent by <hi>Joſhuah</hi> to view the City of <hi>Ai,</hi> returning, adviſed him thus: <hi>Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thouſand men go up to ſmite Ai, and make not all the people to labour thither: for they are but few,</hi> Joſh. 7.3. It is obſerved, that whilſt the people were fewer, and ſo the Sacrifices fewer, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the work of the Sanctuary ſo much the lighter, and more eaſie to be performed, the <hi>Levites,</hi> and thoſe that were to be employed about it, were taken into the Service not until thirty years of age and upwards, <hi>Num.</hi> 4.3. whereas afterwards, in <hi>David's</hi> time, when the people were encreaſed, and ſo the Sacrifices more numerous, and in that reſpect required more to attend the ſervice about them, the perſons of this charge were, by the order and appoitment of God himſelf, taken into the work from twenty years old and upwards, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.24, 27. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 28.13, 19. Let us now go forward upon this ground. It is little (or rather not at all) que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable, but that Salvation ſimply, or any the inferiour degrees in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may be attained at much lower rates of Sanctity, Zeal, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than thoſe that are more ſublime, and nearer unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: This, beſides that it is rational, and worthy belief of it ſelf, may be proved, above all contradiction, from the anſwer which <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave unto the Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> when they deſired of him to ſit, the one, on his right hand, the other, on his left, in his Kingdom; <hi>Ye know not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what ye ask</hi> [meaning that they did not know, or not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon how arduous and difficult terms or ſervices thoſe high places were to be obtained; as appears by what follows] <hi>Are ye able to drink of the Cup that I ſhall drink of, and to be baptized with the Baptiſm that I am baptized with?</hi> Evidently implying, that thoſe great dignities, which they deſired, were not ſo much as to be thought of (with expectation) but only by perſons who were endued with a ſufficient ſtrength of Faith, and Love to glorifie God by the deepeſt ſufferings. Yea, it appears from the words of his reply to their Anſwer, wherein they had ſaid unto him: <hi>They were able</hi> [<hi>viz. to drink of his Cup,</hi> &amp;c.] that ſimple Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95016:83"/>it ſelf, without other qualifications of Excellency and Worth, in conjunction with it, was not able to reach the height of theſe places. For are not his words theſe? <hi>Ye ſhall drink indeed of my Cup, and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the Baptiſm that I am baptized with: But to ſit on my right hand and on my left, is not mine to give, but unto thoſe for whom it is prepared of my Father,</hi> Mat. 20.23. of the rendring, and meaning of which latter words we ſpake formerly in this Reaſon: Let us now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a ſtep further upon the ground on which we ſtand. If Salvation ſimply, or an entrance into the Kingdom of Glory may be obtained in the lower waies of Godlineſs, and men in their deſires deſign no more, nothing higher than theſe; certain it is, from the unqueſtionable ground on which we now argue, that men will not provoke, or ſtrain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to walk in the upper or higher waies of Godlineſs for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, at leaſt, if they be ſatisfied in their Judgments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that the lower waies, we ſpeak of, will carry them up to them. And now upon the Premiſes let us gather up to our intended Concluſion. If it be the duty of all the Saints and Servants of God to lift up their hearts and hands to the higheſt, and holieſt, and greateſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and every one to ſtrive to go before other in adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Profeſſion, and magnifying the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the World (which I preſume is no man's doubt or queſtion) then muſt it needs be their duty alſo to aſcend up in their deſires unto thoſe Manſions in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; in which they ſhall be as near Neighbours unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf as may be, and not content themſelves with ſeeking meerly to be ſaved, and to eſcape hell fire. The Reaſon of this Conſequence is evident from the Premiſes, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Men will not riſe higher in their endeavours, or in the uſe of means for obtaining the ends projected, and deſired by them, than they judge neceſſary for their attainment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it cannot (lightly) but be known, and concluded, by the Saints, that they muſt quit themſelves at another manner of rate, in all <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Worth and Godlineſs, to be made capable of ſitting at the right hand and left of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Kingdom, or in any of the places near adjoyning than is neceſſary to give them a bare entrance into this Kingdom. Deſires and hopes of the leſſer and lower enjoyments in Heaven, will not wind up their hearts to that height of zeal and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the glory of God, and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which the greater things there would do, were they ardently deſired, and accordingly hoped for and expected. It is ſomewhat more than probable unto me, that the neglect of that duty, the face whereof we have now endeavoured to unveil (I mean, the duty of deſiring, and deſigning, not the bare, but the <hi>heaped up</hi> meaſure of Salvation) hath occaſioned and bred that dwarfe generation of Profeſſing Chriſtians, which I cannot ſuddenly reſolve, whether I ſhould rather call the ſhame or the honour of the Churches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the World.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:95016:83"/>
               <p>Fifthly (and laſtly; For I ſhall propoſe only one conſideration more (and this very briefly) for the clearing up of that truth, which we are now pleading) The deſire, not ſimply of good, but of that which is the beſt for us, and ſo apprehended by us, is planted by God himſelf in the frame of the nature of man. This Aſſertion (I conceive) needs no proof, being, if not one of thoſe common Notions (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) with the knowledge or belief of which men are prompted by nature, without diſcourſe, yet very near of kin unto ſundry of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Reaſon (in a word) evinceth it. If there were in men only a deſire of that which is ſimply and poſitively good, and not of that which is ſuperlatively good, or beſt of all; than whenſoever that which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſitively good, or good in a lower degree, and that which is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently good, are ſet together before them, though they ſhould appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the difference between them; yet ſhould they be neceſſitated in their choice, or deſires, to that which is evil (for ſo a leſſer good is, in reſpect of a greater) and not at liberty to chuſe, or deſire that which is really and abſolutely good for them. Therefore (doubtleſs) there is in every man by nature from the God thereof an inclination or deſire unto that which they apprehend to be beſt for them, all circumſtances conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and weighed together. I remember a Saying of one of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſomewhat to this purpoſe, <hi>Etiam perditâ felicitate, voluntatem felicitatis non perdidimus.</hi> Though we have loſt our happineſs, yet have we not loſt our will, or deſire of being happy. Now all deſires, or inclinations, which are in men from God, ought to be cheriſhed, ſtrengthened, and improved by them: Nor are they at liberty to neglect, or ſuffer them to languiſh, or to loſe any thing of their native force or vigour within them. For they are implanted in them by God, to lead them into ſuch waies, and unto ſuch actions, whereby himſelf, as the Author and Donor of them, may be glorified, and themſelves, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their conduct, be made meet to be rewarded by him. So then, the Saints, as they are men, being inveſted by God, not with deſires of things that are ſimply good, but of the things that are of greateſt and beſt concernment unto them, when they may be had, ſtand bound in duty to nouriſh and maintain theſe deſires, and not to deſpiſe, or turn aſide from them. From whence it clearly follows, That it is not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of indifferency, or what they may do, or not do as they pleaſe; but a matter of duty, and of obedience unto God, to awaken and ſtir up deſires in them after the greateſt enjoyments in Heaven; knowing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that theſe may be obtained by waies and means both honourable, and ſuch which are, or may be, by ſeeking unto God accordingly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their power to uſe.</p>
               <p>But two things may be here ſaid: 1. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> The Saints may be ignorant whether they be under any poſſibility of obtaining thoſe greater things in Heaven you ſpeak of, what means ſoever they ſhall uſe in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:95016:84"/>How then ſhould they deſire them? It being a true Notion, as well in Divinity as Philoſophy, that <hi>voluntas non vult impoſſibile:</hi> The will never willeth that [with a ſettled, or deliberate act of willing] the attainment whereof a man judgeth to be impoſſible unto him.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; That if any of the Saints be ignorant of ſuch a thing, it is their ſin, and ſuch their ignorance is not juſtifiable: and therefore it cannot excuſe them under the omiſſion of that which otherwiſe is their duty to do; although the difficulty of overcoming it, being in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree conſiderable, may qualifie, in part, the guilt of it; and ſo likewiſe of that other ſin which it occaſioneth. For though I judge it too hard to call it an affected ignorance in any of the Saints: Yet I fear, that in many of them it may, without any breach of charity, be termed, a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary or willing ignorance; becauſe it may, by a diligent ſearch into, and pondering and comparing of the Scriptures, be clearly found (God being no reſpecter of perſons, and ſtanding declared that he will judge, and reward every man according to his works) that any perſon of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that will advance, and lay out himſelf in waies and works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and true holineſs, accordingly, may receive from him a Crown of the greateſt weight of glory.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It may be ſaid to the Argument laſt propounded, That the Saints, at leaſt a great part of them, do verily judge or think, that, all things conſidered, as the weakneſs of their Faith, their undergrowth in knowledge, the unrulineſs and unſubduedneſs of their fleſh, and the intolerable burthen it would be unto it to be compelled to keep them company in the ſevere Exerciſes of Mortification, and high acts of Self-denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which muſt be performed by thoſe that look to lift up their heads in glory above other their Brethren, the Saints in Heaven) and withal how full of joy and bleſſed contentment it will be unto them, if they ſhall be counted meet to enjoy, be it the meaneſt place amongſt thoſe that are ſaved; theſe things (I ſay, haply with many more) conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they may conclude, that it is beſt for them to content themſelves with deſigning nothing higher than Salvation ſimply; or the ſcanteſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Heaven, and not to lift up their deſires unto the heights of glory there. Therefore the conſideration mentioned doth not put them to rebuke; although they do not deſire part and fellowſhip in the higheſt advancements in Heaven.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; That it is an Objection, or Plea, ſavouring of the Fleſh, though it may expreſs the caſe of perſons (in ſome degree) ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. It is ſomewhat of kin to that award of the ſluggard (who, as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> informeth us, is wont to be <hi>wiſe in his own conceit,</hi> Prov. 26.16.) between <hi>one handful,</hi> and <hi>two;</hi> when <hi>one</hi> may be had with eaſe and quietneſs, but <hi>two</hi> not without labour and trouble. <hi>Better</hi> (ſaith the Wiſeman, ſpeaking of the ſpirit of ſuch a <hi>fool,</hi> as he here calls him) <hi>is an handful with quietneſs, than both the hands full with travel and vexation
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95016:84"/>of ſpirit,</hi> Eccleſ. 4.6. For he that judgeth it beſt for him to pitch his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires upon getting into Heaven only, and not to ſtrain, or raiſe them to the beſt and greateſt of the enjoyments here; let this his judgment proceed upon what Reaſons or Conſiderations ſoever, yet will it be found Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and therefore cannot acquit him from ſin that ſhall build or act upon it. For the Circumſtances mentioned in the Objection, weakneſs in Faith, under-growth in Knowledge, unſubduedneſs of the Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe being all ſinful defects and imperfections, cannot juſtifie ſuch an act which under due Circumſtances would be ſinful.</p>
               <p>But enough (if not more than ſo) hath been argued, to evince it, not ſimply lawful, but even neceſſary, as Duty makes Actions neceſſary for the Saints and Servants of God, to kindle a ſpirit of this holy and heavenly Ambition: even to deſire to be as great in the Kingdom of Heaven as the greateſt of them all; I mean, of the greateſt of thoſe whom the Grace and Spirit of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſhall bring thither. And thus (I truſt) we have made good the ſecond thing ſuppoſed in the fift and laſt reaſon of our Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Saints are under an Obligation of Duty to put themſelves into a capacity of the moſt ſublime inveſtitures with glory, which God hath prepared for the Children of men.</p>
               <p>That which was aſſertively laid down, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> and affirmed in this Reaſon, was, that unleſs men ſhall be <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> (in the ſenſe declared towards the beginning) they are never like to be in any capacity of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelves into a capacity of ſuch inveſtitures, or of ſitting in any of the uppermoſt ſeats at that Table, at which the Saints ſhall eat bread with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the Kingdom of God. But for the proof and confirmation of this, we ſhall not need to add any thing to what we have ſo largely argued from the Scriptures in our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the fourth ground and reaſon of the Doctrine. It muſt not be a ſparing, or a thin, but a very rich anointing with the Spirit, that will prepare and ſtrengthen men ſo to <hi>wreſtle againſt principalities, againſt powers, againſt the Rulers of the darkneſs of this World, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places</hi> [or, heavenly things] yea, and againſt their own fleſh and bloud alſo (for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We ſhall now proceed to the Uſe and Application of the Doctrine. Only there are two or three Queſtions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Doctrine delivered, that being cleared will (I conceive) give ſome further light into it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Three Queſtions propounded, to give further light into the Doctrine; The firſt of them enquired into, namely, who, or what this Spirit (mentioned in the Tex) is, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether he be an increated Spirit, even God bleſſed for ever; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a created Spirit? Several Scriptures opened and argued (both from the Old and New Teſtament) proving that the Spirit, ſpoken of in the Text, is none other than <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or the moſt high God. The ſeveral Pleas brought againſt theſe Scriptures, by perſons contrary minded, taken off, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered invalid. As alſo ſome Grounds in Reaſon propounded and argued to prove that the Holy Ghoſt is very God.</head>
               <p>THe firſt of theſe Queſtions (being occaſioned by ſome unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py importune ſpirits of Error lately gotten abroad amongſt us) ſhall be this: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> Who, or what this Spirit, mentioned in the Text, and much ſpoken of in the Doctrine, is? Or more particularly, whether he be an infinite, and increated Spirit; one of the Three which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith; <hi>are one,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.7. commonly known amongſt us by the name of Three Perſons (ſome weaker Judgments do not like the expreſſion.) Or whether he be ſome excellent Creature, ſome high-born Angel, or the like; who is near unto God? This is the firſt Queſtion which we ſhall a little ſearch into, Whether the Spirit of God, ſometimes, yea, oft in Scripture called the Holy Ghoſt, be truly God, or a Creature? The ſecond ſhall be this, How, or in what reſpect, and when a perſon, man or woman, may be ſaid to be filled with the Spirit, and ſo may be ſaid to have obeyed the voice of the Exhortation of the Apoſtle? The third (and laſt) ſhall be, How a man, or woman, that is indeed <hi>filled with the Spirit of God</hi> may be known from a perſon which is filled with another ſpirit, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſpirit of Vanity and Deluſion? There is a fourth Queſtion, every whit as neceſſary and edifying as any of theſe, which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak ſomewhat unto after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when we come to the Exhortation; The Tenour of which Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will be this: How, and by what means, men and women may come to be <hi>filled with the Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the Queſtion firſt propounded: Who, or what this Spirit, or the Spirit of God ſhould be, whether God, an increated Spirit, or
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:95016:85"/>whether a created Spirit? Many of you that are preſent (I ſuppoſe) know that there is an <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> Spirit that hath broken priſon of late, and gotten abroad amongſt as, very buſie in making Proſelytes: And as in the daies of Old this Spirit, laboured to fill the World with this Doctrine: That only one of the Three (which <hi>John,</hi> as you heard, ſaith, <hi>are one</hi>) <hi>viz.</hi> He that is known unto us by the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is truly God: And that the other two, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, or the Spirit, are but the Father's Creatures, receiving, though very excellent, yet only finite, and limited Being from him. Wherefore, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Aaron</hi> (Num. 16.46.) <hi>There is wrath gone out from the Lord, the Plague is begun;</hi> and hereupon wiſheth him <hi>to go quickly unto the Congregation to make attonement for them:</hi> Even ſo the Plague of this moſt dangerous Errour we ſpeak of, being begun amongſt us already, and ſeveral being intangled, and inſnared by it; It therefore concerns thoſe who are in a ſpecial manner intruſted with the great concernments both of God, and men, and upon whoſe ſhoulders it lieth (more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) to contend for the truth: I ſay, it concerns them to lay about them with all wiſdom and faithfulneſs in order to the convincing gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, or the Adverſaries of this Truth.</p>
               <p>We do not intend at preſent to ſpeak any thing directly, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for the vindication of the God-head of the Second Perſon: The Name by which he is beſt known unto us, is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> But only to plead the cauſe of him, whom we (with the ancient Chriſtians) call the Third Perſon in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> or the Holy Ghoſt: and briefly from the Scriptures to demonſtrate him to be an infinite, and uncreated Spirit, and truly God. Amongſt very many paſſages, as well in the Old as in the New Teſtament, which with greateſt evidence demonſtrate the Holy Ghoſt to be God, we ſhall only inſiſt upon ſome few, which we judge to be moſt clear and convincing. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Jehovah</hi> (tranſlated Lord) ſpeaketh thus to <hi>Moſes, Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou ſhalt ſay.</hi> From hence it appears, that it is only proper for <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or him that is God, to be in the mouth of the Prophets, and to teach them what to ſay. Add hereunto, that which we have, <hi>Num.</hi> 12.6. <hi>And he ſaid, hear now my words, If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord</hi> (or, <hi>I Jehovah</hi>) <hi>will make my ſelf known unto him in a viſion, and will ſpeak unto him in a dream.</hi> Now moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is from hence, that he who ſpake by the Prophets, and other Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God, as the Apoſtles, was true <hi>Jehovah,</hi> true God. And hence it was, that when the Prophets were about to deliver any Meſſage to the People in the Name of God, they commonly uſed this Preface, <hi>Thus ſaith Jehovah, or the word of Jehovah, that Jehovah ſpake unto them, or appeared unto them;</hi> or the like places, of this kind are without number in the Writings of the Prophets. And the Apoſtle himſelf (<hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1.) expreſly ſaith, <hi>That God in times paſt ſpake unto the Fathers
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:95016:86"/>by the Prophets.</hi> Now the Lord Chriſt himſelf affirmeth, That it is the Spirit of God, or the Holy Ghoſt, that thus ſpeaketh in men, <hi>Take no thought how, or what ye ſhall ſpeak, for it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father ſpeaketh in you,</hi> Mat. 10.19. Therefore now, if it, was God that ſpake by the Prophets then, and is interpreted by Chriſt to be the Holy Ghoſt, then <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or the Lord in the Old Teſtament, is the Spirit, or the Holy Ghoſt in the New. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly affirmeth, that it was <hi>the Spirit of Chriſt that ſpake in the Prophets,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. And elſewhere he ſaith, that <hi>Holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21. Thus <hi>David</hi> alſo a little before his departure, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſpake by me, and his word was in my tongue; The God of Iſrael ſaid, the Rock of Iſrael ſpake to me,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.2. And ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.2. <hi>And the Spirit entred into me when he ſpake unto me.</hi> So that evident it is from theſe Scriptures, diligently compared and laid together, that the Holy Ghoſt, who is from place to place ſaid to have ſpoke unto the Prophets, and Holy men of God, was none other but <hi>Jehovah,</hi> God himſelf. Another place may be <hi>Lev</hi> 19.1, 2. where <hi>Jehovah</hi> is ſaid to have ſpake unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Speak unto all the Congregation of the Children of Iſrael, and ſay unto them, Ye ſhall be holy: for I the Lord your God am holy.</hi> Now he that ſpake theſe words unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ordered all theſe Ceremonies, is in the New Teſtament ſaid to be the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt this ſignifying,</hi> &amp;c. Yet again, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.12. <hi>And I will walk among you, and be your God, and ye ſhall be my people,</hi> compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. In all theſe places you ſhall find that the Saints in their Holy Aſſemblies are ſaid to be the Temple of God, and that God is ſaid to be there, and to walk amongſt them. <hi>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</hi> 1 Cor. 3.16. So again, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. <hi>For the Temple of God is holy, which Temple ye are,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19. <hi>What, know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c? 2 Cor. 6.16. <hi>What agreement hath the Temple of God with Idols? For ye are the Temple of the living God,</hi> &amp;c. Now theſe perſons (you ſee) in whom God is ſaid to dwell, are ſaid to be the <hi>Temple of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And that God that dwelleth amongſt them is the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Alſo in Horeb ye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Lord, ſo that the Lord was angry with you,</hi> compared with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10. <hi>But they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit.</hi> That, which in the former place is termed, <hi>a provoking the Lord unto wrath,</hi> ſo that he was <hi>angry,</hi> Is in the latter, by the Evangelical Prophet, termed, <hi>a vexing of his holy Spirit,</hi> Pſal. 95.7, 8. The Pſalm begins thus, <hi>Come let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce unto Jehovah;</hi> And ſoon after, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice,</hi> &amp;c. He that conteſted with, and complained of the People in the Wilderneſs was true <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as appears alſo from ſeveral other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: <hi>And they tempted God in the Deſart,</hi> Pſal. 106.14. and Pſal. 78.18. Yet the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7. plainly affirms, that it was the Holy
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:95016:86"/>Ghoſt that was tempted; wherefore, as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts,</hi> &amp;c. So that you ſee by theſe, and many other ſuch like, places (which might be readily produced, if need were) that he, called <hi>Jehovah, the Lord of Hoſts</hi> in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, is called the Holy Ghoſt in the New. Yet again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9, 10. The Prophet in the beginning of this Chapter ſeeth in a Viſion the <hi>Lord Jehovah</hi> ſitting on a high Throne, with Seraphims about it. Afterwards, about the ninth and tenth verſes, he ſignifies unto them the obſtinacy and obduration of the Jews, whereupon the Prophet had a Meſſage from the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi> to declare unto this People, which was this, <hi>Make the heart of this people fat,</hi> &amp;c. Now the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> plainly affirms, (<hi>Acts</hi> 28.25.) That it was the Holy Ghoſt, by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that had foretold this their obſtinacy and obduration. Yet once more, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.16. <hi>And now the Lord God, and his Spirit hath ſent me.</hi> He here clearly attributes the ſame act of miſſion, or ſending unto the Spirit of God, which he attributes unto God the Father himſelf. He doth not ſay, that God ſent him with his Spirit, or furniſhed, or filled with his Spirit: but his Spirit joyned in the ſame act of ſending. Laſtly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31. <hi>Behold the daies come</hi> (ſaith the Lord <hi>Jehovah</hi>) <hi>that I will make a new Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.15.</p>
               <p>Againſt theſe Teſtimonies produced from the Old Teſtament, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> to prove the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt, and the management of them in order thereunto; the Spirit, which contradicteth this Doctrine, hath this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception (in general) to diſable the validity of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That though the ſame things be aſcribed in the New Teſtament to the Holy Ghoſt which are attributed to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or God himſelf in the Old (for this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the common ſinew of theſe proofs;) yet (ſaith this Spirit) this proveth not that the Holy Ghoſt is God, becauſe the ſame things, the ſame actions, wherein God and the Creature joyn, may be attributed either to the one or the other, and are (in Scripture) ſometimes attributed to the one, and ſometimes to the other: For inſtance, becauſe the converting and ſaving of men are actions wherein God, and the Creature man (as well the Miniſter of the Goſpel as the perſon himſelf who is conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) do co-operate, and act joyntly; therefore theſe actions, or effects, are aſcribed ſometimes to the one, and ſometimes to the other. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converſion, or turning of men is aſcribed unto God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.4, &amp;c. To the Miniſter, and others inſtrumental in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of men <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.20. To the perſons themſelves conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.25. So the act of ſaving is aſcribed unto God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. And yet unto men alſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.20, &amp;c. So again (to give another inſtance) <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or God himſelf is ſaid to have brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt, Exod.</hi> 20.2. and in very many places beſides: Yet <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo is ſaid to have brought them forth likewiſe, becauſe he joyned with God, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:95016:87"/>was ſubſervient unto him in the Action, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Num.</hi> 16.13. In like manner, ſay they, who deny the Holy Ghoſt to be God; that the ſame things are aſcribed to <hi>Jehovah,</hi> God in the Old Teſtament, which are aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt in the New, yet doth it not prove the Holy Ghoſt to be God: but only that the Holy Ghoſt is ſubſervient unto God, or hath part and fellowſhip in theſe actions, which he may have though he be a creature. To all which I reply.</p>
               <p>That though one and the ſame Action may be aſcribed to ſeveral Agents really, yea, and ſpecifically diſtinct the one from the other, (as God and the Creature are) when they have a joynt Agency in the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet it doth not follow from hence but that the ſame Action may be aſcribed, in ſeveral places, to one and the ſame Agent under different names, and appellations: or that becauſe that Action which in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is expreſly aſcribed unto <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or God, is aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt in the New, therefore the Holy Ghoſt muſt needs be a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not the ſame <hi>Jehovah</hi> with him, to whom it is aſcribed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: As becauſe he that is ſaid to have reigned in <hi>Joſiahs</hi> ſtead is called <hi>Jehoahaz,</hi> 2 Kings 23.30. So again, 2 <hi>Chron</hi> 36.2. it doth not follow that therefore it was not the ſame perſon who is called <hi>Shallum, Jer.</hi> 22.11. and here ſaid to have reigned in <hi>Joſiahs</hi> ſtead alſo. So again, becauſe the ſame act of ariſing and following Chriſt upon his call, which is aſcribed unto <hi>Matthew,</hi> Mat. 9.9. is aſcribed unto <hi>Levi, Mar.</hi> 2.14. it doth not follow, that therefore <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> muſt needs be two diſtinct perſons. In like manner it doth not follow, that becauſe the the ſame things which are aſcribed unto <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or God in the Old Teſtament, are aſcribed unto the Holy Ghoſt in the New; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt muſt needs be two diſtinct Agents.</p>
               <p>If it be here replied and ſaid, yea, but this Reply of yours doth all this while but only prove, that <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the Old Teſtament may be the ſame Agent with the Holy Ghoſt in the New, notwithſtanding the diverſity of Names uſed in the one, and in the other; but this doth not prove that they are, or muſt of neceſſity be the ſame. For the reaſon formerly mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe one and the ſame Action may be, and oft is in the Scripture attributed to two ſeveral Agents ſpecifically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. To this I reply.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If it be proved, and granted that the Holy Ghoſt (ſo called) in the New Teſtament may be the ſame with <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the Old, this reacheth ſo far (at leaſt) as to abate the confidence of that opinion, which denieth them to be the ſame, or that the Holy Ghoſt is truly God. For if it be true, that the Holy Ghoſt may be <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or true God, then is not the contrary demonſtrable by any argument or proof whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>viz.</hi> that he is not God. For that which is demonſtrably, ſo or ſo, ſuch or ſuch, there is no poſſibility that it ſhould be altered, or not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:95016:87"/>ſo, or ſuch, as it is demonſtrated to be. So that though it ſhould be granted that the exception made againſt the proofs inſiſted upon, to prove the Holy Ghoſt to be God, doth ſo far take off the validity of them that they do not conclude the Affirmative, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt is God; yet do they remain in ſo much ſtrength, this exception notwithſtanding, as to conclude that He may be God; and conſequently, that the Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which ſaith He is not God, may be falſe. If it be here ſaid, it is true, your reply wherein you prove that the Scriptures ſometimes aſcribe the ſame action in ſeveral places to the ſame Perſon or Agent, under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral names; this proves that the Holy Ghoſt, in the New Teſtament ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame things aſcribed unto him which <hi>Jehovah</hi> in the Old, may notwithſtanding this variety of name, or appellation, be the ſame with him: But this proves not but that upon ſome other account, and for other reaſons it may be impoſſible that they ſhould be the ſame. As he that is in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.30. called <hi>Jehoahas,</hi> and he that is in <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.11. called <hi>Shallum,</hi> may notwithſtanding this diverſity of appellation be the ſame Perſon: But yet there may be other conſiderations which make it evident that they are not, nor can be the ſame. To this we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: It is true, if there be any ſuch conſideration, or ground by which it may be ſubſtantially proved, that the Holy Ghoſt is a created Angel, and not <hi>Jehovah,</hi> then that diverſity of appellation we ſpeak of will not evince ſo much as a may be, or a poſſibility of their being the ſame. But that all the reaſons that have been yet levied (ſo far as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known, or have been heard of) to prove this impoſſibility, I mean, that they ſhould not be the ſame are defective, and fall ſhort of any ſuch proof ſhall (God willing) be made appear in due time. but,</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the ſaid proofs, notwithſtanding the ſaid Anſwer, or exception made to them, do ſufficiently conclude the <hi>Jehovah</hi> of the Old Teſtament in the Texts cited, and the Holy Ghoſt in the New, to be one and the ſame, appears by the light of this conſideration: Becauſe it is the genius, or property of the New Teſtament to enlighten the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Old, and ſtill in mentioning the tranſactions, or ſayings thereof, to ſpeak more plainly, fully, and particularly, according to that common Saying; That the New Teſtament is nothing elſe but the Old with the veil of obſcurity taken off from the face of it. As the Old is nothing but the New with the ſame veil ſpread upon it. Inſtances of what we now affirm, <hi>viz.</hi> that the New Teſtament, ſpeaking of the paſſages of the Old, ſpeaketh more expreſly, and particularly thoſe things, which the Old ſpeaketh more generally, and obſcurely, are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and every where to be found. We ſhall at preſent only mention one which is of ſome affinity with the buſineſs in hand; They who with ſtood <hi>Moſes</hi> in his applications unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by way of miracles and wonders to perſwade him to ſuffer the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to depart out of his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95016:88"/>Land, are mentioned in the Old Teſtament but by the general names of Sorcerers, Magicians, and Inchanters, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.11. but the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſpeaking of them, calls them, by their proper names, <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.8. Thus, He which the Old Teſtament, in all the Texts and places cited, ſtiles <hi>Jehovah,</hi> God, which is a general name common to all the Three ſubſiſting in the Divine Nature, or Eſſence; the New Teſtament, ſpeaking of him, terms him the Holy Ghoſt, which is the name appropriate to the third Perſon there ſubſiſting. And if we ſhall ſuppoſe that the Old Teſtament aſcribes ſuch things plainly, expreſly, and without Parable unto <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or God himſelf, which the New Teſtament aſcribes unto ſuch a creature which no man knows what to make of him, nor what kind of Creature he is (for ſuch muſt the Holy Ghoſt needs be ſuppoſed to be, if we make a Creature of him:) It is a plain caſe, that the Old Teſtament ſhall be light, where the New is dark, and what the Old ſpeaks plainly the New ſhall ſpeak obſcurely, which is contrary (as hath been ſaid) to the nature of it, and the Counſel of God in it; For that the Holy Ghoſt is by them, who deny his Godhead, affirmed to be a created Angel, one, or more, ſome Archangel, or the like, is but <hi>gratìs dictum,</hi> affirmed at peradventure, and cannot be proved, not ſo much as by one Argument of any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent probability.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if the Holy Ghoſt ſhall be ſuppoſed to be a creature never ſo well known, as ſuppoſe to be ſome great Angel; yet in caſe it ſhould be ſuppoſed, that what the Old Teſtament expreſly aſcribeth unto God, the New Teſtament, having occaſion to ſpeak of the ſame thing, ſhould aſcribe it to this Angel; then the New Teſtament muſt be ſuppoſed to ſpeak ſhort of the Old, and with loſs and diſadvantage as to matter of edification unto the World: For inſtance, where the Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.15. a place formerly inſiſted on) makes the Holy Ghoſt witneſs of this great Evangelical truth, or ſaying, <hi>viz. That Chriſt by one offering hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for ever them that are ſanctified;</hi> if we ſhall ſuppoſe the Holy Ghoſt to be but a Creature, we muſt ſuppoſe withal that this Apoſtle doth diminiſh the weight, credit, and authority of that important ſaying, in compariſon of what the Old Teſtament giveth unto it, where it maketh <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or God himſelf the Author and Aſſertor of it. For (as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaith) <hi>if we receive the witneſs of men:</hi> So we ſay, If we receive the witneſs of an Angel, <hi>the witneſs of God is greater, i.e.</hi> Is to be received, and believed with far leſs ſcruple, or heſitancie of mind, or rather with far more readineſs of mind, with a far more raiſedneſs, and enlargement of confidence and aſſurance of truth than the witneſs of an Angel. So that if the Old Teſtament ſhall be conceived to build the judgments and conſciences of men touching the truth of the Goſpel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the authority or teſtimony of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or God himſelf, and the New upon the credit only of an Angel; the Old Teſtament ſhall give
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:95016:88"/>the good meaſure of peace and comfort, heaped up, preſſed down, and running over, and the New only that which is ſcant and bare.</p>
               <p>Yet again, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> If the Holy Ghoſt in that other place (<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.8. inſiſted on likewiſe) ſhall be ſuppoſed to be an Angel, or Creature, then it will follow.</p>

               <p>The Apoſtle (<hi>Heb.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3.) having in the beginning of the Chapter declared ſome particulars of the <hi>Worldly Sanctuary</hi> (as he calls it) under the firſt Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> the Candleſtick and Table for the Shew-bread in the outer part of the Tabernacle, called the Holy place as alſo the golden Cenſer, the Ark overlaid with Gold, with the golden Pot wherein Manna was kept, and <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod that budded, having over it Cherubims of Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of all which (he ſaith) he could not at preſent ſpeak parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly: He goeth on thus, <hi>Ver.</hi> 6, 7, 8.

                  </gap>, The Holy Ghoſt this ſignifying.</p>
               <p n="1">1. (As we ſaid) If by the Holy Ghoſt here be meant an Angel, one or more, then muſt the Angels be ſuppoſed to have underſtood the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Chriſt, and all the deep ſecrets of the Goſpel, even from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> his daies at leaſt, and this very punctually and exactly: For to be able to read a Lecture upon, and to give the ſpiritual ſenſe and ſignification of all the Types and Figures under the Levitical Law, argues an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of knowledge in the whole myſtery of Chriſt; Whereas the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the Goſpel in his daies, calls it a <hi>myſtery, which from the beginning of the world had been hid in God,</hi> Eph. 3.9, 10. And that we ſhould not interpret this concealment, or hiding of it in God, with limitation unto men only, as if it had been revealed unto Angels long before, though not unto men. He immediately adds (in the next verſe) <hi>To the intent that now unto the Principalities, and powers in heavenly places, might be known by the Church the manifold wiſdom of God;</hi> therefore (queſtionleſs) no Creature, nor Angel whatſoever, had any ſuch parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity of knowledge of the myſtery of the Goſpel, as the clear under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Types of the Law import, until the coming of Chriſt
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:95016:89"/>in the fleſh, yea, untill the coming down of that golden ſhower of the the Holy Ghoſt in that viſible manner upon the Apoſtles in the day of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> Acts 2.1, 2. And that the Angels were little other than ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the myſteries of the Goſpel in <hi>Peter's</hi> daies ſeems clear from that Paſſage, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. where ſpeaking of the great and excellent myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Goſpel he calleth them things into which the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, deſire (by bowing or bending of themſelves) to look or prie into. Where (obſerve) it is very remarkable to our preſent purpoſe, that the Apoſtle makes a plain oppoſition or diſtinction between the Holy Ghoſt and Angels, <hi>Unto whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, that not unto themſelves, but unto us they did miniſter the things which are now reported unto you, by them that have preached the Goſpel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, with [or by] the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from Heaven, which things the Angels deſire to look into.</hi> If the Holy Ghoſt, which he here ſaith was ſent down from Heaven, had been an Angel, he would (in reaſon) not have ſaid which things the Angels deſire to look into, but rather into which the other Angels, or the reſt of the Angels deſire to look: This had been an intimation (indeed) that the Holy Ghoſt had been an Angel.</p>
               <p>If it be here pretended (by way of reply) that when the Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to have <hi>ſignified</hi> ſuch and ſuch Evangelical myſteries by ſuch and ſuch types and ſhadows of the Law, it is not neceſſarily implied, that therefore he muſt needs underſtand theſe ſignifications, or relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the type and the ſpiritual thing typified; but only, and ſimply that he imparted unto <hi>Moſes</hi> theſe types and figures, by which were ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified ſuch and ſuch myſteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this I anſwer,</p>
               <p>Then according to this ſuppoſition it muſt be conceived that the Holy Ghoſt learned his Leſſon by rote from God, and received wiſdom or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from him to deliver unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> the ſenſe or meaning whereof he underſtood not: whereas the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the Holy Ghoſt, or the Spirit of God, ſaith of him that <hi>he doth,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

Now if he enableth men to diſcover and underſtand the deep things of God, certainly he muſt needs be conceived to know and underſtand them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He that teacheth man knowledge, ſhall not he know?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Holy Ghoſt (in the Scripture in hand) be a created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, and not <hi>Jehovah,</hi> true, or truly God, then doth it plainly follow from hence, that the Angels, one or more, ſhould be the Architects, Founders, and Framers of the whole <hi>Moſaical</hi> Oeconomy, and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical</hi> Diſpenſation: For he that gave theſe types and figures theſe reſpective ſignifications, and appointed that Ceremony to ſignifie one
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:95016:89"/>thing, and this another, was doubtleſs the Author and Founder of them; as he that gives ſuch properties, or parts unto things, that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and eſſential to them, is certainly the Creator of them; As he that gives ſuch properties, and qualities, and parts to the natural bodies which are intrinſical, and eſſential unto them, muſt be their Maker and Creator: In like manner, he that gives types and ſhadows to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, muſt needs be their Author and Founder.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, But might not <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf be ſaid to ſignifie ſuch and ſuch things, by ſuch and ſuch Ordinances, Rites, and Ceremonies adminiſtred by him, in caſe theſe Ordinances and Rites do indeed and in truth ſignifie ſuch things? And if ſo, Why may not the Angel alſo that revealed or imparted theſe things unto him? I reply.</p>
               <p>Though the things, or Types themſelves may (in a ſenſe) be ſaid to ſignifie ſuch or ſuch things, yet he, that only adminiſters theſe Types by order from another, cannot (in any tolerable conſtruction) be ſaid to ſignifie ſuch a thing, eſpecially, if it be ſuppoſed that he underſtand not their ſignification. Now if the Holy Ghoſt were an Angel, then he did not underſtand the ſignification, and ſubſtance, and relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Type, and the Evangelical things typified, or imparted by them, and then in no tolerable conſtruction of words can be ſaid to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. (And laſtly) If by the Holy Ghoſt (in the place before us) ſhall be meant an Angel, the Tenour of the words will be low, uncouth, and poor in compariſon of that height and lip of excellency wherewith he ſpake. To ſay that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould thus ſignifie, whereas it was only an Angel that did thus ſignifie; this would not look like one of the Sayings of the living God, therefore the ſenſe of the place cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be any other but <hi>Jehovah,</hi> God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Having evinced from ſeveral Teſtimonies in the Old Teſtament (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto many more of like import might readily have been added) the Deity or Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> And having vindicated the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of proof lying in thoſe Teſtimonies againſt ſuch objections, as thoſe that are contrary minded either are wont, or able to raiſe againſt the ſame; we now proceed to the New Teſtament for a more full and ſatisfactory evidencing of the ſame truth.</p>
               <p>The firſt place we ſhall inſiſt upon for this purpoſe ſhall be that of the Evangeliſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16. <hi>And Jeſus, when he was baptized, went ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way out of the water, and loe the Heavens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending, and lighting on him; and loe a voice from heaven,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Mark</hi> 1.10. it is ſaid, that he ſaw <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Heavens <hi>rent, or cloven, and the Spirit, like a Dove, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him. Luke</hi> alſo mentioneth the opening of the Heavens, and the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>in a bodily ſhape like a Dove upon him,</hi> Chap. 3.21. From theſe paſſages compared together, the Divinity of the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:95016:90"/>Holy Ghoſt, who is ſaid to have come down upon Chriſt, upon his being baptized, may be clearly evinced.</p>
               <p>Firſt the opening, renting, or cleaving of the Heavens, expreſly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in all theſe places, plainly prove the Holy Ghoſt, that is ſaid to have come down upon Chriſt, to be no Creature, no created Angel, but true God. Let the Scriptures be ſearched from firſt to laſt, we ſhall no where find the rending, cleaving, opening, or bowing of the Heavens to be mentioned upon occaſion of any created Angel coming down, but very frequently upon any ſolemn, or more than ordinary appearance, or coming down of God himſelf unto men: <hi>Bow the Heavens, O Lord, and come down,</hi> Pſal. 144.5. 2 Sam. 22.10. (ſaith <hi>David</hi> in his affectionate addreſsment of himſelf by Prayer unto God) <hi>Bow the heavens, and come down, i. e.</hi> Shew ſome Majeſtick and Godlike token or ſign of thy Preſence; ſhew thy ſelf like unto thy ſelf, like a God indeed, in Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring the Affairs of the World between upright and wicked men. In like manner, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> or the Church of God perſonated by him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.1. <hi>O that thou wouldeſt rent the Heavens, and come down.</hi> Doubtleſs, his meaning was not to deſire of God that he would diſplay the Enſign of an Angel before him, and ſo come down to help his Church, and People; no: but (as was ſaid before) that he would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his appropriate and God-like Majeſty. <hi>It came to paſs</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi>) <hi>that the Heavens were opened, and I ſaw Viſions of God,</hi> Ezek. 1.1. The Heavens are never ſaid to open, or be opened, but upon the account of ſome immediate or extraordinary appearance of God: as <hi>Steven</hi> is ſaid to have ſeen the <hi>Heavens opened, and Jeſus ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the right hand of God,</hi> Acts 7.56. As for that of our Saviour in <hi>John, Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, that hereafter you ſhall ſee Heaven open, and the Angels of God aſcending and deſcending upon the Son of man, Joh.</hi> 1.51. Whether we underſtand the place Metaphorically (with ſome) concerning more full and manifeſt diſcoveries of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that ſhould ſhortly be made in the World by a more clear preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel by the Apoſtles; or more literally (with others) of the Day of the general Judgment of the World, when the Angels ſhall accompany him from Heaven, and miniſter unto him during the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Judgment, it no waies contradicts that Principle of truth, on which we build, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Heavens are never ſaid to be opened, rent, or bowed down, but upon ſome extraordinary appearance of God. This is one conſideration from the place cited to evince and prove the Holy Ghoſt, coming down upon Chriſt, to have been truly God; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Heavens are ſaid to have been opened, rent, or cleft, at, or immediately before his coming down.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another thing in the ſame paſſage evidently evincing the ſame Truth, is, that this Spirit of God is ſaid to have deſcended and lighted upon him: <hi>John</hi> adds, that this Spirit <hi>abode upon him, I ſaw</hi> (ſaith
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:95016:90"/>
                  <hi>John</hi>) <hi>the Spirit deſcending from Heaven like a Dove, and it abode on him,</hi> Joh. 1.32, 33. Firſt, if this Spirit were but a meer Creature, a created Angel, he muſt be ſuppoſed to have been locally and eſſentially abſent from, or out of the World, ſome ſpace (at leaſt) before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down upon Chriſt; for <hi>John</hi> ſaith (as we heard) expreſly that he ſaw him, not ſimply deſcending, but deſcending <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, from, or our of Heaven; therefore he was in Heaven ſome while (at leaſt) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before his coming down. If then he were a created Angel, he could not be, at the ſame inſtant of time, in Heaven and in Earth too; and conſequently the World muſt needs Univerſally, and in all, and every the members of it, have been utterly deſtitute of the Holy Ghoſt ſome while before Chriſt was baptized; yea, the Lord Chriſt himſelf muſt be ſuppoſed to have been wholly without the Holy Ghoſt untill now, whereas the Scriptures make it an unqueſtionable Character of an ungodly man, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>not to have the Spirit,</hi> Jude v. 19. So that it clearly follows, that in caſe the Spirit of God, which deſcended on Chriſt upon his baptiſm, was but a meer Creature, or a created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, that there was never a holy and good man in the World for ſome time before; no, nor that the Lord Chriſt himſelf was ſuch; which I know not how any man, that deſireth to be counted a Chriſtian, can own without trembling.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Spirit is not only ſaid to have deſcended, or come down upon Chriſt, but alſo (as we beard from <hi>John</hi>) to have continued, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained on him: Now, no created Angel whatſoever is ſaid, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably can be ſaid to remain upon him. Created Angels are ſaid to miniſter unto him, to ſtand by him, to aſcend, and deſcend upon him, are commanded to worſhip him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but are no where ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to remain in him.</hi> By the way, this expreſſion of the Holy Ghoſt's remaining on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſignifies his uniform, and equitable preſence with him in the fulleſt, or higheſt meaſure, that he was capable of, and that he was not ſubject to ebbing and flowing, to riſing or falling, as he is in the beſt of men; and beſides, it may import, that this Spirit is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable unto any other perſon of mankind but only from, through, or by means of Chriſt. <hi>Sed hoc obiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Were this Spirit of God a finite, or created Angel, in caſe he ſhall reſt or abide upon Chriſt, the reſt of the World, and all mankind beſides muſt needs perpetually want him; For nothing that is finite, or that hath bounds, and limits of eſſence, and being, can be, or abide with one perſon in one place, and yet be preſent with another perſon, though at never ſuch a diſtance form him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Evangeliſts report, that Chriſt ſoon after his Baptiſm <hi>was led of the Spirit to be tempted of the devil in the wilderneſs,</hi> they ſpeak (doubtleſs) of the ſame Spirit which came down from Heaven upon him immediately upon his Baptizing: Now it is marvellous, improbable
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:95016:91"/>(at leaſt) that He, whom all the Angels of God are ſtreightly command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to worſhip, ſhould be acted, and led by one of them into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and this for ſuch an end and purpoſe as to be tempted by the devil. That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is God, is (I ſuppoſe) evident enough from hence, not only that one, or ſome few, but that all the Angels of God, without exception of any, are <hi>commanded to worſhip him,</hi> Heb. 1.6. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, God would not command one Creature to worſhip another; no, not the Inferiour to worſhip the Superiour, much leſs the Superiour to worſhip the Inſeriour, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Luke 4.8. Now then if <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> be the Lord of all the Angels, it is not like that he ſhould be led, or acted, or prevailed with by any of them, one or more, eſpecially into an engagement or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of ſuch a nature as to be tempted of the Devil, to combate with his greateſt and moſt potent Enemy. Maſters are not wont to be led, or acted by their Servants (eſpecially ſuch Maſters who are prudent and wiſe) into undertakings of a difficult nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. (and laſtly) If we look throughout the Scriptures, we ſhall not find any Angel that ever appeared unto men in any other form, likeneſs, or ſhape of any other Creature but only of a man; whereas we read of appearances of God himſelf in the forms of ſeveral other Creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides men. He appears in a cloud of fire <hi>upon mount Sinal,</hi> Exo. 24.16, 17. So again, in a cloud to the <hi>ſeventy Elders,</hi> Num. 11.25. As for the Angel which is ſaid to have appeared unto <hi>Moſes in a flame of fire out of the midſt of the buſh,</hi> Exod. 3.2. and ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 7.30. It is evident from the fourth verſe of that Chapter (<hi>Exod.</hi> 3.) and ſo from <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32. that it was not a created Angel, but he that is elſewhere called the Angel of the Covenant, the Angel of the face and preſence of God, Chriſt himſelf, who is called an Angel very frequently, as <hi>Calvin</hi> and others the beſt and ſoundeſt of Interpreters teach and prove. Evident it is, that the Counſel and intent of God the Father, in ſending down the Holy Ghoſt from heaven in that bodily ſhape we heard upon his Son Jeſus Chriſt, was for the publick, and ſolemn inauguration of him into his Prophetical Office, the Great Office of preaching and publiſhing the Goſpel unto the World. This appears from that voice which was heard from Heaven, which was an Interpreter of the whole Tranſaction, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, hear him.</hi> So then, God the Father, and God the Holy Ghoſt did together inaugurate, ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inveſt <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> into his Great Prophetical Office, wherein from henceforth he was to miniſter unto the World, and immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this inauguration he began to execute it; That which the Father act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the buſineſs, was in that audible voice that came from Heaven. That which the Holy Ghoſt did, was by that viſible appearance, and lighting on him like a Dove: So that the interpoſure, or action of the one and of the other were much alike; the one had little or no prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:95016:91"/>above the other. Now, it being the proper Intereſt of God alone, and not appertaining to the Creature, to raiſe up and ſend Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, one or other: certainly, it was not proper for any Creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever to have a hand in the ſending that Prophet of Prophets, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the World, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                  <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Concerning this place I ſuppoſe theſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is ſpoken of that Baptiſm which is unto Remiſſion of ſins, <hi>i. e.</hi> which was given, and appointed by God to ſecure or ſeal unto men the forgiveneſs of their ſins upon their repentance, whether they have already repented or no.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That He, into whoſe name any perſon is baptized with ſuch a Baptiſm as this, a Baptiſm of this import, muſt be in a capacity of forgiving ſins upon repentance. Theſe two things ſuppoſed, I argue thus: If the Holy Ghoſt be ſuch a Perſon, in whoſe Name, together with the Name of the Father, and of the Son, it is meet for men to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, then is He truly God: But ſuch a perſon He is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This latter Propoſition is unqueſtionable from the words of the Scripture before us; For doubtleſs the Lord Chriſt would not have commanded his Apoſtles to baptize in his Name, were he not a Perſon meet in whoſe NameBaptiſm ſhould be adminiſtred. The other Propoſition cannot reaſonably be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied neither; becauſe He, in whoſe Name it is any waies meet for a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be baptized, for the Remiſſion of ſins upon Repentance, muſt in reaſon be in a full capacity to give ſuch a Remiſſion, and this not Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterially, or declaratively only; (For then <hi>Paul</hi> might lawfully have baptized in his own name, yea, every Miniſter of the Goſpel may bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in their own names, for in this ſenſe they are ſaid to remit, or forgive ſins, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18.) but Originally, and Authoritatively. For (queſtionleſs) it is the appropriate Priviledge or Prerogative of God thus to forgive ſins; it being He againſt whom all ſin is committed, and to whom men become debtors by ſinning. And as there is no reaſon or equity in it, that one man ſhould have power to forgive another man's debt, eſpecially, that the Inferiour ſhould have power to remit that which is due to the Superiour: So is there much leſs reaſon to conceive that any meer Creature whatſoever hath power to forgive another Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture what it oweth unto God. Upon this account it was, that when Chriſt ſaid to the ſick of the Palſie, <hi>Son, thy fins be forgiven thee;</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees, not believing him to be God, were ſtartled at it, and demanded, <hi>Why doth this man ſpeak blaſphemies, who can forgive ſins but God alone?</hi> Mar. 2.7. And the Lord Chriſt, to juſtifie himſelf againſt the horrid imputation of blaſphemy, doth not contradict their ſenſe in making it blaſpemy for any but God to undertake to forgive ſins:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:95016:92"/>Nor yet pleads, that he had a ſpecial Warrant or Commiſſion from God to forgive ſins where he pleaſed: but only vindicates his Godhead, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him that was ſick, with Authority in his own Name, <hi>Ariſe, take up thy bed and walk;</hi> and demanding of thoſe who charged him with blaſphemy, <hi>Whether it is eaſier to ſay to the ſick of the Palſie, Thy ſins are fergiven thee, or to ſay, Ariſe, take up thy bed and walk?</hi> Meaning, that they could not but well enough underſtand and conceive, that he that could ſay the latter with authority and effect, could be no leſs than God, and conſequently might ſay the former without contracting the ſin of blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is altogether irrational to conceive, that He, that charged the Jews, not to plow with an Oxe and an Aſs together, nor to wear a Garment made of Linnen and Wollen, ſhould couple the Name of an infinite and incomprehenſible God and the name of a mear finite Creature together, to make one and the ſame Name in, or into which the Creatures are to be baptized. For it is not here ſaid, Names, but Name, <hi>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which likewiſe implies, that all the three here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, have but one and the ſame Name, <hi>i.e.</hi> one and the ſame power and authority amongſt them.</p>
               <p>A third place from the New Teſtament, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> which clearly evinceth the Holy Ghoſt to be God, is extant, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Jeſus anſwered, verily, verily, I ſay unto you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> The worke of Regeneration is here plainly and in expreſsneſs of words attributed to the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit of God. So <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. we are ſaid to be ſaved by <hi>the waſhing of Regeneration, and by the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6, 11. we are ſaid to be <hi>waſhed, ſanctified, and juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of God.</hi> The parts likewiſe of Regeneration, the ſeveral graces, or holy diſpoſitions, of which the body of Regeneration is made up, is attributed to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>But the fruit of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering,</hi> &amp;c. From the Scripture then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, with the reſt conſorting (as ye have heard) with it, I reaſon thus: If the work of Regeneration be the appropriate work of God; appropriate, I mean, ſo that it cannot be effected by any meer Creature without him; then muſt the Holy Ghoſt, to whom this work is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, needs be God. But ſuch is the work of Regeneration. <hi>Ergo.</hi> This latter Propoſition (I ſuppoſe) will not be denied, becauſe evident it is, both from the Scriptures, and from the conſideration of the nature of the work it ſelf, which we call Regeneration, that it is not, cannot be effected without the interpoſure of the hand and power of God. True it is, God may uſe Creature inſtruments about the raiſing and production of it, as he commonly uſeth men, his Miniſters, and their gifts, together with his Word (I mean his written Word) but yet all
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:95016:92"/>theſe without his interpoſure will not do the deed, will not reach the bleſſed effect of Regeneration. The Scripture is very expreſs and clear in this, <hi>I have planted</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>and Apollo watered, but God gave the increaſe: So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.6, 7. When he ſaith, <hi>that neither is he that planteth nor he that watereth any thing,</hi> he ſpeaks not abſolutely, as if their agency in the buſineſs were ſimply no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (for he had ſaid of himſelf and <hi>Apollo</hi> a little before, that they were <hi>Miniſters by whom they believed</hi>) but he ſpeaks this comparatively, meaning, that that which they did in the work of their converſion to the Faith was nothing in compariſon of that which God did in it. God could have effected it, if he had ſo pleaſed, without them: but all that they did, or were in a capacity of doing, was nothing unleſs his hand had been with them. Elſewhere, thoſe that are regenerate, or born again, are ſaid to be born of God, <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt is born of God: and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that loveth him that begat, loveth him alſo that is begotten of him,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.1. And again, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>Whatſoever is born of God overcometh the World,</hi> &amp;c. (to omit many other places.) So that evident it is from the Scriptures, that Regeneration is a work which is appropriate unto God, and cannot take place without him. The Minor Propoſition then in the Argument laſt propounded is unqueſtionable.</p>
               <p>But to the Major Propoſition it is like it will be replied, that though the work of Regeneration be attributed to the Holy Ghoſt, and withal, cannot be effected but by God himſelf, yet it doth not neceſſarily follow from hence that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be God: becauſe the Holy Ghoſt may have an agency, or efficacie in it, in conjunction with, and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination unto God, as Miniſters of the Goſpel, and the Perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who are regenerated, have.</p>
               <p>To this I reply: If the operation, or efficacy of the Holy Ghoſt, in and about the work of Regeneration, were ſubordinate, or inſtrumental, we could not be ſaid to be begotten or born again, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, (to omit inſtances of this kind without number:) Therefore there is little queſtion but that in the ſame ſenſe, wherein men are ſaid to be born, or born again of God, they are ſaid to be regenerate, or born again of the Spirit. It is true, ſometimes the <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſpoken of as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental, or ſubſervient in the works of believing, mortification, <hi>&amp;c.

                  </gap>, <hi>by, or through the Spirit mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, ye ſhall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But firſt, it is to be conſidered, that that ſubſerviency which in theſe, or the like paſſages, ſeems to be attributed to the Holy Ghoſt, is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him in reference unto men, not unto God; and the reaſon of the attribution is not to imply that He (the Holy Ghoſt) is not the principal or prime cauſe both of our believing, and ſo of our mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but only that with his agency, or interpoſure about theſe works, he never effects them without the conſent and compliance of men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therewith: So that in this reſpect men are ſaid to purifie their hearts in believing the Truth, <hi>through the Spirit:</hi> and ſo to mortifie the deeds of the fleſh, <hi>through the Spirit;</hi> when they fall in, and comport with the preventing motions of the Spirit in order to theſe great and bleſſed works, which may well, and, with clearneſs of apprehenſion, ſtand with the Spirits being the firſt Author of, yea, and the principal Actor in them; only it implies, that He works none of theſe ſpiritual or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things within us irreſiſtibly, or whether we will or no. And therefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Such attributions of ſubſerviency unto men, as theſe, do no waies prove, or ſo much as intimate the Holy Ghoſts not being truly God, but rather aſſert and affirm it; Becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. that it is God, and not an Angel, that <hi>worketh in us to will and to do of his good pleaſure;</hi> and upon this account admoniſheth us to <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling;</hi> which admonition clearly implies theſe two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That that working of God in men to will and to do, doth not make men actually to will, and to do, but that over and beſides that which God doth in this kind, mens own endeavours, to provoke them to comport with God in theſe preventing interpoſures of his, are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and neceſſary: Otherwiſe the Apoſtle need not to have admoniſhed them to work out their Salvation with fear and trembling: nor needs there more to be done by men for their Salvation, but only to will, and to do.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:95016:93"/>2. The ſaid admonition, conſidering the ground, and motive upon which it is given and adminiſtred, clearly implies, that God's prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace vouchſafed unto men, termed by the Apoſtle, <hi>His working in men to will and to do,</hi> is a moſt dreadful engagement upon men to take the opportunity, and advantage thereof, to beſtir themſelves about the great buſineſs of their Salvation. Now he doth not ſimply warn, and charge them to work out their Salvation, but to work it out with fear and trembling, and that becauſe it is God that worketh in them. This clearly implies, that much of this engagement would be taken off; if it ſhould be a Creature only, as ſuppoſe an Angel, and not God himſelf that ſhould work in us to will and to do. Bat</p>
               <p>Before we proceed to a fourth proof from the New Teſtament, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> to prove the Holy Ghoſt to be God, we ſhall anſwer the Objections made againſt the Scriptures already produced, and argued upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>The firſt place inſiſted upon from the New Teſtament was <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16. which mentions the opening, or cleaving of the Heaven, and the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God; from whence we argued ſeveral things. But becauſe ſome of contrary judgment importunely, and vainly boaſt, that this Scripture is for them, and that they deſire no better advantage of ground for their opinion than what this paſſage affords (though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably object, or except againſt any thing that was delivered againſt their opinion from it;) let us here briefly weigh what their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in this kind amounteth unto, or what there is in that plea whereon they build themſelves from any thing found in this Scripture. The ſtrength, which they pretend unto from the place, lieth (it ſeems) in that meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical expreſſion of the Holy Ghoſts deſcending upon Chriſt. Their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or conceit is this, He that removes, and deſcends from one place to another, cannot be God, or the moſt high God. But this is here and elſewhere attributed to the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I reply, Firſt, To the Major, He that removes, or deſcends from place to place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. Simply to the principle of thoſe men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who thus argue, this Propoſition, taken in the moſt literal ſenſe or conſtruction that can be put upon it, is untrue; For they ſay and hold, that even their moſt high God is bounded and limited in his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, contained and comprehended within the Circle of the Heavens, and that he is not Omnipreſent, unleſs (haply) it be in reſpect of his knowledge and power. Though out of their bountiful reſpects towards him they grant him to be Omniſcient, and Omnipotent, yet their libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality will not hold out to grant him an Immenſity, or an Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in reſpect of his Eſſence. So that in making a capacity of removing from one place to another, a demonſtrative Argument of a created Eſſence and Being, they prevaricate with their own grounds and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and fall fowl upon their own Tenets (which is a ſeldom failing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:95016:94"/>Character of men intangled with error.) For if God, the moſt high God (as they love to call him) be bounded in his Eſſence, and his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reſidence be circumſcriptively in the Heavens, what ſhould hinder but that he may remove from place to place, and, as well as Angels, or created Spirits do, aſcend, and deſcend at his pleaſure? Therefore they, that reaſon ſo as we have heard, pull down with the right hand what they build up with the left. But</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the ſaid Propoſition, ſimply conſidered, and in it ſelf, true it is, that he that removes, deſcends, or aſcends from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther [<hi>viz.</hi> literally, properly, and after the manner of Creatures, or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit beings] is not, cannot be God, the moſt high God: But it follows not from hence, that he that is figuratively, and in ſome particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect only ſaid to remove, or <hi>deſcend</hi> from place to place, muſt needs be a Creature, or ſome finite being. For it is well known, and generally acknowledged amongſt Chriſtians and men learned in the Scriptures, that moſt of thoſe things (if not the whole ſum of them) which are ſpoken of God, (I mean, the moſt High God) in the Scriptures are ſpoken figuratively, and with the excluſion of ſuch particularities im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting imperfection, which the ſame things ſpoken of men, or any other Creature, do commonly imply and ſignifie: So that God may in Scripture Language, and (indeed) oft is ſaid to remove from his place, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.9. without any breach made upon the infinity of his Eſſence, or without any repugnancy thereunto. Thus <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.21. He is ſaid to <hi>go down:</hi> So <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.18. to <hi>deſcend or come down; Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. He is ſaid <hi>to return</hi> to his place. Now God may be ſaid to deſcend, or remove from place to place; not becauſe his Eſſence, or ſubſtance of being, changeth his place, or ceaſeth to be where it was before, or beginneth to be where it was not: thus to deſcend argues finiteneſs of being, and limitedneſs of Eſſence, and conſequently imperfection, and ſo is no waies attributeable unto God; but he (I ſay) is ſaid to deſcend when he makes any glorious, or more than ordinary appearance, or diſcovery of himſelf in one kind or other in theſe ſublunary parts, upon, or near unto the earth, or amongſt men; the ordinary place where he gives an interview of his face, glory, and Majeſty unto his Creature, being the Heavens above: Even as a perſon that ordinarily makes his abode in the upper rooms of an houſe, when he deſires to ſhew himſelf to thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and who cannot with conveniency go up to him, deſcends, or goes down to them. And God is ſaid to <hi>return unto his place</hi> (as in the expreſſion cited from <hi>Hoſea</hi>) when having been graciouſly preſent with a Perſon, or People for a time, as either by a more than ordinary protection over them, or by a more than ordinary communication of his Counſels unto them, or the like; when he ſhall now withdraw theſe ſigns of his gracious preſence from them: In ſuch a caſe as this he is ſaid to <hi>return to his place;</hi> becauſe he doth like a Prince, who, in his Progreſs
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:95016:94"/>thorough ſome part of his Dominion, makes his abode in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Town, and whilſt he ſtayeth in it, much enricheth, and graceth it; but upon ſome offenſe given unto him by the Inhabitants, leaves them, and returns to his principal or chief City, where the ſtanding place of his reſidence is. Theſe things (I preſume) are no new or ſtrange things unto the moſt of you: And the truth is, that to frame an Argument againſt the Deity or Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt, from the expreſſions of his deſcent, argues no depth of inſight in the Scriptures, nor great acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs with their Dialect.</p>
               <p>From that which hath been ſaid, a ready Reply may be ſhaped to the other, the Minor Propoſition in the Argument. This Propoſition was, That to deſcend or remove from place to place is in that third of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> aſcribed unto the Holy Ghoſt. The Reply is, That ſuch a deſcent which hath been deſcribed, and avouched as competent unto God, and is frequently aſcribed unto him in the Scriptures, is indeed attributed unto him: But as for any other deſcent, and particularly ſuch as is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate unto the Creature, it neither hath been, nor ever will be proved to be either here, or any where elſe, aſcribed unto him.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſecond place (<hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all Nations, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them,</hi> &amp;c.) and what was argued for the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt from hence, our Adverſaries (it ſeems) know not how to evade the manifeſt conviction hereof, but by denying that, which (I ſuppoſe) all the Chriſtian World beſides themſelves, do, and ever did grant, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Baptizing, which our Saviour enjoyneth his Diſciples to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, together with their Preaching of the Goſpel, is the baptizing with water, ſo much ſpoken of in the New Teftament; what account or reaſon they give of this their denial I underſtand not; but certainly, the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt and moſt demonſtrative reaſon that the judgments and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of men are capable of, had need be given to juſtifie, or bear men out in the denial of that which the whole World (in a manner) of the religious, grave, and learned in the myſteries of Chriſtian Religion do affirm.</p>
               <p>But not to burthen our Adverſaries with the bare Authority of the whole Chriſtian World (this being a burthen of that weight, that it ought to ſhake any man's judgment and conſcience where it lies, and cauſe them to look about;) but waving this (I ſay) at preſent, I would gladly underſtand from them ſome tolerable reaſon (at leaſt) why that baptizing, which is here ſpoken of, ſhould not be that baptizing which the Goſpel deſcribeth to be the Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of ſins: Or what other Baptiſm than that of water for the Remiſſion of fins, can reaſonably be imagined that the Lord Chriſt ſhould enjoyn the Adminiſtration of unto his Diſciples. That Baptiſm, which is with the Holy Ghoſt, and with fire, is appropriate unto Chriſt himſelf, and immediately adminiſtrable by him only, as all the Evangeliſts
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:95016:95"/>teſtifie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.16. <hi>Jeh.</hi> 1.26. Therefore this was not the Baptiſm here preſcribed. As for that which ſome call <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſma Sanguinis,</hi> the Baptiſm of Martyrdom, or Affliction, even that Baptiſm which our Saviour mentions to the Sons of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> Mat. 20.22, 23. <hi>Are ye able to be baptized with the Baptiſm that I am baptized with?</hi> &amp;c. Meaning hereby, could they drink of ſuch a Cup as he was ready to drink of? The Baptiſm here ſpoken of, cannot in any tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſe be conceived to be meant of that Baptiſm which Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles; For certainly, Chriſt did not command them to make <hi>Martyrs</hi> where they came, nor to ſubdue them by bloud; they might teach men (indeed) to ſuffer perſecution, and animate, and inſtruct them that way; but who can reaſonably judge or conceive that ſuch a thing as this ſhould be intended in ſuch a Phraſe as this, <hi>Go and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the very name into which they baptized men maketh it fully to appear, that it was not any ſuch kind of Baptiſm; and therefore if our Adverſaries can invent, or deviſe, or find out in the Scriptures any other Baptiſm than that we ſpeak of, which is likely that the Lord Chriſt ſhould commit to his Diſciples to adminiſter in the World, where they went to teach the Goſpel; then their Exception may have ſome colour or ſhew in it. But in the mean ſeaſon, there being that Baptiſm of water which is every where urged, and impoſed upon perſons upon their believing, and which was adminiſtred to all thoſe that came to deſire it of <hi>John;</hi> and this being the moſt famous Baptiſm, and ſuch a kind of Action which was very proper for the Apoſtles Miniſtry, or at leaſt to proffer the miniſtration of it where they preached the Goſpel; therefore in the eyes of all conſidering men it muſt needs be that Baptiſm which is called the <hi>Baptiſm of Repentance for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Mar. 1.4. And if ſo, then the Holy Ghoſt, in whoſe name this Baptiſm is to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtied, is without all queſtion and diſpute truly God. But</p>
               <p>It ſeems there is another evaſion or ſhift, by which the Adverſary thinks to convey himſelf out of the dint of this Scripture before us, <hi>viz.</hi> That where the Apoſtles are enjoyned to baptize in the name of the Holy Ghoſt, the meaning (ſaith he) is to baptize men into the guidance and ducture of the Holy Ghoſt: Not as if the Holy Ghoſt and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were one. And they ſeem in their own eyes to give much ſtrength to this Evaſion by comparing it with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. where all the Fathers (the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) are ſaid to be <hi>baptized unto Moſes.</hi> It is clear (ſay they) that being <hi>baptized unto</hi> [or into] <hi>Moſes,</hi> here is nothing elſe meant but a being baptized in <hi>Moſes</hi> his conduct and guidance: And ſo (ſay they) to be baptized into the Holy Ghoſt, or in the Holy Ghoſt, doth not ſignifie any thing more, than being baptized into the Holy Ghoſt, ſo as to follow, and give up our ſelves unto the Holy Ghoſt for our Teacher and director.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:95016:95"/>
               <p>For Anſwer hereunto, Firſt, by way of Conceſſion, It is very true, that here is ſomewhat of the Baptiſm here ſpoken of, ſomewhat of that nature, namely, an engagement, and obligement upon the perſons who are thus baptized to give up themſelves unto the guidance of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, by way of Exception; 1. That which is ſomewhat more in this Baptiſm, is, That they be baptized into the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, for the Remiſſion of ſins. Now, this is the intent of the meſſage of Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> That upon their Repentance their ſins are forgiven them; or in caſe they have repented, their ſins ſhall be forgiven: This is the mind and counſel of God in Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>But then in the ſecond place it followeth, That thoſe perſons that have been baptized upon their Repentance, are enjoyned by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to deliver up themſelves into the hands of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. So that you ſee the inſtance of <hi>Moſes</hi> is quite of another nature: For they were not baptized with any ſuch Baptiſm, as to relyeupon <hi>Moſes for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> for <hi>Moſes</hi> was not able to to give it: But that for which they were baptized unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> he was able to do for them. Therefore for any man to argue, that becauſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were baptized unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> in ſuch a Baptiſm; that therefore it follows from hence, That Baptiſm which is for the Remiſſion of ſins was enjoyned to be adminiſtred unto men upon the ſame terms (and no other) is to reaſon at a very low rate of underſtanding. And the truth is, that all that hath been argued from the Scripture in hand is ſo plain, and full to the buſineſs, that there is no riſing up againſt it. But though things be never ſo clear, yet there may be ſhifts and evaſions, and ſuch colours which perſons of light and deſultory judgments are not able to ſee through. We know a ſilly Fly is caught in a Spiders Web, even ſo men of light judgments, and who are unſtable, unballanced, and that are not grounded in the truth, will eaſily be turned aſide by things that have but a very ſlight and ſlender apparence, and will be carried away with every puff of new <hi>Doctrine;</hi> whereas men whoſe Judgments and Conſciences are ſtable, will not eaſily be ſhaken or removed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Premiſes conſidered, we ought greatly to take heed, and to look over and over, again and again, ſuch things as we do receive into our Judgments; eſpecially ſuch things which are contrary to the Church of God, and have been generally diſowned by the generality of ſober and learned men amongſt them. Now, howſoever though their owning of ſome particular truth be no demonſtrative proof of the truth thereof, and therefore cannot bind the Conſcience: Yet notwithſtanding, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall be oppoſed thereunto, men had need have Argument upon Argument, yea, the moſt pregnant and clear grounds that may be, before they give up their Judgments unto it. But this by the way.</p>

                  </gap>, <hi>The Comforter,</hi> or as ſome, the Advocate, here given to the Holy Ghoſt, is no light Argument that he is truly God. By the way to give notice of this once for all in the managing of the Controverſie, or Queſtion in hand; When we uſe the word God, or truly God, we do not mean any Creature whatſoever; not any Angel, or other to whom the Name or Appellation of God may by way of participation, or poſſibly in ſome particular reſpect be found attributed in the Scriptures: but the only true God, and moſt high God, or him that is God by Nature (as the Scripture diſtinguiſheth) We judge it meet to give this <hi>Item</hi> for remembrance, becauſe thoſe that are contrary minded in the buſineſs, affirm, and ſay, that whilſt we ſimply or only prove the Holy Ghoſt to be God, we prove no more than what they grant and ſay with us: For they grant, and ſay alſo, that the Holy Ghoſt is, and may (in a ſenſe) be truly God, but that which they hold, and teach, is, That he is not the moſt high God; therefore that we may not be thought to prevaricate with the cauſe we undertake to plead, and to prove no more than only to accommodate our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, we deſire to give notice, that when we endeavoured hitherto to prove the Holy Ghoſt to be truly God; by his being <hi>truly</hi> God, we meant and intended his being the moſt High God, not imagining that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would have ſtumbled at ſuch an expreſſion, or conceit that there ſhould be any more true Gods than one, and he the <hi>moſt High God.</hi> And we ſuppoſe, and this not upon light grounds, that our proofs, at leaſt ſome of them, held out accordingly, and reached home to ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. And we deſire to be ſo underſtood likewiſe for the future, <hi>viz.</hi> That when we uſe the expreſſion of the true God, we intend none other but the only God by nature, who is ſometimes in Scripture term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt High God. <hi>Sed hoc obiter.</hi> To return to the Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</p>

               <p n="1">1. We do not find this gracious Act, or Work of comforting, any where aſcribed unto Angels, but frequently unto God himſelf, as well
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95016:96"/>as unto men, we ſhall not need to inſtance places for this. It is indeed ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43. that when the Lord Chriſt was in his Agony, <hi>there appeared unto him an Angel,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, comforting him. And though it ſhould be granted, that there is but little, if any difference at all, between com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting and ſtrengthening, and that it is as proper a work for an Angel to comfort as to ſtrengthen; yet it is not improbable, but that the Holy Ghoſt keepeth to the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to comfort, when it ſpeaketh of God, and of his comforting; uſing ſome other word when he ſpeaks of Angels, and of comforts adminiſtred by them.</p>
               <p>If it be replied, that even when God is ſaid to comfort, it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conceive that he doth it immediately by himſelf, but it may be done by Angels miniſterially; and by God only Originally and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer; Though this be granted, yet will it not diſable the Argument in hand, taken from the Scripture before us; becauſe that Office or work of comforting is here in ſpecial manner attributed to the Holy Ghoſt, where he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The Comforter. This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that how many miniſterial, or ſubordinate Comforters ſoever there are, whether Angels or men, yet there is one ſupreme, who doth <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidere, i. e.</hi> overſee, order, and direct the whole negotiation of comforting all the world over: who iſſues forth Commiſſions unto, and furniſheth with abilities, and means for the work, all thoſe that are imployed in a miniſterial way about it. Now, he that is capable of ſuch a high and excellent dignity as this, that is able to ſtand under the weight of ſuch an important affair, which at one and the ſame time is to be expedited, and put in execution in all the four winds of the Heaven, in places without number, and theſe very far diſtant one from another, and to provide that the work ſhould be done regularly, and effectually in all theſe places at once, muſt in reaſon, upon a diligent conſideration of the buſineſs, be judged to be greater than any Creature, to have an arm far more out ſtretched than any Angel in Heaven; therefore cercainly our Saviours: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, The Comforter here ſaid to be the Holy Ghoſt, muſt needs be greater than a finite Angel, and conſequently God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, even the moſt High God.</p>
               <p>Nor is it pertinent, or much to the purpoſe here to pretend, that the buſineſs of temptation, of tempting men and women unto ſin, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, and that very effectually, and with too much ſucceſs all the World over, at one and the ſame time; and yet he that preſideth in chief over the World is but a finite Creature, and is ſtyled in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

               </p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, 1. That there are many tempted and drawn away
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95016:97"/>unto ſin, who are not tempted of the Devil; <hi>Let no man</hi> (ſaith <hi>James</hi>) <hi>ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted by God</hi> [no, let not every man when he is tempted, ſay, I am tempted of the Devil] <hi>For God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man.</hi> Nor doth the Devil tempt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, eſpecially, as oft as he committeth ſin. <hi>But every man</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi> the generality, or far greater part of men] <hi>is tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt and enticed,</hi> Jam. 1.13, 14. And we know the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was tempted and drawn away with his own luſt, and enticed to the greateſt impiety, whilſt yet there was no Tempter; much more may men be tempted and drawn away by their own luſts. So that the tempting of men all the World over at one and the ſame time doth not prove, that therefore the Devil tempteth all the World over at the ſame time. And the Devil himſelf confeſſeth in the Scriptures, <hi>Job.</hi> 1.7. that he <hi>compaſſeth the earth two and fre, and walketh up and down in it.</hi> And elſewhere it is ſaid of him that <hi>he goeth about like a roaring Lion ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8. Therefore the Devil is not preſent all the World over at the ſame time, doing one thing or other either by himſelf, or by inferiour Devils his ſubſervient inſtruments. But now the Holy Ghoſt, whom our Saviour calls <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he muſt of neceſſity be preſent all the World over, where there is any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort adminiſtred; becauſe no inferiour Comforter, whether men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Miniſters of God, or others, whether Angels or men, can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the work with effect, or ſucceſs without the preſence and interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of him that comforteth in chief. <hi>Paul may plant, and Apollo may water, but it is God that giveth the encreaſe: So then neither is he that planteth any thing, nor he that watereth, but God that giveth the encreaſe,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7. Neither man nor Angel is any thing [<hi>i. e.</hi> comparatively, or, able to effect any thing, of any Evangelical import, without the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, or actual preſence, or interpoſure of God:] therefore if the Holy Ghoſt were not God he could not render the Word of God effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual in the hearts of men, as to matter of ſpiritual Conſolation; and that he ſhould be termed <hi>the Comforter,</hi> and not be able to comfort au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively, of and by himſelf, or any otherwiſe than as men commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated, or delegated from God miniſterially to comfort, is moſt irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, and no waies worthy to be believed.</p>
               <p>But ſome, that are otherwiſe minded in the buſineſs in hand, except againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation for tranſlating the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I reply, 1. That to him that is weak, the Graſhopper is a burthen; and he that is afraid of falling, is apt to catch hold of every twig in his way, though it hath little or nothing in it to keep him from falling: For what will be gained to the adverſe cauſe, in caſe the learning, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Tranſlators ſhould be made to bow down at the feet of him

And as thoſe Sorceries and counterfeit Miracles, which <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> wrought, being the ſame in appearance to the true Miracles wrought by <hi>Moſes,</hi> prevailed over <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> to the hardening of their hearts againſt God, and this to their own deſtruction and ruine in the end: So it is much to be feared that by ſuch likeneſſes and Colours by which men do reſiſt the Truth, ſetting fair gloſſes upon foul faces, that this will harden the hearts of men, and entangle, and corrupt their Judgments; and God grant that it be not to their own deſtruction. But we muſt haſten, becauſe the blaſphemy of that error which we now oppoſe, and which moſt preſumptuouſly, daringly, and deſperately, in the face of God, Angels, and men ſtrikes off the Crown of increated glory from the head of the Holy Ghoſt (God bleſſed for ever) hath been heretofore broken to pieces, ſtamped, and ground to powder by the learning, zeal, and faithfulneſs of many famous lights burning and ſhining in the Church of God of old, and by ſome of latter times, and particularly, by a late Treatiſe publiſhed in the Engliſh Tongue, by way of Anſwer to thoſe twelve Arguments levied by him who hath of late revived the ſaid Error. The Treatiſe is gravely, and with ſolidity penned, and worthy the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal of thoſe whoſe feer are taken in the ſnare of that Error; or others remaining in any meaſure diſ-ſatisfied about the Point; Though the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:95016:99"/>truth is, they have as much reaſon to be diſ-ſatisfied about their Chriſtianity it ſelf, and whether Salvation is to be obtained by Jeſus Chriſt, and Faith in his bloud, as to be dis-ſatisfied about the Holy Ghoſt being God.</p>
               <p>We might argue the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt from other particulars obſervable, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> upon ſuch an account from the ſaid paſſages of Scripture lying yet before us: As 1. That Chriſt ſaith of him that he ſhould teach them all things. 2. That he ſhould bring to their remembrance all things that he had ſpake to them. 3. That he <hi>proceedeth from God the Father</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] I ſhall but only glance at them. Firſt, our Saviour undertakes for the Holy Ghoſt, that when he comes he ſhall teach his Diſciples <hi>all truth.</hi> To be able <hi>to</hi> teach <hi>all truth,</hi> is a Royalty too rich to be veſted in any Creature, it is moſt worthy God himſelf, and meet only for him. The (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3.9, 10.) Angels learn many things from the Church, and from the Min ſtry, and Diſpenſation of the Goſpel there. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf profeſſeth of himſelf, and the reſt of his fellow Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. who knew more than all the World beſides of the myſtery of Chriſt, and of God, that they knew but in part; Therefore no Angel was in a capacity to teach them all things, when as they themſelves were in a condition to learn ſome things of them.</p>
               <p>If it be demanded, But how can theſe two ſtand together, 1. That Chriſt ſhould ſay unto the Apoſtles that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould teach them all things, and lead them into the way of all truth; And yet, 2. That <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould ſay notwithſtanding, that they knew but in part: Can he be ſaid to know but in part, who hath been taught all things, or led into the way of all Truth?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. That the all things, which the Holy Ghoſt (according to our Saviours Promiſe here) was to teach the Diſciples, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the buſineſs in hand (which is very frequent in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) and ſo ſuch things as were neceſſary and meet for them to know in order to the performance of their Apoſtolical Office, as well in teaching, as in planting Churches, and ordering the Government here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For it was not for them to know the times and ſeaſons which God had reſerved in his own hand. Nor doth it follow from hence, either that the Holy Ghoſt was not able to teach them, that reſtrained all things, or that the teaching of this reſtrained all things, ſhould be no ſufficient proof of the Holy Ghoſts being God. The former of theſe is evident enough from the common principle in reaſon. God and Nature, as they are not defective in things that be neceſſary, ſo neither do they abound in things that be ſuperfluous. And therefore if the Apoſtles had no need of any further knowledge of any thing which did any waies conduce to the performance of their great Office, as they were Apoſtles, It is not to be conceived that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould impart ſuch things unto
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95016:99"/>them which were not expedient for them to know. The latter, <hi>viz.</hi> That the teaching of that limited all things we ſpeak of (eſpecially) taken with that Clauſe that goeth along with it, <hi>and bring all things to your remembrance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you,</hi> Joh. 14.26. is an Argument no waies defective in proof that the Holy Ghoſt, who was to do all theſe things, is truly God; this (I ſay) is evident from hence.</p>
               <p>For 1. He, that ſhall be able to teach all that was neceſſary for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to know for the diſcharge of their great Office, muſt be ſuppoſed to know all the heights and depths of the Scriptures, all things that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and comprehended there: For doubtleſs, there is nothing in the Word of God but what was fitting and neceſſary for the Apoſtles to know and underſtand: As namely, the ſitting and applying of all the Figures, Shadows, and Ceremonies under the Law to and with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; and ſo likewiſe to know and underſtand all obſcure Propheſies; for otherwiſe they might have been foyled and intangled by their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, which would have been matter of prejudice to them in the fulfilling of their Office. Now then, to be able to do this certainly, doth prove ſufficiently that he muſt needs be God. <hi>For</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1 1. ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) <hi>what man knoweth the things of a man ſave the Spirit of a man which is in him?</hi> It is the Spirit within a man who knoweth all the motions of the heart, all the Purpoſes, Counſels, Hopes, Sorrows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No man knows all theſe things but the ſpirit of a man which is within him, which is intimous to him, and upon the matter himſelf: Even ſo, after the ſame manner we may ſay, no man knows the things of God but the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; <hi>The Spirit God ſearcheth the deep things of God.</hi> As the Spirit of a man is privy to the moſt ſecret things of a man, even ſo the Spirit of God is privy to the ſecrets of God: So there is no man, and conſequently no Spirit beſides, no Creature, no Angel, though never ſo great and near unto God in point of Office and Miniſtry, that is able to ſearch the deep things of God but only the Spirit of God, which is intimately acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the deep things of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that was able to bring so the Apoſtles remembrance whatſoever Chriſt had ſaid unto them muſt neds be God, becauſe he muſt know their hearts, and their thoughts, and what of themſelves they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member without him, and withall to know what was worn or blotted out of their memories. For (I ſuppoſe) the meaning is not, that when the Spirit comes he ſhould be a Remembrancer unto them of ſuch things which they remembred already; and therefore it ſuppoſes that the Holy Ghoſt (of whom it is ſaid he ſhould remember them of all things that Chriſt had formerly ſpoken unto them) did know the ſtate of their minds and inward parts, and that he knew what things they had, or did remember, and what things they had forgotten and loſt, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſhouldſupply them. Which is another conſideration that doth argue that certainly this Spirit of God, this ſamje great Remembrancer of the Apoſtles, can be no other but God.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:95016:100"/>3. We might alſo argue from that other Clauſe where our Saviour deſcribes the Holy Ghoſt, or the Spirit of God, (there being no plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Holy Ghoſts) to be one individual <hi>Spirit of Truth;</hi> And then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes his Proceſs; <hi>which proceeds from,</hi> or out of <hi>the Father.</hi> For both words ſhould be put in, from the Father, and proceeds out of the Father (after an ineffable and inconceivable manner.) Now, if any ſuch Character as this, or any near to it, can be found to be given of any Angel or Spirit; that he proceedeth out, of, or from God the Father; then (haply) this will not prove the Holy Ghoſt to be one and the ſame God with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is the moſt high God.</p>
               <p>For as for that word indeed our Adverſaries do marvellouſly pleaſe and gratifie their weak Diſciples with it; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> falling foul, and uttering evil ſpeeches againſt ſeveral kinds of expreſſions which the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſpeaking of God, as three and one do invite and lead men unto. Now, becauſe theſe things cannot be explained nor made ſutable to the minds of men by any thing found in the Creature that ſhould anſwer them, they fall foul upon them, and ſay that they are nothing but devices, tricks, and ſubtilties of men, which (they ſay) are contrary to Principles of Reaſon and Underſtanding; Whereas the truth is, they are things that are moſt rational, and of an elevating nature unto thoſe who underſtand them whoſe Element they are, who are verſed in the traverſing of ſuch curious queſtions, and myſterious ſpeculations; I ſay, they are moſt rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal unto them, and admit of the moſt curious debates. But that which in the general may ſatisfie the meaneſt capacity concerning the Three in One we may thus conceive. That according to the Nature, Eſſence, or ſimple Being of every thing whatſoever, ſuch likewiſe is the <hi>Modus</hi> or manner of that reſpective Being; For there is nothing that hath a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Being but it hath a <hi>Modus,</hi> or a particular manner of Being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which it is or hath its ſubſiſtence. Now, this <hi>Modus,</hi> or manner of Being, or ſubſiſtence, take it where you will, it alwaies follows the Being, as the ſhadow doth the body or ſubſtance whoſe it is: For Eſſence or Being is one thing, but the manner of its ſubſiſtence this is another. If you cannot ſo well conſent unto this at the firſt view, yet you will find upon a diligent enquiry that the Notion is true, <hi>viz.</hi> That every thing hath a manner of Being as well as a Being it ſelf, and that this <hi>Modus</hi> or manner of Being is ſomething which is diſtinct from the Eſſence or Being it ſelf. Now then look, as things are more excellent in their ſimple Eſſence and Nature, ſo have they a more excellent <hi>Modus,</hi> or manner of Being, than ſuch things whoſe Nature and Eſſence are beneath, and leſs noble and excellent in the order of Creatures. So now, if we ſhall carry up this Rule or Principle unto God, and apply it unto his Eſſence and Being, it will be no manner of offence to any man's Reaſon and Underſtanding that he ſhould not be able to comprehend how, or after what manner the Divine Nature and Eſſence doth ſubſiſt;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95016:100"/>Becauſe his Eſſence is ſo infinitely above, and differing from all created Eſſences or Beings. Otherwiſe we ſhall conceive rudely of God, and pollute his Nature, and bring him down from what he is, and mingle him amongſt finite and limited Creatures, if we ſhall ſeek for any parallel or likeneſs of his Being; And if ſo, then we muſt conceive that the manner of his Being is of the ſame kind, and commenſurable unto his Being it ſelf: A peculiar and appropriate manner of ſubſiſting, which is not to be parallelled in the ſubſiſtence of any finite Being whatſoever. And beſides, we have the help and light of Scriptures to help us in this, namely, to find out what manner of ſubſiſtence this is, that is One in Three: This (I ſay) we have from the Scriptures. And though ſome men do undertake to make it to be nothing but what is very agreeable to the Principles of Reaſon and Underſtanding that is in man, to cnceive that there ſhould be ſuch a ſubſiſtence in the Divine Nature: Yet for this we ſhall not undertake, nor advance ſo high in ſuch a myſtery as this is. Only this is clear, and the foundation is as a Rock under our feet, that there muſt be a peculiar <hi>Modus,</hi> or manner of Tubſiſtence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to the Divine Eſſence or Being, which doth not parallel, nor cannot be matched by the whole Creation. And that it may be thus, as well as any otherwiſe, I think is as clear as the other; For whatſoever you will imagine, or whatſoever your Underſtandings ſhould project unto you to be the peculiar manner of this ſubſiſtence, moſt certain it is that it will be as hard to explain, and bring it down to the capacity, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of men, as the Being it ſelf, which is infinite, or as the ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of Three in One. <label type="milestone">

               <p>I ſhall only add a few more Teſtimonies from the Scriptures wherein the Deity or Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt ſhineth as light at the noon day; and then proceed to ſhew the fallacies, and other weakneſſes of thoſe pretenſes, wherein our Adverſaries rejoyce ſo much as if they were Arguments above Anſwer, and ſo put an end to our preſent debate.</p>
               <p>The firſt Scripture ſhall be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.22. <hi>And when he had ſaid this he breathed on them, and ſaith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe ſoever ſins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and whoſe ſoever ſins ye retain, they are retained.</hi> Firſt, When Chriſt, breathing upon his Diſciples, ſaid unto them, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Is it tolerable to imagine that his meaning ſhould be, Receive ye an Angel, or the ſupreme Angel? That by the Holy Ghoſt here he doth not, cannot mean the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt (ſo called) but the gift of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, appears, 1. From the nature of the Symbol, or outward ſign, which Chriſt uſeth in communicating or giving the Holy Ghoſt unto them, <hi>viz.</hi> That infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or breathing upon them. The Holy Ghoſt himſelf is elſewhere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto the wind, which is a kind of breathing, or moving of the air; and fitly ſo may be, partly, becauſe his manner of proceeding from the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95016:101"/>Father and the Son is by way of ſpiration or breathing [<hi>i.e.</hi> The ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and inexplicable manner of his proceeding amongſt all created things, or things intelligible unto men, is beſt reſembled by, or comes neareſt unto a ſpiration or breathing:] Partly alſo, becauſe as the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal or firſt cauſe, and ſo likewiſe that which becomes of the wind, or that which is done by the wind, is very ſecret unto men: So is the firſt ſpring, or original of the Spirits entring, or coming into men, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the end which the Spirit makes with men, into whom he cometh are great ſecrets, hidden myſteries unto the generality of men; very hard, and diſſicult, and of an abſtruſe definition and demonſtration. This our Saviour (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8.) deſcribes by the nature of the wind. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth, and thou heareſt the ſound thereof, but canſt not tell whence it cometh, nor whither it goeth: So is every one that is born of the Spirit.</hi> It is very likely that God made this ſame material World in ſuch a ſhape as he hath now done, and ſuch and ſuch Creatures, as now are made; And ſo, ſuch Laws for theſe Creatures to act, and move by, and furniſhed, and endued them with ſuch properties and qualities as now he hath done: That ſo there might be fit reſemblances to train and nurture up the Minds, Underſtandings, and Reaſons of men in the knowledge and apprehenſion of the myſteries of Chriſt, and the great things of Eternity. And I make no queſtion but that God in Nature hath contrived, and ordered the matter ſo with that Creature which we call the Wind, that it poſeth and troubles all the Philoſophers, that though they hear the ſound of it, yet not any one of them can give an account of it, what it ſhould be, and whence it ſhould come, and when once it is up in motion, why it ſhould Fall. Nay, God hath ſo ordered the original of the wind, and things appertaining to it (at leaſt, to the Vnderſtandings of men, that they ſhould not be able to give ſo ſteady an account of the riſing and falling of it, as they are to do of the riſing and ſetting of the Sun; that ſo there might be a kind of riſing advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage adminiſtred unto men to conceive the better of the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit of God, and of his Tranſactions and manner in doing matters with the Creatures. So that now we ſee the Holy Ghoſt himſelf is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled with the wind, and very aptly ſo may be; but the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt neither are in Scripture, nor with any commodiouſneſs of reſemblance, can be reſembled by breathing, or by wind; therefore by the Holy Ghoſt (in the place in hand) cannot be meant the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, but the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf. Again, this might be made to appear further, by comparing herewith ſeveral other places of Scripture, by which it is evident that it was the Holy Ghoſt himſelf that was to be given unto the Apoſtles, and to be, and to abide with them, <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17. So <hi>grieve not the Spirit, quench not the Spirit,</hi> Eph. 4.30. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. beſides other places. Now then, if Chriſt ſaid unto them, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> there is no
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95016:101"/>queſtion but they did receive him; they, I mean all thoſe to whom he thusſpake: Now, if he were a created Angel, or meer Creature, how could more than one receive him at once? Eſpecially, how could he be in, and remain with many at the ſame time, when theſe ſhall be diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſcattered up and down the World in Nations, and places far diſtant, as the Apoſtles (we know) ſoon after were? <hi>We</hi> never read nor heard of any more than one Holy Ghoſt (as was obſerved) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Argument in hand cannot be put off with common Evaſions, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt might be in the Apoſtles, though never ſo remote, at one and the ſame time by his Deputies, or Vicegerents (other inferiour Angels under his command, or the like.) For 1. we have no ground in Scripture to conceive any ſuch power given unto one Angel over another as that any one ſhould be at the command, or diſpoſal of his Fellows. Beſides, when Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> if it be ſuppoſed that there is but only one Holy Ghoſt (and certain I am that the Scripture ſuppoſeth no more) and that this Holy Ghoſt could be but only in one of them at the preciſe time of Chriſt's ſo ſpeaking unto them (which muſt likewiſe be ſuppoſed if the Holy Ghoſt be a finite and created Angel) then it undeniably follows, that though Chriſt indifferently ſaid to all his Diſciples, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and indifferently breathed upon them all, yet that he gave him unto one only, and that the reſt had ſome other Angel given unto them, not the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>We might likewiſe reinforce it from the words following, touching the power of remitting, and retaining ſin, conferred at the ſame time upon the Diſciples when they received the Holy Ghoſt; from hence, (I ſay) we might re-aſſert our former Argument for the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>viz.</hi> His power to forgive ſins. For the power of forgiving, and retaining ſins being given unto the Apoſtles upon their receiving of the Holy Ghoſt, plainly ſheweth, that Primarily and Authoritatively it reſideth in the Holy Ghoſt himſelf; and that it was derived unto them only in a Miniſterial way, and as they were to be acted and guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him in the adminiſtration and exerciſe of it. And if the caſe were ſo with the Holy Ghoſt (as our Adverſaries conceit it to be) <hi>viz.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt himſelf ſhould only have a power by way of Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God, and miniſterially to forgive ſins; and that he is, or muſt be regulated and bound up in the exerciſe of this power by his Commiſſion, as well as the Diſciples were by theirs: Then why might not they baptize in their own Names as well as his? Beſides, if the Holy Ghoſt were Commiſſionated by God to forgive ſins, he had no power to give Commiſſion either to the Apoſtles or any other to tranſact the ſame work; it being a general and known Rule, and this very equitable, that he that is Deputed, or Commiſſionated by another, having a lawful Authority ſo to depute, to tranſact any buſineſs, hath no power to depute
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95016:102"/>or ſubſtitute others in his ſtead for the tranſacting the buſineſs commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him.</p>
               <p>Another Scripture, or pair of Scriptures evincing the ſame great Truth with the former, that without controverſie the Holy Ghoſt is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, is <hi>Acts</hi> 1.16. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 4.24. In the former place <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakech thus, <hi>Men and Brethren, this Scripture muſt needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghoſt by the mouth of David ſpake before concerning Judas,</hi> &amp;c. In the latter place the Diſciples expreſs themſelves thus: <hi>And when they heard that, they life up their voice to God with one accord, and ſaid, Lord, thou art God which haſt made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and all that in them is; Who by the mouth of thy Servant David haſt ſaid, Why did the Heathen rage,</hi> &amp;c? He who in the former place is termed the Holy Ghoſt, is ſtyled (in the latter) <hi>Lord and God who made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea,</hi> &amp;c? To ſay, that God may be ſaid to ſpeak by the mouth of <hi>David</hi> becauſe he gave order unto the Holy Ghoſt to move <hi>David</hi> ſo, or ſo to ſpeak, is to oppoſe the direct and clear Letter of the Scripture, with a man's own thoughts, and theſe weak and groundleſs. If it had been ſaid, that God by the mediate, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening motions of the Holy Ghoſt ſpake ſo, or ſo by the mouth of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> it had been ſomewhat colourable for our Adverſaries purpoſe (and indeed no more) or if there were any ſuch expreſſion to be found in all the Scripture, that God ſpake ſo, or ſo, one thing or other to any perſon by the mediation of the Holy Ghoſt, this had been ſomewhat, though leſs than the other: But now, the conſtant tenour of the Scripture ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as to the point in hand) being either that God ſpake, or the Lord ſpake, or elſe that the Holy Ghoſt ſpake ſo, or ſo, but never that God by the Holy Ghoſt ſpake either ſo, or ſo; it is a plain caſe that all theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions are ſynonymous and equivalent, and that he that is in one place called God, in another Lord, is the ſame God, and the ſame Lord with him that in other places is called the Holy Ghoſt. It is indeed ſaid of the Lord Chriſt, in regard that he was man as well as God, that he gave Commandments unto his Apoſtles <hi>by the Holy Ghoſt, Acts</hi> 1.2. to ſhew, that though he ſpake unto them in the Humane Nature, and as a man, yet was directed by the Holy Ghoſt in what he ſaid: But if it ſhould be ſuppoſed that the Holy Ghoſt, by whom he is ſaid to give Commands to his Apoſtles, were a Creature, or a created Angel, it had rathet been a diſparagement than any manner of reverence or advantage unto them in this kind, that they ſhould be given by him; and this according to the Principles of our Adverſaries themſelves, who hold and teach that the Holy Ghoſt is inferiour howſoever unto <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> be he man only, as they, or God and man both, as we ſay. Now, for one that is ſuperiour in Gifts, Wiſdom, and Underſtanding, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be acted, or directed in what he ſpeaketh, by him that is beneath him in theſe abilities, is rather detractive from the weight and worth of what he ſo ſpeaketh, than
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95016:102"/>any waies adding thereunto. Thus we ſee that the Scripture ſeldom hath any occaſion to mention or ſpeak of the Holy Ghoſt, but there is ſomewhat or other near at hand which bewrayeth him to be, that which indeed he is, God bleſſed for ever.</p>

               <p>But the Adverſary, as one while he pleaſeth himſelf with ſignifying his diſpleaſure againſt the Tranſlation; ſo otherwhile he attempts to come off from the ſaid Contexture of Scripture, which frowns ſo terribly upon his opinion by that trivial and common ſhift, <hi>viz.</hi> That men may be ſaid to lye unto God when they lye unto his Meſſengers; and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Principle, becauſe that which is done to an Embaſſadour or Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger redounds to him that ſent him. Therefore that <hi>Ananias</hi> is ſaid to lye unto God, becauſe he lyed unto the Holy Ghoſt, proves no more (ſaith he) but only this, that the Holy Ghoſt is the Meſſenger of God, and ſent by him, not that he is God himſelf. This Fig-leaf alſo might eaſily be rent and torn, but that it hath been done already by the former hand we ſpake of. For though that which is done to a Meſſenger, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, or the like, whether in a way of honour or diſhonour may be ſaid to redound, or (in a general ſenſe and conſideration) to be done to the King or Prince that ſends him; yet the particularity of what is done in this kind to a Meſſenger cannot with truth, in cuſtom of ſpeaking, be ſaid to be done unto any other but himſelf. It is a common ſaying, that what meaſure is meaſured out unto Embaſſadours, it is done unto the Perſon himſelf that is the ſender of them: But now this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the general nature of that which is done; Be it good or evil which is meaſured to an Embaſſadour, it doth (I ſay) redound in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral way unto the King or Prince that ſends him: But as for the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of diſcredit which is done to the Embaſſadour, this cannot in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or in truth be attributed unto the Prince. If the Embaſſadour be killed, it cannot be ſaid that the Prince is killed, only that he had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great affront offered unto him: So if the Embaſſadour had a high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, a Chain of Gold, or the like, it cannot be ſaid that the King had one, only that this was done in honour to the King. Take an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or two from the Scriptures: <hi>Hanun</hi> (we read 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.4.) <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved off the one half of the beards of David's Meſſengers, and cut off their Garments to the middle,</hi> and ſo ſent them away. That which <hi>Hanun</hi> did in this caſe reflected upon <hi>David,</hi> and was an affront put upon him; but the particular things done unto his Meſſengers cannot be truly ſaid to be done unto <hi>David; Hanun</hi> cannot be ſaid to have ſhaved off the one half of <hi>David's</hi> beard, or to have cut off <hi>David's</hi> Garment in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Take one inſtance more, <hi>Paul</hi> ſtyles himſelf (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.4.) and thoſe who preach the Goſpel, the Miniſters of God, and elſewhere (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.) Embaſſadours [meaning of God] for Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> for Chriſt's ſake to procure acceptance for him with men. Now in caſe theſe Miniſters or Embaſſadours of God be evil intreated by men in the World in one kind or other, the evil that is done unto them God accounts as done to himſelf: But however not in reſpect of the ſpecifical or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar nature of the evils done to them, but in the general as being highly affronted. When men killed the Apoſtles (as our Saviour foretold
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95016:103"/>they would) God doth not look upon himſelf as killed by them, but highly injured and deſpiſed. In like manner, in caſe the Holy Ghoſt in <hi>Peter,</hi> or other holy men, were only a Meſſenger ſent from God, and men ſhould <hi>lye</hi> unto him; yet they cannot in this reſpect, with any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable congruity, or truth of ſpeech, be ſaid to <hi>lye unto God;</hi> but only in lying unto his Meſſenger, to have dealt wickedly and unworthily by him. So that what our Adverſary layeth in, by way of anſwer or reply to theſe paſſages of Scripture yet before us, when it comes to be fifted, and narrowly ſearched into, vaniſheth into ſmoke.</p>
               <p>Another Text of Scripture, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> evincing above all contradiction the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt, is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>For there are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: You ſee it is expreſly ſaid, that theſe three, the Father, together with the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, are one. If they be one, then one in Nature, one in Eſſence, one in Subſiſtence, otherwiſe there could not be that unity in any ſenſe. Now this could not be expreſſed in more emphaticalneſs of words, and which better bear ſuch a Notion as this. Here again we have an evaſion, as indeed there is no end of theſe things. Satan is an old Fox, and hath his devices to keep men from the knowledge of all truths, but more eſpecially ſuch which lie any whit remote from the common and ordinary thoughts of men; ſuch that men muſt take a long journey to come at, ſuch are theſe which we are now treating of. Now Satan takes the ſlighteſt occaſion to colour over and bedawb them, knowing that there is not one man among many that will be willing to take the pains, or undergo any hard travel to wipe off the colours that Satan puts on them. And as in long journeys there are many bottoms, and hills, and Wood-ſides, and there you are in danger of Thieves and Robbers: So there are ſome <hi>Doctrines,</hi> ſome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> where you are to expect and hear of this great Deſtroyer of the Souls of men, lying in wait to rob them of their ſpiritual Treaſure, by labouring to confound the World, according to the ſtate of things there, for he well knows the ſtate of it, and how it goes from day to day: But</p>
               <p>Now as to the buſineſs in hand, ſeveral exceptions there are, which being ſearched into vaniſh into nothing but air. As one while the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary pretends that theſe words are wanting in ſome Greek Copies. Now for that, when there was no Printing in the World, and conſequently, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of Books, eſpecially, ſuch great Books as the Scripture, when it was written, and tranſlated, they were but few in compariſon of what they are now; and if there were any Sect, or any great Faction of men: As for inſtance, of the <hi>Arians</hi> (when they ſpread the whole Chriſtian World (in a manner) over like a Deluge:) Now during ſuch a time, the men of this Notion being very many, they very well might, and in all probability they did corrupt and falſifie Copies; and that is the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95016:104"/>ground that you hear ſometimes that one Copy reads it thus, and a ſecond thus, and a third thus, and a fourth different from all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And it is not likely but that there ſhould be ſuch difference and variety of Copies. We know that the Papiſts now have a great deal of the Chriſtian World under their Juriſdiction; and how they are wont, and that of latter times (the fruit is freſh in memory) to take and to throw out what they thought good out of the Notes and Copies of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> wherein we may ſee the very footſteps of the Pope. There are Books extant, which they call <hi>Indices expurgatorii,</hi> which are Indexes or Tables of what Sentences are left out, and what are put in; and theſe are great Books, and there are two or three ſeveral kinds of them. Even ſo it might very well be that men of this Opinion (I mean, the <hi>Arians</hi>) whilſt it ſpread it ſelf, might expunge, and put out ſuch paſſages, and ſuch Texts of Scripture as theſe, which they ſaw did bear ſo hard, and with ſo mighty and ſtrong hand upon their opinion; but this Clauſe is found in one of the ancienteſt of all Writers that we know of, in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who lived about two hundred and forty years after Chriſt. Now then, ſeeing we find that in his writings, which are more ancient than all thoſe Copies where it is wanting, it is (at leaſt) a very probable Argument that it was in the original Copies.</p>
               <p>Again, another Pretext he hath againſt this, <hi>viz.</hi> in that the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>ver.</hi> 8. that theſe three agree in one, meaning only, that they did teſtifie and aſſert the ſame truth: Not that they are one [in Eſſence] but (as I ſaid) that they agree, namely, in their Teſtimony they avouch one and the ſame truth: So now ſaith the Adverſary, the other three which bear record in Heaven are only one in their Teſtimony, joyning together in aſſerting one and the ſame thing; but it doth not follow from hence that theſe three are one and the ſame in Nature and Eſſence: For anſwer to this, we muſt know that the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> doth make a very apparent and expreſs difference in the expreſſing the one and the other: As in the former verſe, where he ſpeaks of three that bear Record in Heaven, He doth not ſay, that theſe three agree in one, but that theſe are one; but when he ſpeaks of the three that bear witneſs on Earth, He doth not ſay that they are one, but that they agree in one. So that (as I ſaid) here is a ſignal and manifeſt difference between the expreſſion of that unity or Oneneſs which is attributed to the three former, and that which is aſcribed unto the three latter. Neither can the former union be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of agreement and conſent only, unleſs he will grant the Holy Ghoſt to be God; becauſe ſpeaking of the joynt Teſtimony of the three together, the Apoſtle calls it the Teſtimony of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>If we receive the witneſs of men, the witneſs of God is greater.</hi> So that the witneſs of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt is the Teſtimony of God, and it is the Teſtimony of three which are one and the ſame God: One in Eſſence and in Nature.</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:95016:104"/>
               <p>And whereas it is ſtill further argued upon this ground, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Saviour (<hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11.) prayes unto his Father <hi>that they</hi> (the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) <hi>may be one, as we are one;</hi> and this doth imply a unity, or oneneſs in conſent and agreement only: but it doth not imply a union or oneneſs in Eſſence; becauſe Chriſt did not pray, that they who believe in him ſhould be one in the ſame Eſſence; Chriſt could not pray that the Apoſtles ſhould be one as they (namely, Chriſt and his Father) were; for it was impoſſible that they that believe in Chriſt ſhould be one in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and in Eſſence, and diſtinct only in Perſon.</p>
               <p>To this the Anſwer is, When Chirſt laid this injunction upon his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, <hi>Be ye therefore perfect even as your Father which is in heaven is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> Mat. 5.48. He did not intend to lay any ſuch command upon them as this, namely, to be infinitely perfect as God is, but that they ſhould advance towards perfection, and that he ſhould be their Pattern; that they ſhould be as perfect for men as he is for God: So when Chriſt would lay a Pattern before his Father, how he would deſire that thoſe who do believe ſhould be intirely one, and moſt abſolutely knit together as pefect in unity as could be imagined; he (I ſay) preſcribes the moſt perfect and abſolute Pattern of Unity. But he doth not imply, as if therefore the Diſciples, or they that believe in him ſhould be one, after the ſame manner that Chriſt and his Father were one; but he prayes that they might be all one; that is, that God would ſo deal with the hearts of Believers, and ſo direct them by his Spirit, and that he would provoke, and ſtir them up, according unto his intereſt, untill they did attain unto, and grow up in the moſt abſolute perfection of union and agreement that poſſibly might be attained unto; that they might be of one heart, and of one ſoul, as it is ſaid of the Chriſtians in the <hi>Acts:</hi> And in this God doth hear the Prayer of Chriſt, and doth perform it as far as his intereſt is concerned in it.</p>
               <p>There is another interpretation that might be given of the place that is far more probable, and better prepared for the underſtandings and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of men by far than that which our Adverſary pretendeth: as namely, that God would make them one as He and his Father is one: that is, that he would bring his Saints to be one in Conſent, to be one in the ſame Truth. But doubtleſs our Saviours Prayer reached further than to a ſimple conſent. In a word, the meaning of the place is by ſome conceived to be this in effect; and it is a very good interpretation, That God the Father would grant unto thoſe who do believe in Chriſt, that they might believe more and more, For as he that believeth more in Chriſt hath a more and greater unity in him than he that believeth leſs; as a thing may cleave cloſer or faſter to a thing, and where the thing cleaves faſter, there is a greater union: juſt ſo the meaning of the place ſeems to theſe to be, That God would prevail with his Saints, and thoſe that believe in Jeſus Chriſt, that they would ſtrive to get further and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95016:105"/>further, cloſer and cloſer, and more and more united to him, that ſo they might be abſolutely one as much as poſſible might be; and withal, that one Saint might fortifie and ſtrengthen another more and more, and that Jeſus Chriſt, who is the ſtem and ſtock to whom all the branches were faſtened, that he might have ſo much the more honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by having his body reduced into one, and ſo to have it more abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly compleat.</p>

So that comparing theſe paſſages together it is evident, 1. That he whom the Angels worſhipped was the Lord of Hoſts, and conſequently, the true, yea, the moſt high God. And 2. That it was the ſame Lord of Hoſts, or the moſt High God who put the words men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned into the mouth of the Prophet, ſaying to him, <hi>Go tell this people,</hi> &amp;c. Now that he, that put the words of this Propheſie into the mouth of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> was the Holy Ghoſt (and conſequently, that the Holy Ghoſt is the Lord of Hoſts, and he that was worſhipped by the Angels) is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as evidence it ſelf can make it; and this by the unqueſtionable Teſtimony of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (Acts 28.25, 26.) <hi>And when they agreed not among themſelves, they departed after that Paul had ſpoken one word, Well ſpake the Holy Ghoſt by Iſaiah the Prophet unto our Fathers, ſaying, Go unto this people, and ſay, Hearing ye ſhall hear and not underſtand, and ſeeing ye ſhall ſee and not perceive. For the heart of this people is waxed
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:95016:105"/>groſs,</hi> &amp;c. What can be more plain than that he who was worſhipped by the <hi>Seraphims,</hi> and is termed the Lord of Hoſts by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> is by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul's</hi> interpretation the Holy Ghoſt? And if he was worſhipped by the Angels, certainly he was no Angel, no created Angel himſelf, but truly God. Neither can our Adverſaries take Sanctuary under the wing of their common Evaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> by pretending that it might be the Lord of Hoſts, or the moſt High God that put the words ſpecified into the mouth of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and yet do it too by an Angel: For 1. here is no ground at all, no touch or breathing of any circumſtance to build ſuch a conceit or pretenſe upon. 2. That which the Lord of Hoſts did unto <hi>Iſaiah</hi> by the Miniſtery of an Angel in his Viſion is expreſly aſcribed to the Angel who did miniſter unto him in this kind, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>Then flew one of the Seraphims unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the Altar; and he laid it upon my mouth, and ſaid, Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy ſin purged:</hi> What God did by an Angel unto <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is (as we hear) expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributed to the Angel that did it. And if it had been an Angel that by order and Commiſſion from God dictated that Propheſie unto <hi>Iſaiah</hi> which here he is commanded to utter unto the People, why ſhould not this have been mentioned, and the act of dictation we ſpeak of aſcribed unto the Angel, as well as that other? Eſpecially conſidering that the Angel, which is pretended to have been miniſterial unto God, in the latter (I mean, in ſuggeſting the words of the Propheſie unto the Prophet) is ſuppoſed to be an Angel of far greater worth and dignity than the other (for ſuch the Holy Ghoſt is ſuppoſed to be by our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſupreme Angel in dignity.) Now it is no waies reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuppoſe that the Act of an inferiour Agent or Inſtrument ſhould be recorded, and the act of a far greater Inſtrument, in and about the ſame buſineſs, ſhould be buried in ſilence. Nay, 3. (And laſtly for this) the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is expreſly ſaid (<hi>ver.</hi> 11.) to have called him <hi>Lord</hi> who had ſaid unto him, <hi>Go tell this people,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Then ſaid I, Lord how long?</hi> If men had though but a competent anoynting with that wiſdom which is from above (as <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17.) and ſo were made <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, eaſie to be perſwaded (indeed poſſible to be perſwaded) by the truth, or to the truth; theſe things might ſatisfie and perſwade them. For what greater proof or argument can there be to evince the Holy Ghoſt to be truly God, or God by Nature (as the Apoſtle diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth) than that he ſhould be worſhipped or adored by the Angels, who very well know to whom worſhip belongeth? Yea, as Chriſt the Son of God is directly prayed unto by <hi>Stephen,</hi> Acts 7.59. <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my Spirit;</hi> and again by <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 22.20. <hi>Even ſo come Lord Jeſus:</hi> So is the Holy Ghoſt by the Church or Spouſe of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Awake thou North wind, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden that the Spices thereof may flow out; q.d.</hi> O Spirit of God breath
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:95016:106"/>upon my heart and ſoul; be thou operative by thy grace and power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, that ſo my Graces, my holy Diſpoſitions and Affections may freely utter themſelves in the World with ſutable actions and deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Some (I know) underſtand this, as if it were rather ſpoken by Chriſt to the Holy Ghoſt in reference to his Church, whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he calleth his <hi>Garden,</hi> than by the Spouſe in reſpect of her ſelf; but the words in the latter end of the verſe ſeem to evince the contrary, for they muſt needs be underſtood as ſpoken by the Spouſe, <hi>Let my Beloved come into his Garden and eat his pleaſant fruits:</hi> Here ſhe ſtyles her ſelf his <hi>Garden,</hi> becauſe of the pleaſure and delight ſhe knew he took in her, and invites him into his <hi>Garden to eat his pleaſant fruits: i. e.</hi> Deſires him to take contentment in her Graces and Services. We heard not long ſince, that the Spirit of God is in the Scriptures reſembled by the wind, and why.</p>
               <p>Yet more plainly than this, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> 
                  <hi>John</hi> prays for mercy and peace for the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> not only from God the Father, and from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, but alſo from the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4. ſignified by the ſeven Spirits before the Throne of the Father for the multiplicity of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributions and gifts given unto men. And here it may be noted, that the Holy Ghoſt is not only joyned together with the Father and the Son by <hi>John,</hi> as with them conſtituting one and the ſame object of Divine Worſhip; but is likewiſe mentioned out of the order wherein they are more uſually named, when all three are mentioned together, <hi>viz.</hi> not in the laſt place, but in the middle, between the Father and the Son; which is (I ſuppoſe) occaſioned from hence, becauſe <hi>John</hi> had more to ſay in the immediate ſequel of the Context concerning Chriſt, and therefore (according to the uſual manner of the Scriptures in like caſe) reſerved the laſt place in the enumeration for him, though his proper place were before.</p>
               <p>If any man ſhall here object, and ſay, That <hi>John</hi> doth not properly, or directly pray (in the paſſage mentioned) to the Holy Ghoſt, no, nor yet to the Father, or the Son, but only wiſheth Grace and Peace unto the ſeven Churches from them joyntly.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, 1. If it be conceived that <hi>John</hi> only wiſheth or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth Grace and Peace unto the Churches; yet it is plain, that he wiſheth them equally and indifferently from the Spirit of God as well as from the Father and the Son; therefore he ſuppoſeth him to be a joynt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with the other two, of theſe Bleſſings. Doubtleſs he would not have wiſhed or deſired them from one that had no power or right of intereſt to confer them; and if the Holy Ghoſt hath power to confer them, what can either God the Father or the Son have more?</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, God the Father may have an original power, and the Holy Ghoſt a derivative or communicated power only: I reply, 1. Here as not the leaſt intimation of any ſuch difference between the power of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:95016:106"/>the one, and of the other (in the ſenſe, at leaſt, of him that objecteth:) For there is a ſenſe (indeed) wherein it may be admitted (without any prejudice to the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt) that he hath only a derived or communicated right or power to give Grace and Peace, and the Father alone the power Original in this kind. As his Perſonality or Subſiſtence in the Divine Nature or Eſſence is communicated unto him by and from the Father, together with the Son; ſo may all Rights and Powers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing hereunto, and founded in ſuch a Subſiſtence, be ſaid to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived and communicated unto him alſo: But as he partakes of, or ſubſiſts in the ſame Divine Eſſence with the Father and the Son; ſo his Right and Power is in every kind the ſame with the Father and the Sons, and as Original as theirs. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Holy Ghoſt hath only a derived and communicated Power (in the Senſe of the Objection) to give Grace and Peace, <hi>i. e.</hi> a power depending on the Will and Pleaſure of God the Father limited by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, Proviſoes, or the like; then <hi>John's</hi> wiſh or deſire of Grace and Peace from him for the Churches was but a Wiſh at Rovers, without ſubſtantial ground or <hi>bottom:</hi> For how ſhould <hi>John</hi> know whether the Holy Ghoſt had it in his Commiſſion, or no, to confer Grace and Peace upon thoſe, on whoſe behalf he wiſhed or deſired it?</p>
               <p n="3">3. (And laſtly for this) It is no waies probable that <hi>John</hi> ſhould ſpread ſuch a ſnare of danger before men, as this; to joyn a Creature with his Creator bleſſed for ever, in ſo great an Intereſt or Power as this, to confer Grace and Peace upon his Fellow Creatures, and ſo miniſter an occaſion unto them to adore and worſhip him as God. And this ſeems yet much more improbable, if we conſider that <hi>John</hi> was guided and directed by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf in drawing up and penning this Paſſage, as well as the reſt of the Book of the <hi>Revelation.</hi> For it can at no hand be imagined (within the limits or bounds of Reaſon) that the Holy Ghoſt, in caſe he were a Creature, and not truly and compleatly God, ſhould be the Author of ſuch repreſentations of himſelf from place to place in the Scriptures (and particularly in the Paſſage now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us) whereby men ſhould be ſo dangerouſly enſnared, and ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally tempted to Idolatry: I mean, to conceive and judge him to be God, and to worſhip him accordingly. The Angels we find in ſundry places (as likewiſe the Apoſtles and Holy men) to have been ſo tender at this Point, ſo jealous of preſerving the Rights and Priviledges of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven entire, that when Divine Honours or Worſhip were tendered unto them, they preſently rejected them; chuſing rather to diſcover their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs unto thoſe that were about to worſhip them, and to profeſs and acknowledge themſelves their Fellow Creatures, than to accept of any thing from them which was above their Line, and of right appertaining to God only. Several Inſtances hereof we might produce, being near at hand: but becauſe I preſume them ſufficiently known unto you already I
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:95016:107"/>ſhall not inſiſt upon them. So that (queſtionleſs) if the Holy Ghoſt were not God, the firſt born of things, it is incredible unto me (and I ſuppoſe will be ſo to any conſidering man) that ſuch things ſhould by his order, motion, and direction be delivered unto the World by the Penmen of the Scriptures, concerning him, which do ſo ſtrongly, and with ſuch effectualneſs of perſwaſion, tempt the hearts and thoughts of men to adore, reverence, and worſhip him as God. That a Reprobate Angel, or Devil, who hath nothing to loſe, nor whereby to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more miſerable or accurſed than he is, ſhould ſeek and project the ruine and deſtruction of men; or out of the pride of his heart ſhould entice men to fall down before him and worſhip him as a God, is no matter of wonder at all: But that the Holy Ghoſt, being (as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries notion him) not only an Elect Angel, but the greateſt and higheſt of all Angels in Dignity, Honour, and Bleſſedneſs; that He ſhould daſh his foot againſt ſuch a ſtone as this, or ſhould caſt ſuch a ſnare of death upon the World, upon the poor and weak Generation of the Children of men, as to turn himſelf into the ſimilitude and likeneſs of the moſt High God himſelf (as he hath done from place to place in the Scriptures:) ſo inviting, tempting, and alluring men to commit ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Fornication with him, to worſhip him as God, is a Notion or Saying, that a man had need to borrow the Faith of ſuch a man who hath abjured all Principles of Reaſon and Underſtanding, yea, and of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe it ſelf, to believe it.</p>
               <p>If it be pleaded and objected on the other hand, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> that if the Holy Ghoſt be indeed and in truth God, the moſt High God; then it will argue that which is more inconſiſtent with his nature, <hi>viz.</hi> That He ſhould make, or (which is the ſame) cauſe to be made, ſuch obſcure, dark, and imperfect repreſentations of himſelf, which tend only to keep the World in ſuſpenſe whether he be God or no; and to miniſter occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of doubtful Diſputations, yea, and of troubleſome and unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Conteſts and hearts amongſt men: and thus ſhall ſeem rather to envy the ſpiritual peace and proſperity of the Souls of men, by hiding ſo great and important a truth from their eyes, than to deſire the promotion or advancement of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there being no expreſs Text or Teſtimony of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which affirmeth him to be God.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, 1. That it is proper to God, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſutable to his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Intereſt, and Deſign, which he drives in the World, <hi>to conceal</hi> a thing (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks:) but it is proper for a Creature, Angel, or Man, to ſearch a thing out, to make a ſecret thing plain and evident. The paſſage of <hi>Solomon</hi> is this. <hi>It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of a King is to ſearch out a matter,</hi> Prov. 25.2. Pſal. 111.2.</p>
               <p>If it be demanded, How, in what caſes or reſpects it is the glory of God to <hi>conceal a thing?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, 1. That concealing of a thing, which is here ſaid to be the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:95016:107"/>
                  <hi>glory of God,</hi> is not meant of ſuch a concealing or hiding of a thing, whereby it becomes abſolutely impoſſible to be diſcovered or found out by men: The concealing of a thing after ſuch a manner, or upon ſuch terms, cannot well be conceived how it ſhould turn to any account of glory unto God. For as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of the dead, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.10. <hi>Shall the dead ariſe and praiſe thee; or wilt thou ſhew wonders to or amongſt the dead?</hi> So we may ſay, that things concealed after ſuch a manner are abſolutely <hi>dead,</hi> and ſo cannot praiſe or glorifie God; therefore that <hi>concealing of a thing,</hi> of which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, is ſuch a concealing which removes it to a certain diſtance out of the way of the common or ordinary thoughts or apprehenſions of men; but yet diſpoſeth of it ſo, or putteth it into ſuch a poſture or condition, that men by ſtadious ſearch, or diligent enquiry may come to diſcover and find it out: as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. ſpeaking of the Writings of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſaith, there were ſome things in them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, hard to be underſtood, but not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, impoſſible to be underſtood: In like manner there are things thus covered, ſcattered here and there up and down the Scriptures. Now ſuch a concealing, or hiding of a thing as this, is ſaid to be the <hi>glory of God,</hi> either becauſe ſuch a veil or covering as this preſerves the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and eſteem of things that are covered.</p>
               <p>Or elſe 2. Becauſe it makes for his glory that the Creature ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and travel for the knowledge of divine myſteries and ſecrets; this argues the exceeding worth of them. But whatſoever the particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be why the concealing of a thing ſhovld be the glory of God; there is little queſtion but, it being his glory, that he practiſeth it, and doth conceal things, and makes only ſome ſparing diſcoverie of them. And this is the condition of very many Myſteries and divine Truths in the Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> to be concealed, and (as it were) removed out of the way of mens ordinary thoughts and apprehenſions: yea, and to be ſo ſituate or diſpoſed of in reſpect of their diſcovery or finding out, that without much application unto God in waies of Righteouſneſs, Love, Humility, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they ſhould not be apprehended or diſcovered by any man. This our Saviour himſelf plainly ſignifieth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any man will do his will</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi> the will of God] <hi>he ſhall know of the Doctrine</hi> (meaning, which he taught) <hi>whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of my ſelf:</hi> Which ſaying clearly ſuppoſeth, that men who are negligent or remiſs in doing the Will of God [in living holily, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and ſoberly] may very poſſibly never come to ſee or underſtand many things contained and held forth in the Doctrine of Chriſt, and of the Scriptures; For it would be a meer impertinency to limit the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch or ſuch a thing to the performance of a certain condition, in caſe the thing thus limited might be obtained without the performance of this condition. So then it is no competent argument againſt the Holy Ghoſts being God to ſay that he is no where plainly and expreſly called
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95016:108"/>God, or affirmed to be God. It is ſufficient to prove him to be God, in that ſuch things are ſpoken of him, and attributed to him, which to a judgment or underſtanding ſpiritually enlightened do by natural and clear conſentience evince him to be God. We are not to appoint or teach the Holy Ghoſt, how, or after what manner, or with what words or Phraſes he ſhall expreſs the things of God, things of a ſpiritual nature: But we are to be content with ſuch expreſſions and diſcoveries of them as himſelf pleaſeth and judgeth meet to vouchſafe unto us; and to embrace for Truth, not only that which lieth in the Superficies and firſt face of the Letter, but alſo that which lieth deep down, yea, and whatſoever is conſequentially comprehended in the Letter. As when God himſelf ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 3.6. <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob;</hi> here is no mention in the words, no jot or title in the Letter of any ſuch thing as the Reſurrection of the dead, yet our Saviour proves the Reſurrection of the dead from theſe words; yea, and blames the <hi>Sadduces</hi> that were ſo perfunctory in reading and peruſing the Scriptures as not to obſerve it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.26. <hi>Have ye not read</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Book of Moſes, how in the buſh God ſpake unto him, ſaying, I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob; ye therefore do greatly err, not knowing the Scriptures:</hi> clearly implying, that however the Reſurrection of the dead was not in the Letter or ſurface of the words; yet it lay deeper, and was within the reach of theſe words, and might have been wrought out of them by conſideration and ſtrength of diſcourſe: And becauſe they (the Sadduces) did not do this, they fell into a moſt dangerous and horrid Error to deny the Reſurrection of the dead, as if there had been no ſuch Doctrine taught in the Scriptures: whereas the Lord Chriſt himſelf clearly and with evidence of deduction findeth it in that one paſſage of God to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That is further conſiderable, in reference to the buſineſs in hand, that the Scriptures were indited and drawn up in that frame of words and Phraſes, in which we now have them, by the Holy Ghoſt himſelf. This is confeſſed by our Adverſaries themſelves: now then, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, it is the leſs probable, that he ſhould broadly and plainly, and as it were in expreſsneſs of terms, any where affirm himſelf to be God, or any otherwiſe inform the World of this great Myſtery or Secret than by ſecret intimations or inſinuations from whence this might be collected, or made out by the Reaſons and Conſciences of men; it is a Rule pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by himſelf unto men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.2. <hi>Let another man praiſe thee, and not thine own mouth: A ſtranger, and not thine own lips.</hi> It may be leſs marvel unto us if we ſee this Law practiſed and ſubmitted unto by the Law-giver himſelf: yea, it may be obſerved (and worth our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation it is) how thoſe Three that are One (as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh) the three Perſons in the Trinity (as Chriſtians have been wont hitherto to expreſs themſelves) are wont to expreſs, and with plainneſs of terms to give
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95016:108"/>honour one unto another (as the Apoſtle exhorteth Chriſtians to do one by another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. and commonly either to wave, or at moſt with ſome kind of obſcurity and remoteneſs of expreſſion to aſſert or inſiſt upon that which is their ſupreme glory reſpectively. Thus we find the Lord Chriſt very frequently, plainly, and without Parable giving Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto the Godhead of the Father, and plainly enough too, unto the Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt; as in ſome paſſages already inſiſted upon, ſo in ſeveral others alſo: But ſpeaking (at leaſt ordinarily) at an under-rate concerning himſelf and his own tranſcendent dignity, vei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this with ſuch words which muſt be narrowly looked into, and dextrouſly interpreted before ſuch a thing can be found in them. We know the common ſtyle which he obſerved, ſpeaking of himſelf, was, that he was the Son of Man, he no where expreſly calleth himſelf the Son of God, but by conſequence only; and ſo theſe words of his are to be underſtood, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Say ye of him whom the Father hath ſanctified and ſent into the World, thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid I am the Son of God?</hi> His meaning is not, that he had at any time in ſo many words ſaid unto them that he was the Son of God; but only that he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſuch things unto them, from which they gathered it (and that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) in a like ſenſe, the charge of the High Prieſt is to be taken likewiſe, or otherwiſe it will be found untrue: For (ſaith he, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.43.) <hi>he ſaid I am the Son of God,</hi> but this was true interpretatively and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructively only (as hath been ſaid:) Yet both the Father and the Holy Ghoſt do expreſly (and as we uſe to ſay) <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> caſt this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour upon him. <hi>This is my beloved Son</hi> (ſaith the Father in a voice from Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 13.33. <hi>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt doth not only in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110. (which we ſhall not need to mention) give this honourable Teſtimony unto him, but in ſeveral places expreſly calleth him ſimply God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Of whom, as concerning the fleſh, Chriſt came, who is over all God bleſſed for ever.</hi> Obſerve theſe words, <hi>as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fleſh:</hi> which words are reſtrictive, plainly intimating, That Chriſt had another Nature than that of the Fleſh, or Humane Nature, and derived it alſo, or had it communicated unto him from another, and not from thoſe from whom his Humane Nature was derived. So again, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Without Controverſie great is the myſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, God was manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Looking for the bleſſed hope, and glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus then the Second Perſon of the Three, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed his own ſupreme honour and dignity, with ſuch kind of words and expreſſions which did only remotely or by conſequence hold forth the ſame, never in plain terms calling himſelf either God, or the Son of God. It is moſt reaſonable to conceive, that the Third Perſon alſo ſhould do likewiſe; eſpecially conſidering, that what Chriſt did and ſpake in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95016:109"/>this kind, he both did and ſpake by the Holy Ghoſt. And therefore it is an Objection without ſtrength againſt the Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt to pretend that he is no where called God in the Scriptures. But yet thirdly (and laſtly) Theſe things which are delivered in the Scriptures by the Holy Ghoſt, inſinuating by way of Argument and Diſcourſe his being God are ſuch, and ſo full of inſinuation this way, that they no waies become a Creature, or him that is not God: For though it well becometh God (as we lately heard) to conceal a thing, and in ſome caſes to make darkneſs his Pavilion round about him (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaketh) I mean, to ſhroud or hide Divine Majeſty in ſuch Expreſſions and Diſpenſations wherein he cannot be diſcovered but by a diligent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the Mind and Underſtanding of men; yet it no waies becometh a Creature to conceal or hide his Creatureſhip, or his being a Creature, under any ſuch veil or covering of words which are far more apt and likely to tempt the thoughts and reaſons of men to think him to be God than a Creature. It is indeed the property of that Creature, who is the firſt-born Son of Perdition the Devil, thus to do all that he is able, both by word and deed, to entice the World into a conſent, or opinion, that he is God; and we know that he hath prevailed upon the far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part of the World with his ſubtile Enchantments in this kind, who to this day worſhip him as God: but that an Angel of light, nay, the firſt born of this bleſſed Generation (for ſuch our Adverſaries ſuppoſe the Holy Ghoſt to be) ſhould lay wait, in Ambuſhments of words and Phraſes, to ſurpriſe and raviſh the hearts and conſciences of men with adulterous perſwaſions of his being God; whereas he is conſcious to himſelf that he is of the ſame houſe and linage of vanity, deſcended from the ſame nothing with them, is at too great a diſtance with all Principles, as well of Reaſon as Religion, for any confidering man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or once imagine: and yet ſuch things are from place to place in the Scriptures attributed unto, and ſpoken of the Holy Ghoſt (and this muſt needs be by his own directions and procurements, he being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of what is there delivered in this kind, as hath been ſaid;) which are abundantly perſwaſive to the Judgments and Conſciences of men to apprehend and conceive him to be God; and this not only the proper ſignification and direct import of the words and paſſages themſelves do ſufficiently prove (as hath in part, and might be further and in more particulars yet argued:) But the experience alſo of all Ages ſince the daies of the Apoſtles, the whole Succeſſion (in a manner) of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, yea, of the moſt Learned, Grave, Pious, and conſiderate amongſt them, having been drawn and perſwaded by the ſaid expreſſions and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of Scripture concerning the Holy Ghoſt, to conceive him to be God, and to worſhip him accordingly.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if we conſider the great jealouſie of God over his Name, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and Glory which the Scriptures frequently ſpeak of, and repreſent
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95016:109"/>as very terrible unto thoſe who ſhall provoke it; it will appear altogether irrational and unlikely that the Holy Ghoſts, in caſe he were a Creature, and not God, ſhould cauſe ſuch things to be ſpoken or thought of him, as the Scripture often ſpeaketh and ſuggeſts unto the minds and thoughts of men. The nature of jealouſie is to be provoked and wrought upon, not only when the perſon or thing beloved is accidentally ſeized upon, and unlawfully enjoyed by another Competitor or Corrival, but when any thing is done that hath a tendency ſuch a way, or which bewrayeth an affection or inclination in a man to injure him in ſuch a kind. An Husband that zealouſly loves his Wife cannot only not brook or bear an Adulterer, but is highly provoked with any immodeſt, light, or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton behaviour in any man towards her: In like manner, the Jealouſie of God over his name and glory is not only incenſed and provoked by an expreſs and right down aſſuming or claiming divine honour by a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but by any carriage or behaviour in a Creature, whether by word or deed, which containeth any ſemblance in it of ſuch a thing, or which is apt or likely to draw divine reſpects unto it ſelf from any other Creature, one or more. <hi>Herod, Acts</hi> 12.22, 23. did not aſſame or claim divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, no, nor yet expreſly own or accept it when it was caſt upon him by the people; only becauſe he did not preſently and out of hand teſtifie his abhorrency of the peoples act in that kind, he was ſmitten by an Angel, and preſently died an ignominious and loathſome kind of death. Now moſt evident and unqueſtionable it is, that the Holy Ghoſt in the Scripture, if he doth not explicitely and directly attribute things proper unto God to himſelf, and ſo claim divine honour; yet he doth very little leſs. He ſpeaketh ſuch things of himſelf once and again, over and over, which according to the ordinary (yea, and ſomewhat more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) apprehenſions of men amount unto as much as the aſſuming of ſuch honour unto him; which (doubtleſs) ſo well knowing the terror of the Jealouſie of God as he doth, he would never do if he were conſcious to himſelf of a Creature Parentage, and did not know himſelf to be God indeed. Thus much for anſwer to this Objection. In the anſwer we have found further Argument and proof both from the Scriptures themſelves, and from clear Principles of Reaſon, that the Holy Ghoſt is God.</p>
               <p>Though for brevities ſake I paſs by ſundry Texts of Scripture which are very pregnant for the Deity or Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. (with others) yet before we paſs on to anſwer thoſe Arguments that our Adverſaries have levied, and truſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for the maintenance of their cauſe, I deſire to trie their Doctrine and Opinion (in the Point in hand) whether it be truth or no by that defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition or deſcription of the Goſpel which the Apoſtle delivereth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3. and elſewhere, calling it <hi>a Doctrine according unto Godlineſs; i.e.</hi> (as heretofore upon occaſion we have interpreted) a Doctrine every way,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95016:110"/>and in all the parts and veins of it, compoſed and framed for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Godlineſs in the World, or for the making of men God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: So that every Doctrine or Opinion, the face whereof is ſet towards Godlineſs, and which hath a tendency in it to promote the intereſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, not contradicting or overthrowing another Doctrine which hath a more expreſs and potent tendency to the ſame end, is undoubtedly a vein or branch of the Goſpel, and conſequently from God; for that is to be conſidered (at this turn) that not every Opinion or Doctrine which hath ſome inferiour and fainter tendency unto Godlineſs is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by evinced to be an Evangelical Truth, in caſe it oppoſeth and riſeth up againſt another Doctrine which is fuller of the ſame Spirit than it: but only then when the Doctrine or Opinion contrary unto it hath either no tendency at all this way (I mean, to further Godlineſs) or elſe only ſuch a tendency in this kind which is weak in compariſon of the other; As for Inſtance, that God will ſave thoſe that will live godlily from the wrath and vengeance which ungodly men ſhall ſuffer by an utter anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation of them, or by putting them into ſuch a condition as if they had never been born, is a Doctrine or Opinion which hath ſome kind or degree of a tendency unto Godlineſs, as is evident, <hi>viz. It is better</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, ſpeaking concerning <hi>Judas</hi>) <hi>that a man ſhould never have been born, than that he ſhould ſuffer the vengeance of Eternal fire:</hi> But becauſe it contradicteth another Doctrine which hath a far more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and efficacious tendency unto Godlineſs than it, <hi>viz.</hi> that Doctrine which encourageth and provoketh unto Godlineſs, not by a promiſe of eſcaping the wrath which is to come by an utter Annihilation, but by the inheritance and enjoyment of eternal bleſſedneſs and glory. That tendency which the former Doctrine hath unto Godlineſs is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Proof that therefore it is a Truth, or any part of the Goſpel. On the other hand, that Doctrine that the Saints may lawfully converſe in civil affairs with the <hi>Fornicators, and Covetous, or Extortioners of this World</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10.) although it hath nothing? of that rich and powerful tendency unto Godlineſs which many other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Goſpel have; yet is that inferiour tendency that it hath this way an Argument that it is an Evangelical truth, becauſe it contradicteth no other Doctrine which hath any ſuperiour tendency unto Godlineſs than it ſelf. Many more inſtances of both kinds might be given if it were needful: any man remembring the Principle or Rule may at leiſure, and with a little conſideration, furniſh himſelf with Inſtances in abundance. So then (to apply the Rule to the caſe in hand) if upon due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſhall appear that that Doctrine which denying the Holy Ghoſt to be God (the moſt High God) affirmeth him to be a Creature, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and contradicteth a Doctrine which is of a more expreſs, preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and potent tendency to the advancement of Godlineſs than it ſelf; certain it is, that it is no member of the Doctrine which is according
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95016:110"/>unto Godlineſs, and conſequently, no truth of the Goſpel; therefore to make this appear, it is to be conſidered firſt, The greater and more honourable the Agent is, that is ſent and imployed by God to negotiate his Affairs with men, about the things of their eternal Peace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his <hi>Agency</hi> or Meſſage is ſo much the more likely to be regarded by, and take place with men themſelves: As on the other hand, the leſs honourable or worthy the Agent is, or is apprehended by men to be, who ſhall be thus imployed, the buſineſs he is to tranſact is ſo much the leſs likely to ſucceed or proſper in his hand. This Principle is delivered unto us in the Scriptures themſelves; in the Parable of the Vineyard; our Saviour preſenteth the Husbandmen, to whom it was let out, as miſuſing the Servants, or the Lord thereof, whileſt he ſent only perſons of this capacity to receive the Fruits of his Vineyard of them; <hi>The Husbandmen took his Servants</hi> (ſaith the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.33.) <hi>and beat one, and killed another, and ſtoned another. Again, he ſent other Servants more</hi> (or rather greater, or more honourable, for ſo the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> oft ſignifieth) <hi>and they</hi> [the Husbandmen] <hi>did unto them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi> Again ſecondly, He preſenteth the Lord of this Vineyard (by whom God himſelf according to all Expoſitors is ſignified) as intending to ſend his own Son unto them, and that upon this account, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe he thought, that though they neglected, and evilly entreated his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, being inferiour perſons (comparatively) yet they would reverence his Son, being a more worthy and honourable perſon; meaning, that they would hearken unto him, and yield to thoſe terms that he ſhould propound to them: From whence it evidently appears, that there is ſo much the greater likelihood, that whatſoever God hath to do with men, or ſeeks to bring them over unto, they will be the more eaſily won or prevailed with, by how much the greater or more excellent his Agent or Miniſter is who ſhall be employed herein. The ſame Principle is aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Therefore we ought to give the more carneſt heed,</hi> &amp;c. The reaſon why there is the leſs hope of eſcaping the ſevere judgment of God by thoſe who ſhould deſpiſe him that ſpeaketh from heaven (as elſewhere he expreſſeth it) the Lord Chriſt in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, than was of their eſcaping who deſpiſed <hi>Moſes</hi> (who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding were moſt ſeverely puniſhed even for deſpiſing him;) the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (I ſay) hereof is this, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is a more honourable Perſon than <hi>Moſes</hi> was; and conſequently, men were more engaged and bound to hearken unto God, and obey him upon His Agency with them than they were in or upon the Agency of the other: this reaſon is intimated in the Text it ſelf, as alſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28. and 12.25. Upon this ground it was that King <hi>Balak</hi> ſent Princes and Nobles unto the falſe Prophet <hi>Balaam,</hi> deſiring him to come up, and to curſe the <hi>Iſraelites, Num.</hi> 22.15. But when God came unto him in a Dream, and charged him not to do it: Upon this <hi>Balak</hi> thought that the repulſe, which he
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95016:111"/>had received from the Prophet, was becauſe the Meſſengers which he had ſent were not either great enough in place of honour and dignity, or otherwiſe not competent in number; therefore he ſendeth more, and theſe more honourable, making account that theſe great perſons next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf would prevail. And upon this account it is, the more holy, innocent, and righteous the Meſſengers and Miniſters of the Goſpel are, who are ſent unto us by God to preach the Goſpel, it is ſo much the more reaſonable that we ſhould hearken unto God in them; and we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and have cauſe accordingly to expect, to meet with ſo much the greater puniſhment from God if we do it not: The reaſon hereof is, becauſe the more holy the Meſſengers which God ſendeth unto us are, and the more they have of himſelf in them, ſo much the nearer they are unto him, and proportionably ſo much the more honourable. Hence it is, that our Saviour inſiſts upon it, as an aggravation of the ſin of the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> that they did not repent and believe under the Miniſtry of <hi>John, when as he came unto them in a way of righteouſneſs, Mat.</hi> 21.32. which alſo he mentioneth as contributing towards the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and believing of the Publicans and Harlots upon his Preaching. Much more might be added from the Scriptures for the confirmation of the Principle and ground you are now upon. But let us work the buſineſs we have in hand by the Rule we have now explained and found ſtraight.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> which Opinion of the two, either that which affirmeth the Holy Ghoſt to be God, truly and eſſentially God; Or that which denieth him to be ſo, and affirmeth him to be a Creature, be of the trueſt and moſt effectual calculation for the advancement of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the World? Examine them as to this Point, and try them by the Rule now ſpecified; and you will eaſily diſcern to which of the two the preheminence in this kind belongeth. It hath been manifeſt unto us by the Scripture that the greater and more honourable Agent God ſhall ſend unto men to perſwade them unto Godlineſs, to tranſact Affairs of any ſuch kind or import with them, eſpecially the greatneſs of this Agent being made known and apprehended by men, he is ſo much the more likely to prevail; Men being naturally more inclined and diſpoſed to mind and conſider what is ſpoken unto them by Perſons of Eminency and greateſt worth, than what is ſpoken by thoſe of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Line. Now then whether he that is really, naturally, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially God be greater in Wiſdom, Worth, and Dignity than a Creature, take it where the glory of Creation ſhineth with the greateſt brightneſs, is (I preſume) no man's queſtion; every man without any heſitancy or debate in himſelf, or doubtfulneſs of diſputation, ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the preheminence of Divine Being, in all manner of perfection of dignity and worth, above the Creature. If it be thus, then it is a clear caſe, that that Opinion or Doctrine which affirmeth the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95016:111"/>(ſent by God the Father abroad into the World unto, and into the hearts and conſciences of men, to negotiate with them about the great buſineſs of Godlineſs) to be truly and ſubſtantially God, equal with God the Father who ſendeth him, is a Doctrine of a far richer, and of a more glorious tendency, hath ten times more ſpirit and life in it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and carry on the cauſe and intereſt of Godlineſs in the World, than the contrary Doctrine hath; (I mean) that which denieth the Holy Ghoſt to be God, and affirmeth him to be a Creature only.</p>
               <p>We might in the ſecond place juſtifie and make good the ſame tenour of the compariſon between the two Doctrines, by another Principle and ground alſo, which upon ſuch an Argument as this might be framed. That Doctrine which rendreth the encouragement, countenance, or reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by God unto thoſe that ſhall live godly, greater and more deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is a Doctrine of a more forceable and effectual tendency towards the promotion of Godlineſs, than that which maketh all theſe leſs, and leſs deſirable: This Propoſition (I ſuppoſe) needeth no further proof, or clearing, being built upon this unqueſtionable Principle, That a great reward promiſed upon the ſame, or like terms of ſecurity, is a greater encouragement, a more effectual motive unto action or work than a leſſer.</p>
               <p>Therefore I go on and aſſume thus: But that Doctrine, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the Holy Ghoſt to be God, rendereth the encouragement, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and reward promiſed by God unto thoſe that ſhall live godly much greater, and more deſirable than that which denieth him to be God; therefore that is the Doctrine that hath the moſt effectual tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for the advancement of Godlineſs. The Reaſon of this latter Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is likewiſe near at hand, and is this, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe God hath promiſed the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, or at leaſt the encreaſe or enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this gift (which is the ſame as to our purpoſe) by way of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and reward unto thoſe that live godlily, or that ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, which we know is the entrance upon, or the beginning of a godly life: This is evident from many places of Scripture, which we ſhall not need upon this account at preſent to inſiſt upon. Now it is (I preſume) no manner of doubt, but as the gift of Jeſus Chriſt, the natural Son of God unto men, was, and is a greater gift, a greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement unto men to believe in him for Juſtification than the gift of a meaner perſon would have been; So likewiſe is the gift of ſuch a Spirit to quicken, enlighten, teach, comfort, and ſupport the hearts and ſouls of men, who is naturally and ſubſtantially God himſelf, a greater gift, a far higher and greater encouragement to perſwade men to believe, and live holily and godlily than the gift of any inferiour or created Spirit would have been: So that it appeareth by the light ſhining in at this window alſo, that the Doctrine maintained by us in the Queſtion yet depending, and which aſſerteth the Holy Ghoſt to be God, is far
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95016:112"/>more ſympathizing with the intereſt of Godlineſs in the World, than the other. To this we might add a third Argument to prove the Opinion, which denieth the Holy Ghoſt to be God, not to be a Doctrine according unto Godlineſs comparable with that which affirmeth it: And that is this. That doctrine which rendereth the threatnings againſt ungodlineſs, lighter, leſs conſiderable, or more eaſie to be born, is not a Doctrine ſo effectual for the advancement of Godlineſs, as that which holdeth forth theſe to be more terrible: but ſo does that Doctrine contended againſt.</p>

               <p>LEt us hear now what our Adverſaries are wont to plead for the ſupporting of their Cauſe; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> we ſhall find their Arguments (ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally) to be empty ſubtilties, built upon a miſtake of the Scriptures, and ignorance of the true nature of God.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To prove that the Holy Ghoſt is not truly God they argue thus: <hi>He that is diſtinguiſhed from God, is not God: but the Holy Ghoſt is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from God, therefore he is not God.</hi> To both theſe Propoſitions in order I reply, firſt to the former, and then to the latter.</p>
               <p>To the Major or former Propoſition I reply, by diſtinguiſhing or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining it; there being a ſenſe, whereof the words are capable, wherein it is to be admitted; and a ſenſe alſo wherein it is to be denied; and ſo it is an ambiguous Propoſition, and of an uncertain ſignification. Therefore when this Propoſition ſaith, <hi>He that is diſtinguiſhed from God, is not God:</hi> If his meaning be this, that he that is diſtinguiſhed [in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Eſſence] from God, is not God, the Propoſition is moſt true; for that which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inite cannot be infinite; that which is Created, and partaketh not of the increated Nature and Eſſence of God, cannot be God: But in this ſenſe of the word, <hi>diſtinguiſhed from God,</hi> the Minor
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95016:112"/>is falſe; for the Holy Spirit is not thus diſtinguiſhed from God (<hi>viz.</hi> in Eſſence and Nature) as we have formerly proved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The ſaid Propoſition, <hi>that which is diſtinguiſhed from God, is not God,</hi> may be underſtood in this ſenſe, That that Perſon who is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from another perſon, who is truly and really God, is not God: but in this ſenſe it is falſe, and neither is, nor can be proved by the Propoſers of it. For ſuch a perſon who is diſtinguiſhed from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon who is God, may be God likewiſe; yea, the ſame God with him, though not the ſame perſon: Otherwiſe it would follow, that becauſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is often diſtinguiſhed in the Scriptures from the perſon of God the Father, as when he is called <hi>the Son of God;</hi> and ſo when it is ſaid <hi>that God ſent him</hi> (with the like) and alſo where he is called Jeſus, it would follow (I ſay) that he ſhould be truly God no more than the Spirit or Holy Ghoſt; for theſe, and many ſuch like expreſſions in the Scriptures import a manifeſt diſtinction between him and God the Father: Nor doth it therefore prove, that becauſe the Son is diſtinct from the Father, that he is not God; yea, as the Scripture fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſtinguiſheth between God, and the Father; therefore if the Propoſition before us were true, in the latter ſenſe it would follow that neither ſhould the Father be God; becauſe (as I ſay) the Scriptures di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh him from God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6. <hi>God even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> You have the ſame expreſſion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3.

                  </gap> upon that diſtinction which is made between the Eſſence and Perſon of God; terming it <hi>a wretched diſtinction,</hi> and an <hi>ignorant refuge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What he meaneth by <hi>a wretched diſtinction</hi> I do not well know or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; if he therefore termeth it <hi>wretched</hi> becauſe it is poor and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of means or friends to ſupport it, he had ſmall reaſon ſo to defame it: For certain it is, that it hath both means and Friends in abundance to ſupport it; it hath the whole glory (in a manner) of all the chief and choice Gifts, Parts, Wiſdom, Learning that hath been found in the Chriſtian World from the daies of the Apoſtles untill now to ſtand by it and maintain it, which have miniſtred Arguments and Proofs very bountifully unto it for its defenſe, therefore in this ſenſe it is not, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>wretched;</hi> upon the ſame account he had ſmall reaſon to call it an <hi>ignorant refuge:</hi> That which had all the Wiſdom, Knowledge, and Learning (well nigh) of all the Chriſtian World to erect and build it, cannot reaſonably be ſuſpected for <hi>an ignorant refuge.</hi> If he calleth it a <hi>wretched diſtinction,</hi> becauſe it is the object of his hatred; and he meant ſo to handle it, ſo to bruiſe, batter, and deface it, by bending the force of his Wit and Learning againſt it, that hereby it ſhould become deſolate
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95016:113"/>and miſerable, his ſpirit of Propheſie hath failed him at this point: For the diſtinction is at this day notwithſtanding all the contempt he hath poured upon it, all that he hath done to misfigure it, it is in as much honour and eſteem with ſober, learned, and underſtanding men as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yea, his <hi>ignorant</hi> Zeal to diſhonour and diſparage it hath provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the learned zeal of many to maintain it, yea, and to add more beauty and ſtrength unto it. But leaving his ſwelling words of vanity againſt this diſtinction, let us hear and conſider what his more ſober and expreſs Arguments or Reaſons are againſt it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſaith, <hi>That it is unheard of in Scriptures, and ſo to be rejected, it being preſumption to affirm any thing of the unſearchable Nature of God which he hath not firſt affirmed of himſelf in the Scriptures:</hi> (theſe are his own words.) By the way, before we come to reply to this Reaſon it is not unworthy obſervation, how directly he treadeth in the ſteps of thoſe who have a mind to oppoſe that which they fear they cannot ſolid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſubſtantially confute or overthrow. For, whereas thoſe men, whom he would be thought to oppoſe in his Doctrine againſt the Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt, are wont to diſtinguiſh between God taken Perſonally, and Eſſentially; he repreſents them as if they diſtinguiſhed between the Eſſence and Perſon of God, which diſtinction is of a much differing import from the former. I do not remember any learned man that ever aſſerted a diſtinction (a real diſtinction of which our Adverſaries ſeem to ſpeak) between the Eſſence of God and the Perſon of God; as if the Eſſence or Nature of God were one thing, and the Perſon of God, or any Perſon in the Godhead, another thing, differing really from it; yet the diſtinction of God, taken Eſſentially and Perſonally, is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent amongſt thoſe who write about the Trinity. How the word God may be taken ſometimes Eſſentially, and otherwhile Perſonally, without ſuppoſing any real difference between the Eſſence of God, and a Perſon in the Godhead, may be ſhewed in due time, or however may appear by what God ſhall enable us to ſpeak upon the ſubject matter in hand. But to the Reaſon or Argument propounded againſt the diſtinction of God taken <hi>Perſonally and Eſſentially, (viz.)</hi> it is <hi>unheard of in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> I reply firſt, that if he meaneth that theſe words <hi>Perſonally and Eſſentially</hi> are not literally or formally found in the Scriptures, in this ſenſe the truth of his Argument is granted: But the pertinency and ſtrength of it in point of proof of that which he infers from it, <hi>viz.</hi> that therefore it is to be rejected, is denied. For it doth not follow, that every diſtinction, the terms whereof are not, in expreſsneſs of words, of the ſame oneneſs of the Letter, to be found in the Scripture, is therefore to be rejected; for when the Notion or Subſtance of what is delivered in the Scriptures, either in a plurality or greater number of words, or elſe in words whoſe ſignification is more obſcure or dark unto the generality of men, or elſe in ſome Principle or Aſſertion which vertually contains
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95016:113"/>and comprehends it; When this (I ſay) is put into one, or fewer terms, or into words of a more ready and eaſier ſignification, or is drawn out by clearneſs of deduction from ſuch words or ſayings which vertually contain it, it is not therefore to be rejected becauſe it is not word for word found in the Scripture. For if the mind of God, which hath been more immediately delivered by him in ſuch words which the Holy Ghoſt (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh) taught the Apoſtles, and other Penmen of the Scriptures, ſhall be expreſſed and conveyed to the minds of men in other words than thoſe (and taught them it may be too by the Holy Ghoſt as well as they) it is not therefore to be rejected, becauſe it is not thus conveyed in thoſe very Terms or Phraſes wherein it came immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from God. For if ſuch a thing ſhould be, there would be no place left for interpreting, opening, or expounding the Scriptures, but only for reading of them; and this without conceiving or forming any ſenſe or meaning of them in one kind or other in the mind either of him that readeth them, or of him that heareth them read: for a man cannot lightly form the ſenſe of any Phraſe or paſſage of Scripture in his mind and underſtanding but by the opportunity and advantage of ſome other words (though only inwardly ſpoken) which are more familiar and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter known to him. And certain it is, that the Holy Ghoſt did not only reveal the ſubſtance and ſubject matter of the Scriptures unto thoſe whom he made choice of for his Penmen; but alſo bound them up in ſuch particular words and phraſes as thoſe wherein they are now written, that ſo there might be the greater neceſſity of the work and ſervice of ſuch Perſons whom God ſhould anoynt with the gifts of interpretation, and ſtir up accordingly to the work from time to time. For it is no waies to be believed but that had God only given inſtruction unto the Penmen of the Scriptures to deliver the ſubſtance, and matter, and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of what they have now delivered, if he had left them at liberty to have put it into their own terms (I ſay) there is little queſtion to be made, but that they would have contrived and put it into ſuch terms that they ſhould have ſhut out, and left no place nor opportunity for thoſe gifts of interpretation, and of that ſervice and employment which God hath now opened a door effectually unto, and hath layed a neceſſity upon men to ſeek after: in which kind of employment the God of Heaven hath a great ſtock of glory going, and great concernments amongſt men for the promoting of Godlineſs and growing in Grace (I ſay) all this would have been cut off, and the neceſſity of it, if the Scripture had been drawn up, or put into ſuch words and terms, as men poſſibly may think had been better to have been done. So that now, as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 8.31.) demanded, when <hi>Philip</hi> asked him this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether he underſtood what he read in the Scriptures? <hi>How</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>can I underſtand unleſs ſome man guide me?</hi> (meaning who is able to interpret the Scriptures:) in like manner may the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:95016:114"/>generality and far greater part of men and women ſay, How ſhall we underſtand the Scriptures aright, unleſs, ſome ſuch Interpreter as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh of, one of a thouſand ſhall guide us? But not to inſiſt upon this at preſent, evident it is from that little which hath been ſaid, that the diſtinction of God, taken Eſſentially and Perſonally, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be rejected, becauſe the words or terms of it are not heard in the Scriptures, in caſe the notion, ſenſe, and ſubſtance of them be to be found there.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> therefore we reply, That though it be no where in ſo many letters or words ſaid in Scripture, that God, or the word God is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken Eſſentially, ſometimes Perſonally; yet that it muſt or ought to be taken ſometimes in the ſenſe meant by the one word, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again in the ſenſe meant by the other word, may be clearly evinced from the Scripture; at leaſt if that be acknowledged and owned as evinced and proved by the Scriptures, which is requiſite to make the Scriptures ſpeak ſenſe, and with congruity to the apprehenſions and underſtandings of men: and I know not what can be reaſonably thought to be more ſubſtantially proved from the Scriptures than ſuch a thing. Now that the word God muſt of neceſſity, to make the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures ſpeak ſence, be taken ſometimes Eſſentially, and ſometimes Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, is evident from the conſideration and comparing of ſuch Texts and places wherein ſuch a conſtruction or acceptation of the words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be avoided; Conſider we theſe two Verſes together, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8, 9. which is quoted from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. <hi>But unto the Son he ſaith,</hi> (Ver. 8.) <hi>Thy Throne O God is for ever and ever: A Scepter of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is the Scepter of thy Kingdom; thou haſt loved righteouſneſs, and hated iniquity, therefore God, even thy God hath anointed thee,</hi> &amp;c. This Clauſe therefore, <hi>God, even thy God hath anointed thee,</hi> is rendred both by <hi>Beza</hi> in the place cited in the New Teſtament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. And ſo by <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> out of the original Hebrew in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.6. <hi>Therefore O God, thy God hath anointed,</hi> &amp;c. In the former verſe, in that Clauſe, <hi>Thy throne O God is for ever and ever;</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the former place of the clauſe mentioned in the latter verſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tranſlation ſpecified, <hi>Therfore O God, thy God hath,</hi> &amp;c. the word God is to be underſtood perſonally, and that of Chriſt the Second Perſon ſubſiſting in the Godhead or divine Eſſence, as in the latter place of this Clauſe, <hi>Therefore O God, thy God hath anointed thee,</hi> it is to be underſtood perſonally of the Father or Firſt Perſon. Now if Chriſt the Son be God, and the Father be God (both which are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough aſſerted in the paſſages mentioned) and yet notwithſtanding be not two Gods, but one and the ſame (our Adverſaries themſelves not granting a plurality of Gods) then it undeniably followeth, that the word God when it is attributed unto them both thus, the Father and the Son are God, or are the ſame God; evident (I ſay) it is, that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95016:114"/>that word God in ſuch Propoſitions or Sayings as theſe muſt of neceſſity be taken Eſſentially, not Perſonally, becauſe it is manifeſtly untrue to ſay, that the Father and the Son are one and the ſame Perſon, and as manifeſtly true too it is, that they are one and the ſame God (there being no more Gods than One. So that the word God in ſuch Sayings as theſe cannot be taken Perſonally, but of neceſſity muſt be taken Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, <hi>viz.</hi> as ſignifying the Divine Nature or Eſſence, wherin both Perſons, Father and Son, do partake; ſo that the ſenſe and meaning of this Propoſition is, That the Father and the Son do ſubſiſt, or are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the ſame Divine Nature and Eſſence, which Divine Nature or Eſſence is ſometimes expreſſed by the word <hi>God.</hi> So again, when God is ſaid to be a <hi>Spirit,</hi> as <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. it is not to be taken Perſonally, as if the meaning were, either that the Father, or the Son, or the Spirit were a <hi>Spirit;</hi> for though it be true of every of them that they are Spirits, the Father is a Spirit, and ſo the Son is a Spirit; yet that our Saviour ſhould here affirm it determinately or particularly of any one of them more than other, no ſufficient Reaſon can be given; Therefore the meaning of our Saviour ſaying, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> muſt needs be this, That the Divine Nature and Eſſence, which is communicated to the Three Perſons, or wherein the Three Perſons ſubſiſt, and ſo are Eſſentially one and the ſame God, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Nature and Divine Eſſence is ſpiritual, immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and inviſible. And yet more plainly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.27. where God is termed only wiſe, <hi>To God only wiſe be Glory.</hi> The word God is to be taken Eſſentially, becauſe, if it ſhould be here taken Perſonally, <hi>viz.</hi> for God the Father (which our Adverſary conceiveth and contendeth for with might and main; affirming, That to take God otherwiſe than Perſonally, is to take him otherwiſe than he is, and to miſtake him, and that there is no ſuch acceptation of the word God in the Scriptures, with the like.) But (I ſay) that in the place now before us, <hi>To God only wiſe be Glory,</hi> the word God muſt needs be taken eſſentially, and not Perſonally, is evident from hence; becauſe otherwiſe the Apoſtle muſt ſuppoſe, that neither Chriſt nor the Holy Ghoſt had any wiſdom in them, or none conſiderable but God the Father only: which how near or far off it is from Blaſphemy, I leave to ſober men to determine. Other places there are without number, wherein the word God muſt needs be taken Eſſentially; But theſe few produced and inſiſted on, are ſufficient for the proof thereof. Therefore the diſtinction of God taken Perſonally, and Eſſentially, is not a diſtinction unheard of in Scriptures, as our Adverſarie groundleſly affirmeth, unleſs (as we noted before) by being unheard of, he meaneth, in reſpect of the ſound of words, not in reſpect of the truth and ſubſtance of the matter; neither do they who ſpeak of God according to the ſenſe and import of that diſtinction, <hi>Affirm any thing of the unſearchable Nature of God which he hath not firſt affirmed of himſelf in the Scriptures,</hi> and ſo are free from all the guilt of <hi>preſumption</hi> upon ſuch an account.</p>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:95016:115"/>
               <p>But the Adverſary cannot be perſwaded himſelf, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> nor be willing that others ſhould be perſwaded, that the Scriptures ſhould own or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance any ſuch diſtinction as that of God taken Perſonally, and Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; and therefore trieth his skill to make us believe that it is diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon, and accordingly levieth three Arguments or Reaſons againſt it: We ſhall propound them in their order as himſelf hath drawn them up, and give replies unto them one by one.</p>
               <p>Firſt, (ſaith he) <hi>It is impoſſible for any man, if he would but endeavour to conceive the thing, and not to delude himſelf and others with empty terms and words without underſtanding to diſtinguiſh the Perſon from the Eſſence of God, and not to frame two Beings, or things in his mind, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently two Gods.</hi> This is his firſt Reaſon, to which we reply three things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas to perſwade others into his own Judgment, or opinion, he would put them upon <hi>endeavouring to conceive the thing</hi> [diſtinctly to mould, frame, and faſhion in their minds or imaginations the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how a Divine Perſon ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Eſſence;] Doth he not put men upon a direct courſe to make ſhipwrack of their Chriſtianity, and all they believe touching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and Chriſt Jeſus? For whereas there are many things plainly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and partly clearly ſuppoſed of the main Pillars of that Religion and Worſhip of God which the Goſpel commendeth unto the World, the <hi>mode</hi> or diſtinct manner. whereof cannot be conceived or underſtood by men; if ſo be men ſhall reject or deny them upon this account (I mean) becauſe they cannot diſtinctly conceive, or ſatisfie their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations how they ſhould be, they muſt together with the rejection of theſe reject all that which is built or hangs upon them; which is (as hath been ſaid) the main Fabrick or body of Chriſtianity. As to give an inſtance: Becauſe it is once and again plainly affirmed in the Goſpel, that a Virgin conceived and brought forth a Child; and upon this Conception and Child thus brought forth we know that the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and frame of the Goſpel dependeth; Yet who is able to conceive in his mind the diſtinct manner how ſhe ſhould or did Conceive; or what the Holy Ghoſt particularly acted or did in order to enable, or make her to Conceive; or what ſhe her ſelf likewiſe did towards or about this Conception? For to Conceive as well as bring forth is a Verb Active, and importeth the doing of ſomewhat either <hi>per modum naturae,</hi> or <hi>per modum voluntatis,</hi> or both by her who is ſaid to Conceive. But that the whole Tranſaction between the Holy Ghoſt and the Virgin, about the Conception of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God bleſſed for ever, was myſterious and ſecret, and the manner of it, in reſpect of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, purpoſely veiled by God, is plainly enough intimated by the words or Phraſes wherein the Holy Ghoſt himſelf expreſſeth the ſaid buſineſs by the mouth of the Angel, who firſt brought tidings from Heaven unto
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95016:115"/>the Virgin of this high Favour intended by God towards her. <hi>The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt</hi> (ſaith the Angel unto her) <hi>ſhall come upon thee,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and the</hi> vertue or <hi>power of the moſt High ſhall overſhadow thee, Luk.</hi> 1.35. <hi>Shall overſhadow thee, i. e.</hi> ſhall ſecretly, and after a manner unknown, not fit to be revealed unto men, negotiate this great buſineſs with thee. Now, if a man ſhould reaſon ſo, or ſpeak thus unto us (about the Virgins Conception;) <hi>It is impoſſible for any man, if he would but endeavour to conceive the things, and not delude both himſelf and others with empty terms and words without underſtanding,</hi> to underſtand or comprehend how a Virgin ſhould Conceive; Should he not attempt to perſwade us out of the belief of the Goſpel, and to abandon our Chriſtianity, only upon this account, becauſe it requireth us to believe ſuch a thing which we cannot conceive how it was or ſhould be? And what doth he leſs, that argueth after the ſame manner to draw us from believing that a divine Perſon and the divine Eſſence can be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, becauſe we cannot conceive the particular manner how they are, or may be diſtinguiſhed?</p>
               <p>Take another Inſtance of a thing oft ſuppoſed in the Scriptures, and which is, though in another kind, very Fundamental too to Chriſtian Religion, at leaſt to our embracing and profeſſing of it. The reaſonable ſoul of a man is united unto the body, and ſo the body is united like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unto the Soul, ſo as to make one and the ſame man or perſon: This the Scripture ſuppoſeth in twenty places and ten, we ſhall not need to cite any for the proof of it; But who is there that is able diſtinctly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or ſhape in his mind, how, or after what manner, by what Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament or bonds the Soul is united and knit unto the Body, and the Body to it: Or how, or by what vertue or property, inherent in the Soul, it ſhould enliven, ſtrengthen, or give motion unto the Body? To omit many particulars more relating to the ſtate and condition of the Soul and Body in their union. The things themſelves being certain, though the diſtinct manner of them, or of their being be inſcrutable unto men, will a man charge him <hi>with deluding himſelf and others, with empty terms, and words without underſtanding,</hi> who himſelf believeth, and would have others believe alſo, that the reaſonable ſoul in natural union, or conjunction with an humane body, maketh one and the ſame intire man or perſon of man, only becauſe he cannot diſtinctly conceive the manner how ſuch a thing ſhould be? Will a man go about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf that he is not a man? Surely no, all the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> in the World, and all the Learned men, who have called up all their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Principles to enquire about it, were never able to reach the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how ſuch a thing ſhould be. <hi>We know not</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> informeth us, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.5.) <hi>what is the way of the Spirit, or how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with Child:</hi> Shall we therefore deny that there is any ſuch thing as the growing of a Child in the womb of her that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95016:116"/>bears it, becauſe no man knoweth how they do grow? It is not a more common than true ſaying, That many effects are viſible, and certain, the reaſon or cauſes whereof are hid from men: as the flowing and ebbing of the Sea (that is a famous inſtance) and the ſaltneſs of the water; the Spots in the Moon; the pointing of the Loadſtone towards the North, with many the like in Nature. And if the Reaſons and Cauſes of things be ſo hard to be come at, ſo inacceſſible to the Capacities and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of men, How much more are the <hi>modes,</hi> the reſpective manner of the beings and ſubſiſtings of things; theſe being many degrees more ſubtil and farther remote from the Underſtandings of men than the Cauſes and Reaſons of the other? And if the <hi>modi,</hi> the intrinſical manner (as the Schoolmen term them) of created beings and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting be ſo difficult to be conceived and underſtood; it needeth not ſeem ſtrange to us, that the manner of the infinite and increated being (which we call God) and of his ſubſiſting ſhould be ſo far above our Apprehenſions and capacities. So that to put men upon endeavouring to conceive in their minds the particular manner how every thing ſhould be, or may be, which the Scriptures only affirm to be; and in caſe they cannot thus conceive of them; to perſwade them to deny their beings; is (in effect) to perſwade and bear them in hand, that if they cannot he wiſe above that which is written, they had as good throw up or caſt aſide that wich is written as vanity and untruth. Moſt true it is, that we ought not to believe any thing in matters of Religion, but what we have a ſufficient and ſubſtantial ground in Reaſon why we ſhould believe it: <hi>i. e.</hi> unleſs we have the Word of God for it, which is the moſt ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ground in Reaſon of all others why a thing ſhould be believed. But the Word of God revealeth many things ſimply to be, the diſtinct manner of the being whereof it doth not reveal: in which reſpect we ſtand bound to believe the truth and being of many things, the manner of whoſe beings we are no way bound to believe, becauſe it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. So that though we can not conceive, nor ſtand bound to believe, how, or after what manner the divine Perſon differeth from the divine Eſſence; nor again this Eſſence from ſuch a Perſon, yet we may and do ſtand bound to believe that they are diſtinguiſhed; the Scripture revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this, and not the other. This for reply to the Argument propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas the Argument affirmeth; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> 
                  <hi>That it is impoſſible for any man to diſtinguiſh the Perſon from the Eſſence of God, and not to frame two beings in his mind, and conſequently two Gods.</hi> We reply fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That this is manifeſtly untrue, if by <hi>two beings</hi> he meaneth two things compleatly? ſubſiſting each a part by it ſelf; as for inſtance: In Intellectual created Beings I can conceive a man, or the perſon of a man; and again, the humane Nature or Eſſence of a man (which differs from his Perſon; for a man, as <hi>Thomas,</hi> or any other, is not the Humane
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95016:116"/>Nature, but only partakes of it, or ſubſiſts in it;) I ſay, I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in my mind the Perſon of <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the Nature of <hi>Thomas,</hi> and yet not conceive two things compleatly and a part ſubſiſting, and conſequently not conceive two <hi>Thomaſes:</hi> For the Nature of <hi>Thomas,</hi> I mean, the Humane Nature, doth not any where ſubſiſt in <hi>Thomas</hi> his perſon a part by it ſelf, but only in the ſeveral and reſpective perſons of mankind: In like manner, I can very well conceive in my mind a divine Perſon, for inſtance the Father, or the Son; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe can conceive the divine Nature and Eſſence; and yet not neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive or frame two beings, <hi>i.e.</hi> two things completely and apart ſubſiſting in my mind; for the Divine Nature or Eſſence doth not really ſubſiſt apart from, or out of the divine Perſons, which partakes therein, be they one, or be they more; as the Humane Nature doth not any where ſubſiſt but in <hi>Thomas, John,</hi> and the reſt of the individual perſons of mankind who partake of this nature. But though the Divine Eſſence be one and the ſame thing really and ſubſtantially with a divine Perſon, and with all the Three, yet doth it differ from it in conſideration and reſpect; ſo that I may conceive a divine perſon in my mind, and conceive the divine Eſſence alſo, and yet not neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive two things really diſtinct (much leſs two Gods) but two things diſtinct only in conſideration, but really one and the ſame. As in the divine Attributes the Juſtice of God and the Mercy of God (and ſo the Wiſdome, Patience, Goodneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) they are really one and the ſame thing in God; but they differ in conſideration; for when I conceive or conſider the Juſtice of God, the inward conception of my mind diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth much from that which I raiſe or conceive within me when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Mercy or Wiſdom of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo again, <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of the Faithful are really but one and the ſame thing, yet differ in conſideration or reſpect; for when I conceive of him, or conſider him as the Father of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> my conſideration is differing much from what it is when I conceive of him as the Father of the Faitful. I might inſtance in thoſe and many more particulars which are really one and the ſame, and yet may truly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered or conceived in my mind very differently; ſo that it is but an illiterate and weak Allegation to affirm, <hi>That it is impoſſible for a man to diſtinguiſh the Perſon from the Eſſence of God, and not to frame two things or beings in my mind,</hi> and conſequently two Gods. Why may I not as well diſtinguiſh the Perſon from the Eſſence of God without fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in my mind two Gods, as diſtinguiſh the Perſon of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, as <hi>Gabriel, Michael,</hi> or the like, from the common Eſſence or Nature of Angels, wherein both <hi>Gabriel, Michael,</hi> and other Angels partake? That is to be taken along as a general Rule in all diſputes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, and the divine Nature, that when we borrow reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances or notions from one kind or other, from the Creature to explain
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95016:117"/>matters relating unto God, it is not to be expected that theſe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances or notions ſhould hold in all particulars, nor neceſſarily in any more than in that one only, unto which they are applied, <hi>viz.</hi> When we ſhew and prove, that a man may very well diſtinguiſh the Perſon from the Eſſence of God, without framing any ſuch thing in his mind which ſhould imply two Gods; by ſhewing that a man may diſtinguiſh the perſon of an Angel or a man from the common Nature or Eſſence of either, without framing in his mind either two Angels, or two men: it cannot be excepted againſt this proof or reſemblance, that it is not pertinent, or that it reacheth not the buſineſs for which it is brought, becauſe the perſon of an Angel (and ſo of a man) as well as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Eſſence of both are finite beings; whereas a divine Perſon and the divine Eſſence are both infinite, or the like. The notion or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon is ſufficient for that end for which it is uſed and inſiſted upon, if by way of ſimilitude it ſheweth and proveth that a man may frame in his mind a diſtinct conſideration of a perſon ſubſiſting in, or partaking of ſuch or ſuch a Nature or Eſſence; and again, of this Nature or Eſſence, wherein they do partake, without framing a conceit of two ſuch things which ſhould imply or include two perſons of either kind.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) For anſwer to our Adverſaries firſt Reaſon againſt diſtinguiſhing the Perſon of God from the Eſſence of God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> if himſelf grant both, which clearly he ſeems to do (neither was there ever any man yet who acknowledge a God that denied either) <hi>viz.</hi> That there is a divine Nature and Eſſence; and again, that there is a perſon (ſuppoſe one only, as his erroneous ſuppoſition indeed is;) who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the Nature; then himſelf owns and grants the diſtinction which with ſo much clamour he falls foul upon. When he ſaith in his third and laſt Reaſon againſt the ſaid diſtinction, That <hi>to talk of God taken only eſſentially is ridiculous,</hi> he clearly granteth and ſuppoſeth, that God may be taken <hi>Eſſentially</hi> (though not <hi>Eſſentially</hi> only) and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that there is a <hi>divine Eſſence</hi> as well as a <hi>divine Perſon:</hi> if ſo, Why may I not conceive and conſider in my mind as well the one as the other? Or what is this but to diſtinguiſh the one from the other? Or when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acknowledged as well the one as the other, did he acknowledge them under one and the ſame notion or inward conception of them in his mind; ſo that when he acknowledged a divine Perſon, he had no other notion and impreſſion in his mind than he had when he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a divine Nature or Eſſence? Now then this is that, I ſay, if he did thus acknowledge or thus conceive of them, then is he himſelf guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that <hi>preſumption,</hi> which he chargeth upon his Adverſaries (as we heard) <hi>viz.</hi> Of <hi>affirming that of the unſearchable Nature of God, which he hath not firſt affirmed of himſelf in the Scriptures.</hi> For moſt certain it is, that God hath affirmed no ſuch thing of himſelf here, <hi>viz.</hi> That
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95016:117"/>the divine Perſon and his divine Nature or Eſſence are to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and conceived by one and the ſelf ſame notion or conception in the minds of men, without any variation or diſtinction at all. So that the Adverſaries firſt Reaſon againſt the forementioned diſtinction of God taken Perſonally and Eſſentially is very weak, and hath nothing of weight or ſtrength in it; and what there is in it, it is every whit as much againſt himſelf, as thoſe whom he would ſeem to oppoſe.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Reaſon againſt the ſaid Diſtinction he draweth up in theſe words: <hi>If the Perſon be diſtinct from the Eſſence of God,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> 
                  <hi>then it is either ſomething, or nothing; If nothing, How can it be diſtinguiſhed, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath no accidents? If ſomething, then either it is ſome finite or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite thing: If finite, then there will be ſomething finite in God; and conſequently, ſince by the confeſſion of the Adverſaries themſelves, every thing in God, is God himſelf, God will be finite; which the Adverſaries themſelves will likewiſe confeſs to be abſurd: If infinite, then there will be two infinites in God, to wit the Perſon and Eſſence of God, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, two Gods, which is more abſurd than the former.</hi> This is the account of his ſecond Reaſon againſt the oft mentioned diſtinction; but that this alſo is of the ſame calculation with the former, and hath as little in it as that; and that which it hath is as much againſt himſelf as his Adverſaries, may be made readily to appear. For Firſt,</p>
               <p>Whereas he reaſoneth thus: <hi>If the Perſon be diſtinguiſhed from the Eſſence of God, then it is either ſomething or nothing;</hi> there is no great weight either of Learning, or Underſtanding in the Propoſition. For firſt, In the former part of this Propoſition, <hi>If the Perſon be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Eſſence of God,</hi> he ſuppoſeth the Perſon to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what; otherwiſe the meaning of the clauſe ſhould be this, If nothing, or that which is nothing, <hi>be diſtinct from the Eſſence of God,</hi> which is ridiculous. And yet having thus in the former part of the Propoſition ſuppoſed it to be ſomewhat; from this ſuppoſition in the latter part of it he infers it to be either ſomething or nothing. Who ever reaſoned at ſuch a rate as this, If nothing be diſtinct from ſomething, then is it either ſomething or nothing? They that can make ſenſe of this muſt have ſharper underſtandings than mine. Secondly, Let the word <hi>Perſon</hi> in the Antecedent of the Propoſition be ſuppoſed to ſignifie either ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or nothing; either that which is, or that which is not; yet it doth not follow that it ſhould be determinately either ſomething or nothing from hence, becauſe it is diſtinct from the Eſſence of God: ſo that the Major Propoſition in this Syllogiſm vaniſheth into a meer Nothing. Thirdly, Whereas in the proceſs of his Argument he reaſoneth thus: <hi>If finite</hi> [meaning, if a Perſon be finite.] <hi>then there will be ſomething finite in God; if infinite, then there will be two infinites in God, the Perſon and the Eſſence,</hi> both which (he preſumeth) are accounted abſurd by
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95016:118"/>his Adverſaries themſelves. We reply, Firſt, that whatſoever his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do in the caſe, he himſelf holdeth, not only that there is ſomething finite in God, but that all things appertaining to him are finite: For holding the Eſſence of God to be finite and locally circumſcribed, he muſt conſequently hold and maintain, that all other things belonging to his Eſſence are finite and circumſcribed alſo; ſo that it is no abſurdity with him to grant that there is ſomething finite in God: But he that granteth Paſſions alſo properly and formally ſo called in God, as Anger, Grief, Sorrow; and conſequently, an obnoxiouſneſs or an expoſedneſs unto Trouble, Pain, Torment, yea, and death it ſelf (for all this directly followeth upon ſuch a Tenent:) it is no marvel if he holds all things finite in God. But ſecondly, I reply further, that it no way follows, that if a perſon be infinite, and the Eſſence infinite, that there ſhould be two infinites in God; The Reaſon is plain, becauſe the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the Eſſence are not two things really diſtinct the one from the other, but in conſideration only. That is a common and true Saying amongſt Divines, <hi>In Trinitate omnia ſunt unum ubi non obviat relationis oppoſitio:</hi> All things in the Trinity are one, excepting only where the oppoſition of relation cometh in the way: <hi>viz.</hi> The Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father, nor the Holy Ghoſt either, nor either the Holy Ghoſt; yet they are all one and the ſame Eſſence, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently one and the ſame Infinite; yet doth it not follow, that becauſe there are more perſons, or a plurality of perſons, that therefore there is a plurality, or more than one Eſſence; for it is the Eſſence to which properly or primarily the Attributes do belong, and not the Perſons. I beſeech you mind this Rule, which will give a great light into this deep Myſtery: It is the Eſſence to which properly and primarily the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes do belong, and not the perſon; they do belong indeed to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but only in conſideration of the Eſſence whereof each Perſon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes. As for inſtance, the Father is not infinite (and ſo is not Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient and Omnipreſent) becauſe he is the Father, but becauſe he is God, <hi>i.e.</hi> becauſe he partakes and ſubſiſts in the Divine Eſſence: So likewiſe the Second Perſon, the Son, is not therefore infinite, becauſe he is a Perſon, or becauſe he is the Son, but becauſe he is God, <hi>i. e.</hi> one and the ſame really with the Divine Eſſence; there is the ſame reaſon of the Holy Ghoſt. So that though the Father be infinite, and the Son infinite, and the Holy Ghoſt infinite, and the Divine Eſſence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; yet it doth not follow, that there ſhould be three infinites, or any more than one, becauſe the Eſſence is but one to which the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of Infinity belongeth. And the Perſons, as they partake of the Divine Eſſence, which is but one, ſo they partake of the Infinity belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this Eſſence, which is but one neither. As it may be truly ſaid that <hi>Sarahs</hi> Husband had a great Eſtate, and <hi>Iſaac's</hi> Father had a great Eſtate, and the Father of the Faithful had a great Eſtate, yet it will
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95016:118"/>not follow, that therefore here were three great Eſtates; the Reaſon is, becauſe all the Relations were really founded in one and the ſelf-ſame perſon called <hi>Abraham;</hi> and the Eſtate did not belong to him either as he was <hi>Sarahs</hi> Husband, or <hi>Iſaac's</hi> Father, or the Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but as he was ſuch a perſon enriched by God. I might ſhew you further how the divine Attributes (as we call them) are founded, not in the Perſon, but in the Eſſence: But this ſufficeth for reply to the ſecond Reaſon againſt the diſtinction of God taken Eſſentially and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) The laſt Reaſon againſt the diſtinction of God taken Perſonally and Eſſentially, take it in his own words: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> 
                  <hi>Thirdly to talk of God taken only Eſſentially is ridiculous; not only becauſe there is no Example thereof in the Scripture, but becauſe God is the name of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſignifieth him that ruleth over others; and when it is put for the moſt High God, it denoteth him, who with ſoveraign and abſolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ruleth over all: But none but a Perſon can rule over others, all acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being proper to perſons; wherefore to take God otherwiſe than Perſonally, is to take him otherwiſe than he is, and indeed to miſtake him.</hi> To this alſo we reply.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When he ſaith, <hi>That to talk of God taken only Eſſentially is ridiculous;</hi> how ridiculouſly himſelf ſpeaketh hath been formerly ſhewed in part, and will further appear when we ſhall weigh the grounds of his windy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the balance of the Sanctuary. For firſt, Whereas he ſaith, <hi>There is no example in the Scripture,</hi> this ſaying of his hath already been weighed and found too light.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When he ſaith, <hi>That God is the name of a Perſon, and when it is, put for the moſt High God, it denoteth him, who with ſoveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ruleth over all,</hi> &amp;c. We reply, by denying that God is alwaies the name of a Perſon. For when we ſay that the Father is God, and again, that the Son is God, the word God is not the name of a Perſon, nor doth it ſignifie a Perſon as ſuch: But rather the Divine Nature and Eſſence, wherein both the Father and the Son equally partake (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our ſenſe, and the truth it ſelf:) And in the ſenſe of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, who denieth the Son to be the ſame God with the Father, yet granteth him to be God, it muſt needs ſignifie or denote ſome property, priviledge, or the like, wherein they both partake. For certainly, the Son can in no ſenſe whatſoever be termed God, unleſs there be ſame Agreement, Similitude, or Partnerſhip in ſomething or other with him that is God indeed (or as our Adverſaries love to ſpeak) the moſt High God; ſo that when (according to the ſame ſenſe of our Adverſaries) the Son is called God, the word God doth not denote the proper name of a perſon, but denoteth, and is a word importing ſomething that is common to more perſons than one.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) When he ſaith, <hi>That when it is put for the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95016:119"/>moſt High God, it ſignifieth him that with ſoveraign Authority ruleth over all;</hi> and addeth, <hi>That all Actions are proper unto perſons,</hi> &amp;c. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and grant all this to be true, But add (by way of Explication of our ſenſe in this grant) that though the word God, when ſpoken of the moſt High God, denoteth him that ruleth over all; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a perſon, becauſe Actions are proper unto Perſons, and not unto Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or Eſſences: Yet it doth not neceſſarily denote any one perſon deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately, or with the excluſion of all others, but may ſignifie either the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Ghoſt: For it is true, that every one of them joyntly and ſeverally hath abſolute authority over all: And (as we lately heard) the Apoſtle, ſpeaking particularly of the Second Perſon Chriſt, calleth him (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5.) <gap reason="foreign">

Doubtleſs, he that is over all is the <hi>moſt High God;</hi> we do not hold or teach, that the Divine Nature, or Eſſence, as ſuch, ruleth over all, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth any action; but only as perſonally ſubſiſting in, or communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. And this for reply to this firſt Argument, by which he endeavoureth to prove the Son to be a ſack cloath, the Holy Ghoſt to be a Creature, and not God. His ſecond Argument is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If he,</hi>

                  <hi>that gave the Holy Spirit to the Iſraelites to inſtruct them, be God or Jehovah alone, then the Holy Spirit is not Jehovah or God: but he that gave the Holy Spirit to the Iſraelites to inſtruct them is Jehovah alone, therefore the Holy Spirit is not God. The ſequel of the Major is plain; for if he that gave the Holy Spirit be Jehovah alone, and yet the Holy Spirit that was given be Jehovah too; the ſame will be Jehovah alone, and not Jehovah alone, which implieth a contradiction.</hi> The Minor (he ſaith) is evidenced by <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.6, 20. To this we reply briefly, that the ſequel of the Major Propoſition, as <hi>plain</hi> as the Author of it would ſuppoſe it to be, is reprovable, and to be denied; though he that gave the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> be <hi>Jehovah</hi> alone, yet may the Holy Spirit, who is ſaid to have been given, be <hi>Jehovah</hi> alſo: Nor doth it imply any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that the ſame [that is, the ſame perſon, or the ſame being] ſhould be <hi>Jehovah</hi> alone, and not <hi>Jehovah</hi> alone, <hi>viz.</hi> in different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects and conſiderations; as thus, the Father (and there is the ſame reaſon of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt) may be <hi>Jehovah</hi> alone, [<hi>viz.</hi> the excluſive Particle <hi>alone</hi> excludes all Creatures, or all Beings what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, which are not one and the ſame with his Being] and yet not be <hi>Jehovah</hi> alone, if by the Particle <hi>alone</hi> we intend to exclude the Son and the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly Ghoſt, being one and the ſame God, or Being with him. For the Son may be ſaid to be <hi>Jehovah</hi> alone, and the Holy Ghoſt <hi>Jehovah</hi> alone as well as the Father. It is a Rule in Logick, <hi>Ezcluſiva particula
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95016:119"/>ſubjecti non excludit concomitantia:</hi> An excluſive Particle annexed to the ſubject in a Propoſition doth not exclude ſuch things as are concomitant to the ſubject, or inſeparable from it, but only theſe, whether Things or Perſons, that are of a forein conſideration, as when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.27. <hi>No man knoweth the Son but the Father,</hi> which is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to this, only the Father knoweth the Son; the meaning is not to exclude the Holy Ghoſt from this knowledge of the Son, becauſe only the Father is ſaid to know him; the Reaſon is, becauſe the Holy Ghoſt is one and the ſame God, and ſo one and the ſame in knowledge with the Father. So likewiſe when the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. <hi>The things of God knoweth none</hi> (for ſo it is in the Original, <hi>not no man</hi>) <hi>but the Spirit;</hi> his meaning is not to exclude the Son of God from knowing theſe things as well as the Spirit himſelf; Becauſe there being an <gap reason="foreign">

If a man ſhould ſay, only <hi>Abraham, Sarahs</hi> Husband, was a rich man in his daies, it would not follow from hence, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iſaac's</hi> Father was not a rich man, or that the Father of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was not a rich man. That he that gave the Holy Spirit unto the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the Spirit who was given, may well be, and are one and the ſelf ſame <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ſhall be ſhewed when we come to the ſeventh Argument; In the mean ſeaſon, you may pleaſe only to take notice of that of our Saviour in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.30. <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> We know the Father is ſaid to have given his Son as well as his Spirit, and yet we hear from Chriſt himſelf, that the giver and the gift, or he that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, are one; ſo that though God the Father be he that gave the Son, the Son was he that was given, or the gift, yet notwithſtanding our Saviour pronounceth that he and his Father, <hi>i. e.</hi> the giver and the gift, were one.</p>
               <p>His third Argument is this; <hi>He that ſpeaketh not of himſelf,</hi>

               <p>To this Argument and Diſcourſe we anſwer; Firſt, By diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Phraſe or Expreſſion, <hi>ſpeaking and not ſpeaking</hi> of himſelf, uſed in both Propoſitions of the firſt Syllogiſm. A perſon may be ſaid not <hi>to ſpeak of himſelf</hi> two waies, or in two ſeveral conſiderations: Firſt, (As our Adverſary well informeth us from the ſeveral Texts of Scripture which he mentioneth in the cloſe of his Argument) when he ſpeaketh by the <hi>ſhewing, teaching, commanding, authorizing, or enabling of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, viz.</hi> that is extraeſſential to him, and this kind of not ſpeaking <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, of himſelf is indeed incompatible (as he truly ſaith) with God, or with him that is truly God; he that ſpeaketh not of himſelf, but by the teaching, authorizing, or commanding of another, really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from him that ſpeaketh, moſt certainly cannot be God:</p>
               <p>Secondly, A perſon may be ſaid not to ſpeak of himſelf (the main ſtrength, ſubtilty, and fallacy of this Argument lieth in that Phraſe of himſelf) <hi>viz.</hi> when he doth not ſpeak <hi>of himſelf</hi> alone, or without the co-ſpeaking of another perſon with him; for this you are to know and remember, that many times the excluſive Particles <hi>only</hi> and <hi>alone</hi> are not expreſſed in the Scriptures when yet (indeed) they are to be neceſſarily underſtood; thus, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. and ſo again 10.20. where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaks thus unto the people, <hi>Thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, and ſerve him;</hi> the meaning is, Thou ſhalt ſerve him only or alone, as our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, citing the place in the New Teſtament, expoundeth it, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only</hi> or <hi>alone ſhalt thou ſerve,</hi> Mat. 4.10.

We might add for the further clearing of the Phraſe of himſelf, that we find in <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.51. where the Evangeliſt ſpeaketh concerning the ſpeech of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High Prieſt, that it was expedient that one man ſhould die for the People, and not the whole Nation to periſh: <hi>This</hi> (ſaith the Holy Ghoſt here of him) <hi>ſpake he not of himſelf, but as being High Prieſt.</hi> Now the meaning hereof is not as if that <hi>Caiaphas</hi> had this ſaying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated unto him, or as if he were any way authorized, or countenanced, or had the ſaying ſuggeſted unto him from another; or that there was another that did over-rule, and guide, and govern his lips or his tongue in bringing forth ſuch a ſaying: For the meaning cannot be, that he ſpake it from the Holy Ghoſt, for certainly the Holy Ghoſt could not be the Author of any ſuch Counſel of putting the Lord of Life to death, nor any way encouraging or aiding to ſuch a work as this; but yet the Holy Ghoſt had a hand in the buſineſs, not in ſuggeſting the Notion or wicked Counſel into the High Prieſt; but he did over-rule and cauſe his Tongue to iſſue ſuch words and ſayings, which having another Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in his heart, it is like, if he had been left unto himſelf, he would have brought out ſome other kind of way, and ſaid ſomething which would have tended to the deſtroying or taking away the life of Chriſt; but that it was brought out in that form of words, which had a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical face in them, there was ſome kind of interpoſure of the Holy Ghoſt, as there is in many Actions and ſinful Sayings of men; many times their tongues are over-ruled, though the ſubſtance of what they ſay is evil, yet there are ſome ſtrains in it which are from a Principle Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour unto themſelves. Now (I ſay) apply we the diſtinction of the Phraſe (ſpeaking not of himſelf) to the Argument, and you will
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95016:121"/>readily find the weakneſs and inſufficiency of it: And that there are four terms, which alwaies make a fallacious Syllogiſm; that is, if the ſame words be taken in one ſenſe in one Propoſition, and in another ſenſe in the other Propoſition, this now maketh four terms, and ſo maketh the Syllogiſm void and inconcluſive of any thing: So much for this Argument, He that ſpeaketh not of himſelf is not God, the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh not of himſelf, therefore he is not God. If we take the Phraſe <hi>ſpeaking not of himſelf,</hi> in the latter ſenſe explained, ſo the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Propoſition is falſe; for he may be, yea, and truly is God, who (in this ſenſe) <hi>ſpeaketh not of himſelf, i.e.</hi> who ſpeaketh not but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with others. If you take the ſaid words in the former ſenſe, ſo the Major Propoſition is true, but the Minor is falſe; For the Holy Spirit doth ſpeak of himſelf in this ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> he ſpeaketh the ſame thing with the Father and the Son, and doth not ſpeak by the motion or direction of any perſon or being ſeparated from him.</p>
               <p>The fourth Argument is of affinity with the former, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> and preſenteth it ſelf in this form, <hi>He that heareth from another what he ſhall ſpeak, is not God; the Holy Ghoſt doth ſo, therefore he is not God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Argument is drawn up in many ſwelling words, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſome of the reſt, but the ſinews and ſtrength of it lyeth in this; that the Holy Ghoſt in the Scripture is ſaid to hear from another that which he ſpeaks or reveals unto men, or which he did reveal unto the Apoſtles; and that from hence it follows (according to our Saviours ſuppoſition, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.26. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 28.) that he is taught by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and conſequently cannot be God. The life and ſoul of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is bound up in this ſmall bundle of words, therefore we reply briefly to it.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the very bottom and foundation upon which this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtandeth is craſie and looſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That he <hi>that heareth from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what he ſhould ſpeak, is taught,</hi> if by being taught, he means the receiving of new knowledge, or of the knowledge of things which we knew not of before (which he muſt mean, if he means any thing with ſenſe:) For many may hear from another what they are, or ought to ſpeak, without being taught (in ſuch a ſenſe) as when a Jury of men give in a Verdict upon Oath, it doth not follow, that he that ſpeaks or gives in his Teſtimony in the ſecond or third place is taught by him that ſpeaks the ſame thing before him in his hearing, for he may ſpeak the ſame thing out of his own Judgment and Conſcience, and which he was otherwiſe reſolved to ſpeak, though he had not heard it ſpoken by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before he utters it; and ſo they who ſpend their time in the ſtudy of the Scriptures, and in the ſearching after truth, may find that ſpoken or written (which is equivalent to hearing, and is hearing in a ſenſe) by another, which yet falls in with their own thoughts and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions formerly conceived in this caſe, they may be ſaid to hear that
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95016:121"/>from another which they ſpeak, and yet not be taught. Therefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas he labours to prove the truth of that aſſertion from theſe two paſſages of the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.26, &amp; 28. compared together, his labour is in vain, for his proof is notoriouſly defective and weak, and this upon a double account: For firſt, he takes that for granted which he ſhould have proved, as being no waies evident in it ſelf. And ſecondly, He ſuppoſeth, that if it be true in one caſe, that he that heareth from another what he ſhall ſpeak, is taught; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be true in all caſes, which is very ridiculous. Firſt, That which he takes for granted in his proof from theſe paſſages is, That our Saviour in the latter of the places, expoundeth himſelf in the former, or that he ſpeaketh one and the ſame thing for ſubſtance of Notion in them both: This (I ſay) no way appears, nor (indeed) is much probable. For when in the former place he ſpeaks thus, <hi>But he that ſent me is true, and I ſpeak to the world thoſe things which I have heard of him;</hi> very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it is, that he ſpeaks of the ineffable and unconceivable hearing, whereby all the three Perſons hear one another ſpeaking the ſame things, according to that of the ſame Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one.</hi> If they all bear record in Heaven, doubtleſs they hear one another, or one from another. Or elſe our Saviour (in the words mentioned) may be conceived to ſpeak of the Eternal hearing from the Father, which is appropriate to him as being his Son by Eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; for the Father, communicating one and the ſame Divine Nature or Eſſence with himſelf unto the Son by Eternal Generation, muſt needs communicate all the Divine Attributes and Perfections together with it, being (indeed) but one and the ſame thing with it: and amongſt the reſt, that infinite knowledge and underſtanding which is proper to it; which communication of knowledge may properly enough be termed Chriſt's <hi>hearing of the Father.</hi> Again, When he ſaith in the latter place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.28. he ſaith, <hi>According as the Father hath taught me theſe things I ſpeak;</hi> He ſpeaks of his teaching, or being taught as man, or as Mediator, in which reſpect he is elſewhere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ermed the ſervant of God, and his <hi>Father ſaid to be greater than he.</hi> And conſequently, he muſt be inferiour to the Father, and ſo may properly enough be ſaid to be taught by him. And that (indeed) he ſpeaks here of his being taught as man, appeareth from the next Verſe, but that we muſt not ſtand to ſcan all things. Thus you ſee our Adverſary in the main proof of his Argument takes that for granted which is not only queſtionable, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, but improbable alſo in the higheſt. Again,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe that which he taketh for granted without proof, or probability in the caſe before us ſhould be granted unto him, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Saviour by hearing of the Father, and by being taught by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, meaneth one and the ſame thing; or explaineth the one by the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95016:122"/>other; yet it no way followeth, that therefore all hearing and all teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be the ſame; or that every one that heareth of another what he ſhall ſpeak ſhould be taught by him: We gave a ſufficient account of this lately, it is a weak kind of arguing to reaſon thus; Such and ſuch words or Phraſes are to be taken in ſuch and ſuch a ſenſe in this, or in that place of Scripture, therefore they are to be ſo taken in all others. So that this Argument alſo is of the ſame Houſe and Linage with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; only before we diſmiſs it, it may not be unworthy of your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, how ſtrangely God blindeth the eyes of him that compoſed the Argument, when towards the beginning of it, to prove that the Holy Spirit is taught, and heareth from another what he ſhall ſpeak, he refers us to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.13, 14. which place expreſly teacheth the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Spirit of God hath none to teach or direct him, the tenour of the place is this, <hi>Who hath directed the Spirit of the Lord, or being his Counſellor hath taught him? With whom took he counſel, or who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him, and taught him in the path of Judgment, and taught him knowledge, and ſhewed to him the way of underſtanding?</hi> I know not what words can with more pregnant and expreſs emphaticalneſs aſſert the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceivedneſs of the wiſdom and knowledge of the Holy Ghoſt than theſe. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> maketh this an Argument or ſign of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of men from the Tents of ſuch perſons who are ſecret Enemies unto God, <hi>viz.</hi> making their Tongues to fall upon themſelves, that is, their uttering and ſpeaking ſuch things which apparently make againſt their own intereſt and deſigns, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 64.8. So they ſhall make their own Tongues to fall upon themſelves, all that ſee them [<hi>viz.</hi> thus enſnared and entangled] ſhall fly away: that is, ſhall forſake their party, ſhall no longer be confederate with them. This for his fourth Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The fifth Argument followeth: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> 
                  <hi>He that receiveth of another is not God; the Holy Spirit doth ſo</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> receiveth of another] <hi>therefore he is not God.</hi> The Minor is witneſſed from <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.14. The Major is proved thus; God is he that giveth all things unto all, wherefore if there be any one that receiveth of another, he cannot be God. The Antecedent is plain from <hi>Acts</hi> 17.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35, 36. The Conſequence is undeniable, becauſe he that is deficient is not God, he that receiveth from another is deficient, therefore he is not God. The Major is unqueſtionable, for to ſay one is deficient (which implyeth imperfection) and yet is God, is in effect to ſay, that he is God and not God. This is the compaſs likewiſe of the fifth Argument; the ſtrength of this Argument, ſuch as it is, is eaſie enough to be diſcerned: the ſtreſs of it reſteth upon theſe words of Chriſt (as you may perceive) concerning the Spirit (<hi>Joh.</hi> 16.14.) <hi>He ſhall take of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you:</hi> becauſe he is here ſaid to be a <hi>Receiver,</hi> therefore our Adverſary cannot allow him to be God; becauſe (ſaith he) God is he that gives all things unto all, and it
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95016:122"/>implieth a contradiction, that he that giveth all things unto all ſhould receive any thing from any; but amongſt all his Arguments this is the firſt born amongſt the poor. For,</p>
               <p>I reply firſt, Though God in a ſenſe be ſaid to give all things unto all, yet withal he is ſaid alſo in a ſenſe proper enough to receive ſeveral things. and this without any contradiction at all: He is ſaid to receive the Prayers of his Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.9. To receive the Saints themſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.15. &amp; 73.24. To receive comfort, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.6. And ſo to receive <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>power, Rev.</hi> 4.11. Therefore this Propoſition is moſt untrue, <hi>He that receiveth of another is not God;</hi> yea, he may be, and is God, who receiveth ſomething from another (as we have heard.) Nor <hi>is it the proper notion of dependency to receive of another,</hi> theſe things are very looſely and unduly affirmed. God is ſometimes (in Scriptures) ſaid to give all things unto all, becauſe he giveth unto all all things which they ſtand poſſeſſed of; He gives them Faculties, Principles, Strength, and means to do all things which they do; and in this ſenſe he may be ſaid to give them all the actions, motions, and workings alſo, which they act and work, and conſequently thoſe very Praiſes and acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which yet he receiveth from them too: As for example, He that gives a man money wherewith to buy ſuch a commodity, he may very properly be ſaid to give him the things which are purchaſed with the money; (And ſo the Scripture Phraſe runneth, for he is thy money, ſpeaking of the Servant:) So when God e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dneth a Creature with ſtrength and power to get wealth, he may be ſaid to give him wealth it ſelf, which he did allow him by means of that power and underſtanding infuſed into him. God's giving all things unto all in this ſenſe doth not hinder but that he may receive alſo many of theſe very things which he giveth in the ſenſe declared: therefore it is no infallible Character of a true God not to receive from another. The Apoſtle himſelf in that very Scripture which the Argument citeth, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.25. ſaying, That <hi>God is not to be worſhipped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing,</hi> clearly implieth, that God may receive things from his Creatures: but not upon any ſuch account as this; <hi>viz. As if he needed any thing;</hi> meaning, for he bettering of his own condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or compleating of his happineſs; and unleſs our Adverſary can prove that the Holy Ghoſt received what was Chriſts, for his own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities and ſupplies; The ſimple receiving of it doth no way incumber the plea of his Godhead. 2. When our Saviour, ſpeaking of the Holy Ghoſt, ſaith, <hi>He ſhall receive,</hi> or ſhall take (as the word ſignifieth, and is accordingly tranſlated in the next verſe) <hi>of mine, and ſhall ſhew it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you,</hi> he doth not imply as if the Holy Ghoſt had not then, when Chriſt thus ſpake, received or taken that, or thoſe things of his: for it is certain that he had taken theſe things of Chriſt under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and had revealed them unto the Prophets of God, and other
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:95016:123"/>holy men, and by theſe unto the World, as is very evident from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scriptures; yea, certain it is that he had received them from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but our Saviour's meaning in the Clauſe or Phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>He ſhall take of that which is mine,</hi> ſeems to be this; That whereas the Holy Ghoſt had, (<hi>viz.</hi> in his mind or underſtanding) both at preſent, and ever before, abundance of that which was Chriſts, even his whole Treaſury, his relation to his Father, his Godhead, his Incarnation, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Grace, Love, Sweetneſs, Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with all his Counſels, Purpoſes, and Intentions concerning the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſhould (when he ſhould viſibly be given, and come unto them) take not ſimply this, or all this: But he ſhould take (<hi>viz.</hi> of himſelf, and out of the Treaſury of his own underſtanding) ſo much, or ſuch particulars concerning Chriſt to reveal unto them which ſhould be neceſſary for them to know, either for their own comfort, or to furniſh or accompliſh them for the great Office and work of Apoſtles in the World. So that the word <hi>take</hi> in this place, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall take of mine,</hi> is uſed in ſome ſuch ſenſe as when a man is ſaid to take a thing which is already his own, or in his own poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, only in order to the doing of ſomething with it; in this ſenſe God ſaith, (<hi>Zach.</hi> 11.10.) <hi>I took my ſtaff, even beauty, and cut it aſunder;</hi> The ſtaffe he ſpeaks of was in his poſſeſſion before, only he is ſaid to have <hi>taken</hi> it, in order to cutting it aſunder. So again, <hi>The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> (Mat. 13.33.) <hi>is like unto Leaven, which a woman took and hid in three meaſures of meal;</hi> to name no more places in this kind, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, which a man took and ſowed in his Field</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. So in the words before us, <hi>The Spirit ſhall take of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you, i. e.</hi> From amongſt many other things which he knows concerning me; he ſhall take ſuch and ſuch which ſhall be needful for you to know, <hi>and ſhall reveal them unto you.</hi> Even as a prudent Miniſter, <hi>or Scribe inſtructed for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven,</hi> (As our Saviour ſpeaks) out of the rich and full trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his underſtanding taketh and chuſeth ſuch and ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar notions, and veins of ſpiritual truth, relating unto God and Jeſus Chriſt, which he judgeth meet to be delivered and imparted to ſuch and ſuch a people. The words, taken in ſuch a ſenſe as this, do no way fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the dangerous conceit of our Adverſaries, that the Holy Ghoſt is not God. There is another ſenſe likewiſe wherein the Holy Ghoſt may be ſaid to receive that which is Chriſts, which is ſo far from impairing his Divinity, or Godhead, that it fully aſſerts and confirms it: But this being ſomewhat myſterious, and requiring ſome larger Explication, we ſhall not (at preſent) dive into it: that which hath been given is more obvious and agreeable to the words and ſcope of the place, and ſufficient to detect the vanity of the Argument built upon it, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Deity or Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt. And this for the fifth Argument.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:95016:123"/>
               <p>The ſixth Argument riſeth thus: <hi>He that is ſent by another is not God;</hi>

                  <hi>the Holy Spirit is ſent by another, therefore He is not God.</hi> The Minor is proved from <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.26. The Major, he that miniſtreth is not God; this is the whole compaſs of the ſixth Argument. The ſubſtance and ſtrength of this Argument is, That to be ſent forth by another to miniſter and to receive commands are things incompatible to the Soveraign Majeſty of God; and that theſe are in Scripture affirmed of the Holy Ghoſt, therefore he cannot be God. To this we reply:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the man being a perfect Anthropomorphite, notioning and conceiving that all thoſe things which are attributed unto God in the Scriptures, after the manner of men, as bodily members, humane paſſions, a circumſcriptiveneſs unto place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are in the litteral and proper nature and formality of them to be found in him, builds his Arguments upon this ſandy and rotten foundation: And becauſe it is ſo with men, that he that is ſent, or ſent forth by another is inferiour to him that ſends him (though this be not alwaies ſo neither as we ſhall ſee preſently) he therefore conceiveth, that when theſe things are ſpoken of Chriſt, or of the Holy Ghoſt, they muſt be underſtood litterally and formally of them alſo; whereas, if we do but own and acknowledge the infinity and incomprehenſibleneſs of God, we muſt of neceſſity ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of, and own that Rule delivered long ſince by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, and ever and anon remembred by all learned men that have written of theſe things, <hi>Quando humana transferuntur ad Deum,</hi> &amp;c. When things properly belonging unto men, are transferred over unto God, they are to be underſtood, ſo that no diſhonour nor diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be offered unto the Divine Nature, and whatſoever in them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports imperfection is to be ſeparated and left behind, and only that to be conceived to be meant of God which implieth perfection; for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever proceeds from God, ſo far as it cometh from him, hath no imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in it; therefore nothing which includes imperfection in it, ſo far as it includes it, can be with truth attributed unto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When the Holy Ghoſt (and there is the ſame conſideration of the Son in this reſpect) is in Scripture ſaid to be ſent, whether by the Son, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.26. or by the Father, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.26. it doth not imply either ſubjection or inferiority to either of the Perſons ſending, becauſe ſubjection ſavoureth of imperfection. Nor ſecondly doth it imply any removal from place to place, for this alſo ſavoureth of Creature-like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection not to be preſent every where at once, Nor thirdly doth it imply Miniſtery or Service properly ſo called, <hi>i. e.</hi> The doing of any thing, in the fruit and benefit whereof he that is ſent hath not an equal intereſt or ſhare with him that ſendeth him; For this alſo implies ſome kind of imperfection. If you ask me, What then doth it imply?</p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt, It implies the plurality of beings or ſubſiſtencies which
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95016:124"/>we call perſons in the Divine Eſſence; for the ſender and he that is ſent muſt needs be more than one.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It implies another thing, as namely, the order of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons between themſelves; For he that is ſent muſt in order, though not in nature or dignity, be after him that ſendeth. Though there be not a ſuperiority and inferiority, one to command, and another to be ſubject: Yet notwithſtanding there is an order amongſt them, and the order is this; the Father is, as the Schoolmens Expreſſion frequently is, <hi>Fons Deitatis,</hi> the Fountain of the Godhead; becauſe the Son though he doth partake of the ſame Divine Nature and Eſſence with him, and is every way God with him, yet he hath the Sonſhip or Divine Perſon communicated unto him by God the Father. So the third Perſon hath a divine Nature and Eſſence communicated unto him by a joynt ſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as they expreſs it) or by way of Proceſſion he hath it joyntly from the Father and the Son. And hence it is, that you never find in Scripture that the Father is ſaid to be ſent either by the Son, or by the Holy Ghoſt: But you find concerning both the Son and the Holy Spirit; ſometimes the Son is ſaid to be ſent into the World by the Father; and ſo the Spirit is ſaid to be ſent. This therefore ſheweth indeed the Plurality of Perſons in the Divine Eſſence; and ſo likewiſe the order of ſubſiſtence between them, that there is one as it were before, who hath a priority of order, though not of excellency, or dignity, nor of greatneſs, nor any ſuch thing. And then again, that (which I ſuppoſe) is the principle thing meant by it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Phraſe of ſending, is, that the work, mode, or manner of working which is proper for the Holy Ghoſt; that this is to be performed by him according to the order that we lately ſhewed; Firſt, the Father, then the Son, then the Holy Ghoſt; So that now every one of theſe, though as indeed they have one and the ſame Eſſence and Nature; ſo they alwaies joyn in one and the ſame operation and working <hi>ad extra</hi> (without:) yet notwithſtanding they have every one of them a peculiar and an appropriate and diſtinct manner of working anſwerable to that order wherein they ſubſiſt among themſelves. As for example, The Father beginneth the work which is proper for the Original Author of the Work; and then the Son, he doth ſomething, but in a mediate kind of way, between the beginning, and conſummation or finiſhing of it; and the Holy Ghoſt according to his place in his order being the third and laſt, He worketh after the manner of him that perfecteth, or finiſheth, or conſummates the work. The Father he hath laid the Counſel and Platform of Salvation for men: The Son he hath carried on the work, ſo far as to make the attonement for them: And yet there remaineth ſomething to be done for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World and that is the reducing and bringing men to believe in this Saviour, and to accept of that Attonement which he hath made for them; and this being the conſummating work about the ſalvation
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:95016:124"/>of the World; although the Father and the Son both have a hand in it, and it is doubtleſs their work as well as his; yet the manner of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of it, concluding wiſe, this is appropriate unto the Holy Spirit. And now, becauſe his work importeth ſuch a thing as this is, therefore he is ſaid to be ſent ſometimes by the Father, ſometimes by the Son. And yet the ſame ſending (as I ſaid before) doth not imply (as the Argument would have it) as if he changed his place, becauſe he is ſaid to be ſent from heaven, as if he were not reſident and preſent there ſtill: But he is ſaid to come from Heaven, to ſhew that the work which he doth accompliſh and bring to paſs from day to day is a divine work. And it is the manner of the Hebrew Dialect and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to ſay, that that is ſpoken from heaven, or revealed from Heaven, which is done with a high hand, and in a wonderful and more than ordinary manner: As when there is the unbared Arm of God, then the work is ſaid to be done from Heaven. The Holy Ghoſt, when he was ſent down upon the Apoſtles, was as much in heaven as before. So much for anſwer to this Argument, we will, God willing, be briefer in the reſt.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Argument, <hi>He that is the gift of God, is not God;</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> 
                  <hi>the Holy Ghoſt is the gift of God, therefore he is not God.</hi> The ſum and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Argument being contracted is this; The Holy Ghoſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be God becauſe he is given; God being himſelf the giver of all things, and ſo not capable of being given: and a gift, or that which is given, being at the diſpoſal of him that giveth: which is unworthy to conceive of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſhould be at the diſpoſal of another. Theſe three Propoſitions laid before us in this Argument (which are Pillars and ſupporters of it) are all weak and unſound: As firſt, <hi>That he that is the gift of God is not God,</hi> or cannot be God. Secondly, <hi>That he that is the gift of God cannot be the giver of all things.</hi> Thirdly (and laſtly) <hi>That a gift is in the power and at the diſpoſal of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>To the firſt of theſe, God being <hi>ſui Juris,</hi> at the abſolute diſpoſal of himſelf (for who ſhall deny him this liberty) may give himſelf unto whom he pleaſeth; ſo that God may be both the Gift, and the Giver: As when the Husband or Bridegroom giveth himſelf to his Bride, he is both Gift and Giver. And thus Chriſt gave himſelf to his <hi>Church;</hi> in reſpect of which Act of Donation he is both the Giver and the Gift. And the truth is that God in giving his Spirit unto us (yea, though we ſhould grant the Adverſary his blaſphemous Suppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Spirit is not truly God) may yet be ſaid to give himſelf unto us; how much more when we (according to the Scriptures, which teach us that the Spirit of the Lord, and the Lord the Spirit are all one, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.11.) do believe this Spirit is God, and conſequently giveth himſelf? For what is it for God to give himſelf unto men, but by a free and voluntary
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95016:125"/>diſpoſing himſelf by Covenant or Promiſe to become theirs? Did he not eſtabliſh his Covenant between himſelf and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his ſeed <hi>after him for an everlaſting Covenant to be a God unto him, and to his ſeed after him, Gen.</hi> 17.7. And ſo afterwards unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> (this Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>) did he not ſay by the mouth of <hi>David, Hear oh my People,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am God, even thy God? Pſal.</hi> 50.7. What is that which is given us more than ours? Or what can it be more? So that the firſt Propoſition men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is notoriouſly untrue. <hi>He that is the gift of God is not God,</hi> or cannot be God.</p>
               <p>From the errour of this Propoſition thus evicted (as you have heard) the weakneſs of the ſecond fully appeareth; many words I ſhall not need for confutation of it. The Propoſition was this, <hi>He that is the gift of God, is not, cannot be the giver of all things.</hi> If God be the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of all things (which our Adverſary with the Scriptures granteth and affirmeth) and withal be his own gift; It is a clear caſe, that he that is the gift of God, may be, yea, and is the giver of all things. And concerning the Spirit of God it is expreſly ſaid, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11.) <hi>But all theſe things worketh one and the ſelf ſame Spirit, dividing to every man ſeverally as he will:</hi> theſe words, <hi>as he will,</hi> clearly prove, that thoſe Adminiſtrations and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt there ſpoken of, are not only diſtributed and given immediately by him, but that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, at full liberty of and from himſelf to order and make this diſtribution as he pleaſeth; which is a Character, not of a derived and commiſſionated power, but of that which is ſoveraign and abſolute, which in this caſe muſt needs be divine and appropriate unto God; for it is not only ſaid that he worketh all theſe things, and giveth all theſe gifts, but that he giveth and maketh diſtribution even as himſelf pleaſeth. Certainly, there was no Commiſſion ſo large as this ever given out by God for any Creature whatſoever, to do by the great things of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſuch as concern the Salvation of men, to diſpoſe and diſtribute of them to whom, and where, and to what degree he pleaſeth. And accordingly, he that in the place laſt cited is termed, <hi>the Spirit, but all theſe things worketh one and the ſelf ſame Spirit;</hi> He is in the ſixth verſe expreſly ſaid to be God. And <hi>there are diverſities of operations, but it is the ſame God that worketh all in all;</hi> therefore certainly the Spirit of God and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf they are one and the ſame; theſe things duly conſidered, they are impregnably expreſs for the proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>For the third (and laſt) Propoſition of the three ſpecified, viz. <hi>That a gift is in the power, and at the diſpoſal of another;</hi> neither is this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and univerſally true. For God (as we have proved) is a gift, <hi>viz.</hi> of his own giving, and yet is not hereby proved to be at the diſpoſal of another, but only and ſolely of himſelf; ſo that this Argument is cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie and looſe all over. As for that which he adds (towards the cloſe of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95016:125"/>it) it is altogether as inconſiderable as the reſt, <hi>viz. That if the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt be given unto certain men, then he was not Perſonally with them before, and conſequently cannot be God, by the conceſſion of his Adverſaries themſelves, who deny not that God is alwaies perſonally preſent with all alike.</hi> For the Holy Ghoſt is noted to be given unto ſome certain men in reſpect not ſimply of his <hi>Perſonal preſence</hi> with them, but in reſpect of the fruition and enjoyment of his Perſonal preſence, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ſuch a preſence of his Perſon with them which ſheddeth or poureth out the love of God abroad in their hearts [<hi>i. e.</hi> perſwades men effectually, and with power to believe the love of God towards them:] ſtirs up many holy thoughts and motions in them from time to time. We do acknowledge (indeed) ſuch a perſonal preſence of his with all men alike, which produceth the ſame effects in, and about, and with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto all men, <hi>viz.</hi> their ſuſtentation or continuation of their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: but where he worketh variouſly, or differently we hold a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portional difference of his perſonal preſence with men; ſo that our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary is quite beſides his buſineſs at this turn alſo.</p>
               <p>His Eighth Argument appears in the World with this face, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> 
                  <hi>He that changeth place is not God, the Holy Spirit changeth place, therefore he is not God.</hi> To prove this he ſendeth us to the third of <hi>Luke,</hi> where it is ſaid, that the Holy Ghoſt deſcended like a Dove upon Chriſt at the time of his Baptiſm; From this motion or deſcending aſcribed unto the Holy Ghoſt he would needs infer and conclude, that certainly, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt cannot be God. And why? Becauſe (ſaith he) God cannot change his place by reaſon of his Immenſity, which the Adverſaries themſelves do hold (though the truth is, he himſelf doth not hold it.) Now, who can be ſaid to change and alter his place (ſaith he) ſuch a perſon, whoever he be, or ſuch a thing cannot be God. The Breviate of his Argument cometh only to this: That the Holy Ghoſt changeth his place (I ſuppoſe he would have ſaid, that he is capable of changing his place) and therefore cannot be God; becauſe changing of place is repugnant to the Omnipreſence of God, which is God himſelf. To this therefore we briefly reply.</p>
               <p>That the Holy Ghoſt changeth not his place, nor is capable of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it: nor doth his proof from <hi>Luke</hi> 3.21, 22. hold out with his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>For the deſcending of the Holy Ghoſt, upon Chriſt in a bodily ſhape like a Dove,</hi> doth no waies prove any local motion, or ſhifting of place by the Holy Ghoſt; but only the Doves changing place, by the viſible ſymbole whereof the Holy Ghoſt gave Teſtimony unto Chriſt, or ſealed him for the great Office of Mediatorſhip, which he was now ready to enter upon; even as God the Father gave teſtimony unto him of being his beloved Son, by a voice from Heaven. But whereas he ſaith, that (in the place cited) <hi>We have the Holy Spirit in a bodily ſhape deſcending from heaven,</hi> which is <hi>termi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> a quo;</hi> he affirms that which is not.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:95016:126"/>Here is no mention made of the Holy Ghoſt's deſcending <hi>from heaven</hi> in a bodily ſhape; but only of the Holy Ghoſt deſcending upon Chriſt in a bodily ſhape, like unto a Dove, without any <hi>terminus a quo</hi> at all, of which he ſpeaketh. It is indeed ſaid, concerning the voice that was now heard, that this came from Heaven: but as this Phraſe of <hi>coming from heaven,</hi> ſpoken of the voice, doth not ſuppoſe the voice was firſt in the Heaven, and then by a change of place came ſo near the earth as where it was heard, but only as if he that ſpake it had been in the air above thoſe who heard it: In like manner, if it had been ſaid, that the Holy Ghoſt had <hi>deſcended from heaven</hi> in the viſible ſhape of a Dove, it would not have implied that therefore the Holy Ghoſt was in heaven before, and now by a local motion or remove came unto Chriſt; but only that the Dove in which he is ſaid to have deſcended, came for ſome ſpace down through the air. And as touching the Metaphor of the Holy Ghoſt <hi>deſcending,</hi> it imports nothing but what the Scriptures very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpeak concerning God himſelf; expreſſing this variation, or change of diſpenſation, or acting, by ſuch Phraſes which in the Letter of them import change of place: Nor do thoſe Texts of Scripture, which he citeth to prove, that it was not God himſelf, but an Angel who is ſaid (<hi>Gen.</hi> 18.21.) to have gone down either <hi>diviſim,</hi> or <hi>conjunctim,</hi> prove any ſuch thing. As for the reſt of thoſe places, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.53. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13. theſe have not ſo much as a colour of ſuch proof: nor indeed have theſe Texts themſelves (which are likelieſt to ſerve his turn of all other) <hi>Acts</hi> 7.30, 35, 38. much more. For what? though he that appeared in the Buſh unto <hi>Moſes</hi> be termed ſometimes an Angel, or the Angel of the Lord: or otherwiſe the Lord God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Yet,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Neither followeth it, that therefore he was a created Angel, as becauſe Angels are ſometimes termed men, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.22. (beſides other places without number) it doth not follow that therefore they were natural and true men; But only that they then appeared in the ſhapes of men, they were men by diſpenſation, and for a time only. Neither,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Doth it follow, That in caſe it be granted, that an Angel in one place is therefore termed <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Lord, or God, becauſe he ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaines the Perſon, or ſpeaks in the name of God; that therefore where any thing is attributed unto God, as ſpoken in the name of God, it muſt needs be meant of an Angel, theſe are wild kind of Inferences or Proofs. By the way, I do not conceive that any Angel, properly ſo called, <hi>i.e.</hi> any created Angel, ever ſtiled himſelf by the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> or God: but that when he that thus ſtileth himſelf is any where called an <hi>Angel,</hi> it is meant of that increated Angel who is called <hi>Angelus foederis,</hi> the Angel of the Covenant; and in reſpect of his frequent: appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances unto men, and tranſactings of things aftter the manner of Angels,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95016:126"/>may properly enough be termed the Angel of the Lord. But ſuppoſe we ſhould caſt in that Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.21. into the Treaſury of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries demands, and grant that the Lord, who then ſaid that he would <hi>go down,</hi> ſignifies a created Angel, and not <hi>Jehovah</hi> himſelf, yet this would not much enrich him. For there are other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, where local motion, and change of place is (upon the account mentioned) aſcribed unto God, ſee 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.15. <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.16. <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.16. &amp; 8.3. (and poſſibly in many other places beſides all theſe.) God is ſaid to <hi>return,</hi> which as plainly imports local motion, as deſcending doth. Yea, who knows not that <hi>coming,</hi> and coming forth, coming out of his place, are frequently attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unth God? ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.21. <hi>Mic.</hi> 1.3. (where the very expreſſion, now contended about, <hi>viz.</hi> deſcending, or <hi>coming down</hi>) is expreſly affirmed of God; as it is likewiſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.20. <hi>Num.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18 9. And who knoweth how oft beſides? So that from the Holy Ghoſt's <hi>deſcending;</hi> an Argument levied againſt his Godhead is but a vapour or ſmoak.</p>
               <p>His Ninth Argument is not made of much better materials, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> however the form and matter of it together produceth this. <hi>He that prayeth unto Chriſt to come to Judgment, is not God; the Holy Spirit doth ſo,</hi> Ergo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Fabrick of this Argument is built (as you may ſee) upon this foundation: that the Spirit of God cannot be God, becauſe (ſaith he) that he prayeth unto Chriſt to come to Judgment, which he proveth from <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17.</p>
               <p>I reply, That Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. doth no way prove, that the Holy Ghoſt prayeth unto Chriſt to come to Judgment, ſo that this is an errour in the foundation. For firſt, Though it be here ſaid, <hi>And the Spirit and the Bride ſay come;</hi> yet it is not ſaid that the Holy Ghoſt, or the Holy Spirit (ſo called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) and the bride ſay come. It is the ſenſe of ſome learned men, that by the Spirit in this place is not meant the Holy Ghoſt, but the Angel or Spirit which Chriſt is ſaid (<hi>Chap.</hi> 1.1.) to have ſent, to ſignifie this Revelation unto <hi>John,</hi> and who converſed with him all along hitherto. Angels (we know) are of a ſpiritual nature, and frequently in Scriptures termed Spirits. Now to reaſon either <hi>a genere,</hi> or <hi>a ſpecie ad individuum,</hi> from a general to a particular affirmatively is an Argument fitter for a child than for a man: As thus, It was a man that did ſuch or ſuch a thing, therefore it was <hi>William</hi> or <hi>Thomas</hi> that did it; ſuch a reaſoning as this is that before us; <hi>The Spirit ſaith come,</hi> therefore ſuch or ſuch a Spirit by name as the holieſt Spirit of all ſaith come. But grant we the Adverſary that which his Argument demands, that by the Spirit here is meant the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Yet Secondly, It is not neceſſary to conceive, that the Holy Ghoſt ſpake thus; (<hi>ſaith</hi> unto Chriſt <hi>come</hi>) as being without the <hi>Bride,</hi> but as ſpeaking in and by the Bride: Nay, it cannot reaſonably be conceived
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95016:127"/>otherwiſe. For if the Holy Ghoſt, ſeparated from and without the Bride, ſhall ſay come, then the <hi>Bride</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to ſay <hi>come</hi> of her ſelf, and without the preſence and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt: In which caſe were ſhe able to conceive ſuch a Prayer as this of her ſelf, (which yet ſhe is not;) yet would it not be acceptable unto God; no Prayer being accepted with him but that which is prayed in, or by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Though here be two Agents, or two Speakers (I beſeech you mind it) mentioned, the Spirit and the Bride, yet here is but one Action or ſpeaking aſſerted to them both: here is but one <hi>Come, And the Spirit and the Bride ſay come;</hi> it is not, and the Spirit ſaith come, and again, the <hi>Bride ſaith come:</hi> No, but the Spirit and the Bride together make one lip, as it were between them, and together they ſay, as it were with one voice, <hi>come.</hi> So that this paſſage or expreſſion wherein the Spirit of God and the Spouſe are made joynt Agents or joynt Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in one and the ſame Action or Speech, perfectly agreeth with that Notion which runs throughout the Scriptures from place to place, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto which God and the Creature are made Co-workers, or joynt Agents, in all that the Creature doth worthily and according to the will of God; in which reſpect alſo the Act produced between them, is ſometimes aſcribed to the one, and otherwhile to the other. Many Inſtances hereof we have heretofore given you from the Scriptures: if you pleaſe let us touch one inſtead of many at preſent in this kind (not formerly obſerved) and which hath a ſpecial affinity with the place in hand, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. The Apoſtles, Elders, and Brethren aſſembled at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> write thus (among other things) to the Church of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: <hi>For it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and unto us, to lay no other,</hi> &amp;c. Here the Apoſtles, and the reſt with them, aſcribe that Act of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion unto themſelves as well as unto the Holy Ghoſt (though to the Holy Ghoſt in the firſt place) which was raiſed in them by the aſſiſtance and motion of the Holy Ghoſt, though not without the joynt concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their Underſtandings and Wills alſo; the meaning is not, that the things ſpoken of ſeemed good unto the Apoſtles, and the reſt, apart from the Holy Ghoſt, or without the dictating of the Notion or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion by the Holy Ghoſt, nor again, that it ſeemed good unto the Holy Ghoſt ſimply conſidered or apart, and extrinſical unto them; For how then could they have told them that it ſeemed good unto the Holy Ghoſt and them? <hi>But it ſeemed good unto the Holy Ghoſt, and us;</hi> the meaning is, that the Holy Ghoſt did enlighten and reveal the thing unto them, and gave them directions, and put them upon it to ſend this Counſel unto the Gentiles: Namely, to impoſe upon them by way of burthen and charge no other thing, but that they abſtain from ſuch and ſuch things; ſo that here the Holy Ghoſt and the Apoſtles are joyned together in the ſame Act of apprehenſion; ſo in the place (in hand) the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95016:127"/>Spirit and the Bride they make one and the ſame voice together; the Spirit he dictates, and the Bride ſhe uttereth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuppoſe it had been ſo expreſſed, <hi>And the Spirit ſaith come, and the Bride ſaith come:</hi> That there had been two diſtinct Actions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; the one aſcribed unto the Holy Ghoſt; the other unto the Bride or Church of Chriſt; yet neither would it have followed from hence, that therefore the Holy Ghoſt had prayed unto Chriſt to come to Judgment. When a Judge preſcribes or dictates the form of an Oath to be taken by a Jury, or any Perſon thereof, he doth not ſwear or take an Oath; though the other that ſpeaketh the ſame words after him doth formally and properly ſwear: In like manner, the Holy Ghoſt may teach the Bride what ſhe ſhould ſay, and put words into her mouth, and ſay thus within the Conſcience and Soul of the Church, <hi>Come Lord Jeſus come quickly.</hi> Now, though the Holy Ghoſt ſpake theſe words, and dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the Bride what ſhe ſhould ſay and pray, it doth not follow, that therefore he ſhould pray himſelf. When Chriſt taught his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to pray, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. it doth not follow, that therefore he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did pray; but he did put words into the mouths of his Diſciples, which when they came to utter, would be a Prayer properly and truly ſo called, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mr <hi>Brightman</hi> underſtandeth the place thus.</p>
               <p>The Tenth Argument levied againſt the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt is this. <hi>He in whom men have not believed,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> 
                  <hi>and yet have been Diſciples and Believers, is not God; Men have not believed in the Holy Spirit, and yet have been ſo</hi> (viz. <hi>Diſciples, Believers:</hi>) <hi>Ergo.</hi> The ſum and ſubſtance of this Argument (which ſpreads much Paper in the Author's words) is this; becauſe we read in the Scriptures of ſome called Diſciples, who yet did not believe in the Holy Ghoſt: Nor had ſo much as heard or known whether there were any Holy Ghoſt or no; and withal that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did not take any occaſion thereupon to declare the Holy Ghoſt to be God: Therefore certainly he is not God.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer (and affirm by the way) that from the Crown of the head unto the ſole of the Foot of this Argument there is no ſound part in it. For firſt,</p>
               <p>The Major Propoſition, which is the head of this Argument, <hi>He in whom men have not believed, and yet have been Diſciples and Believers, is not God:</hi> This Propoſition, I ſay, is unſound, becauſe it is ambiguous, and ſo is apt to abuſe mens Judgments, and deceive them, and not to inſtruct them. For however there is a ſenſe wherein it is good, and will hold: yet there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſenſe which lieth more obnoxious to mens apprehenſions, which is not true. For he may be God, the word God taken Perſonally, on whom though men have not believed, <hi>viz.</hi> Explicitely, yet they may be Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Believers: Though it be true alſo on the other hand, that he that believeth not in God Eſſentially taken cannot be a Diſciple, or a Believer. He that believeth not that there is one God cannot be a Diſciple, or true
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95016:128"/>Believer as the caſe may be: But he that believes not the diſtinct manner of the ſubſiſtence of this one God, <hi>viz.</hi> that he ſubſiſts in three (which we call Perſons:) Or that doth not believe, eſpecially explicitely, and by name, and under relation of any of all the three; ſuch an one may notwithſtanding be a Diſciple, and Believer in the Scripture ſenſe. I would be loath to pronounce the hard Sentence of non-Diſciple, or non-Believer, againſt all thoſe that profeſſedly deny the Godhead of Chriſt, or of the Holy Ghoſt (though there are many that are not at all tender in doing it:) becauſe though explicitely and in terms they deny him, yet believing there is one God, and this one God being Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, they do implicitely, virtually, and conſtructively own and acknowledge them. As he that carries a Box ſealed up about him, wherein he thinketh there is but one Jewel, he knoweth of no more; yet in caſe there be three more, he carrieth them all by carrying the Box or Caſe wherein they are contained: In like manner, he that believeth one God, doth virtually believe in the Three Perſons; though I would not by this extenuate the greatneſs of the ſin, and dangerouſneſs of the error of thoſe who in words profeſs againſt the Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt (and ſo of Chriſt) though implicitely, and by way of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they acknowledge it. The ancient Jews (ſuch I mean who were <hi>Abraham's</hi> Seed) were true Diſciples and Believers; yet did not they, at leaſt all of them, explicitely believe Chriſt to have been, or that he was the Son of God; but the Propoſition we are now upon is not (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) worthy the labour already beſtowed upon the examination of it, <hi>Vanitate ſuâ tranſlucet,</hi> A man may ſee through it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That which is the Baſis and main Foundation of the whole diſcourſe of the Argument is an abſolute miſtake and miſapprehenſion. For the meaning of the words ſpoken by thoſe who are called Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.2. <hi>We have not ſo much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghoſt,</hi> is not, that they had never heard of the name, or ſimple being of the Holy Ghoſt (we ſhall manifeſt the contrary hereunto preſently) but that they had not as yet heard whether the Holy Ghoſt was in <hi>actu ſecundo</hi> (as the School-men ſpeak;) <hi>i.e.</hi> whether he was abroad again in the World, as formerly he was in the daies of their Fore-fathers and Prophets. This to be the true and plain meaning of the words ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by ſeveral conſiderations: Firſt, The Verb Subſtantive here uſed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which properly ſignifies the ſimple and abſolute being or exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of a thing, is oft uſed in the Scriptures for the being of a thing in Act, Exerciſe, or Manifeſtation; in this ſenſe it is uſed more than once by our Saviour himſelf. The Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> uſeth it concerning the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39. <hi>This he ſpake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive, for the Holy Ghoſt was not yet,</hi> [the word <hi>given,</hi> inſerted in our Engliſh Tranſlation, is not in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal] <hi>the Holy Ghoſt was not yet, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified;</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:95016:128"/>was not <hi>yet, i.e.</hi> was not yet abroad in the World amongſt Believers, in the diſcovery of himſelf by thoſe miraculous and extraordinary gifts, which afterwards he conferred upon many; ſo when theſe Diſciples the Argument ſpeaketh of ſaid, <hi>that they had not ſo much as heard</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>whether the Holy Ghoſt be,</hi> The meaning is, that they had not heard whether he had been yet given or no; [<hi>viz.</hi> upon a new account, the ancient account, upon which, as they conceived, He was formerly given, being expired and out of date long ſince.] Our Engliſh Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors might as well have inſerted the word <hi>given</hi> in this place as in that of <hi>John</hi> mentioned; and then the Clauſe would have run thus, <hi>We have not ſo much as heard whether the Holy Ghoſt be given.</hi> We have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given you many inſtances from the Scriptures of ſuch an Adjective ſenſe of the Verb Subſtantive <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as that is now contended for, <hi>viz.</hi> From <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.45. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13, &amp;c. This ſenſe (in the ſecond place) is confirmed againſt that given, or ſuppoſed by our Adverſaries in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument before us, from hence, becauſe theſe Diſciples had certainly <hi>heard</hi> of the being of the Holy Ghoſt, or Holy Spirit. For firſt, Being <hi>Jews</hi> (which appears by their having been baptized by <hi>John's,</hi> or ſome of his Diſciples Baptiſm in thoſe daies, not having been carried out amongſt the Gentiles, and after it was come abroad unto other Gentiles, they in <hi>Aſia</hi> where <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſtood were for a time denied it, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.6.) being <hi>Jews</hi> (I ſay) they could not but have heard of the being of the Holy Ghoſt, or of the Spirit of God, mention hereof being ſo plainly and frequently made in the Scriptures. I need not (I ſuppoſe) to cite pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for this, but whether they were <hi>Jews</hi> or Gentiles having been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> it cannot be imagined, but that they had heard of the being of the Holy Ghoſt: For <hi>John,</hi> when he baptized men with water, admoniſhed them to believe on him (<hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11.) that ſhould come after him, who, he told them, <hi>ſhould baptize them with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire.</hi> And there is little queſtion to be made, but that <hi>John's</hi> Diſciples taught the ſame Doctrine in this Point with their Maſter.</p>
               <p>Again thirdly, That ſenſe of the words, which we have given, makes the anſwer of the Diſciples every whit as congruous and pertinent to <hi>Paul's</hi> queſtion put to them, if not more than that ſenſe which the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ſuppoſeth; <hi>Paul ſaid unto them,</hi> or demanded of them, <hi>have ye received the Holy Ghoſt ſince ye believed?</hi> They anſwer him (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſenſe we plead) <hi>We have not ſo much as heard whether there be</hi> any receiving of him, or no, or whether any other Believers have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him. And fourthly (and laſtly for this) there is this reaſon why theſe Diſciples being <hi>Jews</hi> (as we argued) might probably ſay or mean than they had not ſo much as heard whether the Holy Ghoſt were now abroad in the World, or no; becauſe, from the time of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who miſerably afflicted and waſted their Church and State, the Jews
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:95016:129"/>were wont greatly to mourn and lament, as if, together with their laſt Prophets, who Propheſied in <hi>Ezra's</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> times, under, and a while after the building of their ſecond Temple, they were wont (I ſay) to mourn (as the generality of them, or at leaſt ſome of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them do at this day) as if with thoſe their Prophets the Holy Ghoſt had forſaken them, and refuſed to manifeſt his preſence amongſt them any more, according to that in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74 9. <hi>We ſee not our ſigns, there is no more any Prophet; neither is there any amongſt us that knoweth how long.</hi> According to this Notion the Diſciples, we are now ſpeaking of, might ſay to <hi>Paul,</hi> that they had not ſo much as heard the leaſt inkling of thoſe bleſſed tidings that the Holy Ghoſt was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto the World. But then again,</p>
               <p>Thirdly (as to the Argument it ſelf) Whereas the Author of it ſaith, That <hi>to take the Holy Spirit, not for his Perſon, but for his Gifts, is to ſpeak without example;</hi> he moſt palpably contradicts himſelf, within two or three lines after, where he grants that <hi>Paul's</hi> queſtion to them, <hi>Whether they had received the Holy Ghoſt or no,</hi> might be underſtood of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) Becauſe I would not ſtand any longer upon this Argument, whereas he would infer, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould not be God, from hence, that the Apoſtle, upon the occaſion here offered, did not declare him to be ſo, whereas upon a leſſer occaſion he inſtructed the Heathen at <hi>Athens</hi> in the nature of the true God. We reply.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is not unreaſonable to demand of him who thus reaſoneth, What Oracle he conſults with, which informs him that <hi>Paul</hi> did not do that which he thinketh fit he ſhould have done, in caſe the Holy Ghoſt be God, <hi>viz.</hi> Inform theſe Diſciples accordingly? And certain I am, here is not the leaſt ground adminiſtred unto him to judge the contrary. It is ſaid in the progreſs of the ſtory, that for three Months together publickly, and afterwards for two years together more privately, he argued and diſputed things appertaining to the Kingdom of God. It is an old rule and a true, that <hi>Argumentum ab Authoritate ductum negativâ non valet:</hi> That Arguments drawn from Authority negatively have no force nor value in them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether the Apoſtle formally, <hi>Totidens verbis,</hi> taught the Diſciples that the Holy Ghoſt was God or no; certainly, he did that which was as good, or better for them than ſuch a Doctrine formally delivered would have been; yea, and haply that which being interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amounted to as much, as a declaring of him to have been God, and ſo may be ſaid eminently, though not formally to have declared him to be God; For by laying his hands upon them, he obtained the gift of the Holy Ghoſt for them, by whom they were miraculouſly acted, ſpeaking with ſtrange Tongues, and Propheſying; which
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95016:129"/>motions and actings of the Holy Ghoſt, at one and the ſame time in them all, with the like in other Chriſtians up and down the World, might be to them a convincing Argument of his Godhead; though it be not ſuch unto him who oppoſeth in the queſtion in hand. However that which the Apoſtle did for theſe Diſciples in procuring the Holy Ghoſt to be given them, argueth every whit as much, or more care and zeal for their ſpiritual accommodation, as his preaching that God to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> whom they ignorantly worſhipped, did towards theirs; So that this Act of the Apoſtle was very impertinently inſiſted upon for ſuch a purpoſe as that pleaded here. This for reply to this Argument.</p>
               <p>Concerning his Eleventh Argument, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> the heart thereof is already bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in our anſwers to the fourth and fifth Arguments, where we ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and proved, how the Holy Ghoſt might both hear from another, and receive from another without any prejudice or impeachment of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: Nevertheleſs let us give this Argument alſo the hearing, and if there be any farther ſtrain of reaſon beyond what was preſented in the former Arguments, we will weigh it in the balance of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary.</p>
               <p>This eleventh Argument then proceedeth thus; <hi>He that hath any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding diſtinct from God, is not God; the holy Spirit hath an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding diſtinct from God,</hi> Ergo, &amp;c. The two paſſages of Scripture which are the ſtrength and ſinews of this Argument, <hi>viz. Joh.</hi> 16.13, 14, 15. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.26. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 28. We have formerly had in conſideration, and found nothing there to ſupport that cauſe for which they were produced; and if there was nothing in them then for ſuch a purpoſe, certainly there is nothing ſince added unto them; nor is there the leaſt jot or title in either of theſe places that the Holy Ghoſt heareth from God that, whereof he was ignorant before. In what ſenſe he is ſaid not <hi>to ſpeak of himſelf,</hi> to take of the things of Chriſt to reveal them unto men, hath been formerly opened; and whatever there appears in the ſaid paſſages to prove, that the underſtanding or learning of the Holy Ghoſt is diſtinct from the underſtanding of God teaching, relates only unto the humane underſtanding of Chriſt, not of the Holy Ghoſt. But of theſe things formerly.</p>
               <p>Concerning that new place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. From whence he ſeeks to evince the underſtanding of the Holy Ghoſt to be another diſtinct from the underſtanding of God, becauſe it is here ſaid, that <hi>the Spirit ſearcheth all things, even the deep things of God;</hi> and the ſame under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding cannot be conceived, or ſaid to ſearch it ſelf, or its own deep things. We reply briefly and plainly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Spirit is ſaid <hi>to ſearch the deep things of God,</hi> becauſe he is able to guide or lead the underſtandings of men in a rational and diſcourſive way into the knowledge or diſcerning of the deep things of God. It being a method proper and natural unto this kind of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95016:130"/>(I mean, the underſtanding of men) by certain ſteps and degrees to be led on to the knowledge of things that be more myſterious and remote. It is a thing familiar and frequent in Scripture, to aſcribe an Action as well unto that which aſſiſts, qualifies, or enables unto it; whether it be perſon, or thing, as unto the immediate and Proper Agent himſelf, when the Action is ſuch that the proper Agent who doth it could not have done it without ſuch an aſſiſtance; yea, ſometimes (which is yet more) in ſuch caſe as we ſpeak of, the Action is denied to be done by the Agent, who yet properly doth it, and is attributed unto that whether perſon, or thing, which only aſſiſteth or enableth to it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.20. <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.11.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour encourageth his Diſciples not to be troubled when they ſhould be called before Rulers for his ſake; <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is not you that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father that ſpeaketh in you.</hi> Now we know it was not the Holy Ghoſt that uttered theſe words; but becauſe the Apoſtles had not wiſdom enough of themſelves to make ſuch Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies without the aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt; here is nothing aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the proper or immediate Agents the Apoſtles themſelves, but it is aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt. And ſo again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>But I labour more abundantly than they all</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>yet not I, but the grace of God which is in me.</hi> But how doth the grace of God labour more than they All? Not properly, for it is not capable of ſpeaking or journeying: But becauſe it did enable and ſtrengthen <hi>Paul,</hi> and raiſed his ſpirit, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his heart and underſtanding to labour and fill the World with the knowledge of the Goſpel, therefore he ſaith he laboured more abundantly than they all. The like Expreſſion you have <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter end, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſs I live: yet not I, but Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. It was <hi>Paul</hi> certainly that lived; and it is true likewiſe, that the life he ſpeaketh of Chriſt litterally or properly did not live in him: But it was Chriſt, the knowledge of whom, and the belief of whom was <hi>Paul's</hi> life; becauſe that filled him with ſo much peace, and comfort, and joy, which is that he meaneth by life. Therefore that life which he lived he diſclaimeth it as to himſelf, and aſcribeth it unto him who did enable him thus to do. Like inſtances you have heard, where that which is acted and done is aſcribed not to the proper or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Agent, but to that which qualifieth or enableth for the doing of it. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4, 7. <hi>Charity ſuffereth long,</hi> &amp;c. not that Charity doth this or that, for the truth is, that Charity doth none of theſe things: It is not the proper or immediate Agent of theſe actions; but only it doth diſpoſe, enable, and encline the hearts of men and women to do them. And ſo <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.20. is of a like character or form of ſpeech, <hi>The wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſs of God:</hi> The meaning is, that the wrath of man doth hinder or indiſpoſe men for acting that which is agreeable unto the righteous, holy, and juſt Commands of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95016:130"/>God. Men by reaſon of their wrath, if they be ſurprized by it, are not in any good capacity to do the will or to work the righteouſneſs of God. So likewiſe when men work out their Salvation with fear and trembling, God is ſaid <hi>to work in them both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2.13. becauſe he aſſiſts and enables. So in the Scripture before us the Spirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s ſaid <hi>to ſearch the deep things of God,</hi> not becauſe he himſelf reaſons or argues himſelf into the knowledge of theſe things; But becauſe he aſſiſts, guides, and leads the minds and underſtandings of men into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe things. This to be the clear and expreſs ſenſe of the place is evident from verſe 12. <hi>Now we have received not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi> that by him we might be directed and enabled to know] <hi>the things which are freely given unto us of God.</hi> Which alſo agreeth with that of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. <hi>When he is come he will lead you into all truth;</hi> ſo that there is little queſtion (or rather none at all) but that that is the true ſenſe of the place in hand, which hath been given. I deſire the Rule delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with the ſeveral Inſtances that have been given for the confirmation of it, may be the rather remembred and obſerved, becauſe the anſwer of the next (and laſt Argument) depends upon it. But ſecondly, If the underſtanding of the Spirit were diſtinct from the underſtanding of God, <hi>he could not ſearch the deep things of God,</hi> becauſe the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of God is infinite; and how can a finite underſtanding reach or comprehend that which is infinite? Even as the things of a man, or of the underſtanding of a man, no underſtanding or faculty that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it, or inferiour to it, is able to dive into or comprehend.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The ſenſe given muſt needs be the true meaning of the place, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Spirit is therefore ſaid to <hi>ſearch the deep things of God;</hi> becauſe he enableth men to ſearch ſo far as is neceſſary for them to know; becauſe himſelf by his own Act, in reference to himſelf, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to <hi>ſearch the things of God,</hi> whether deep, or other; becauſe ſearching properly implieth ſtudy, or labour, and diligence of enquiry; and this ſuppoſeth a want of knowledge of the things ſearched after un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till by ſearching they are found out; but neither of theſe are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Spirit of God as is evident. For firſt, it is not proper to the Spirit to ſearch, and ſtudy, and to come unto the knowledge of things by diligence and enquiry; neither is it any way meet to be ſpoken of the Holy Ghoſt that he is deſtitute, or ignorant of the things of God, and that by labour, diligence, and ſtudy he ſearcheth them out; ſo that this paſſage of Scripture is utterly a ſtranger to the Argument in hand. Some other things are affirmed in the Argument, which being weighed in the balance would be found too light. But enough hath been ſaid for the uncovering of the nakedneſs, and to diſcover the ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of it to perform the device which is imagined.</p>
               <p>The twelfth and laſt Argument, we have to encounter with, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> hath
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:95016:131"/>(upon the matter) received anſwer already; notwithſtanding being the laſt, let us hear what it hath to ſay. <hi>He that hath a will diſtinct in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from that of God, is not God; the Holy Spirit hath a will diſtinct in number from that of God:</hi> Ergo. The ſum of this Argument is drawn up thus: The Holy Ghoſt is ſaid, Firſt, to intercede with God, or to pray unto God for the Saints.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He is ſaid to do it according to the will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. Therefore in reſpect of the latter, He muſt needs have a will diſtinct from the Will of God, and ſo cannot be God: In reſpect of the former, he muſt be inferiour unto God (becauſe he prayeth unto him) and in this reſpect alſo cannot be God. But to this Argument we reply.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That whereas the Spirit is ſaid <hi>to help our infirmities;</hi> which infirmities are mentioned as lying in this, <hi>That we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, viz.</hi> of our ſelves, and by our own ſtrength. If the Holy Ghoſt ſhould pray for us apart by himſelf, he ſhould not at all help our infirmities in this kind: For we ſhould, or might, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main under ſuch Infirmities ſuch Interceſſions for us by the Spirit not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding. If it be ſaid, that the Spirit may intercede for us that our infirmities in this kind may be healed; then it followeth, that if our infirmities ſtill remain, as (queſtionleſs) they do, and will do to our lives end, (and <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf was not exempted in this kind) It followeth (I ſay) if ſo be the interceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt be that thoſe infirmities of the Saints ſhould be healed, in caſe they be not healed, then the Interceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt is not regarded and accepted for us with God, and then what kind of help ſhould we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him? But then,</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Spirit is ſaid <hi>to make interceſſion for us with groans which cannot be uttered.</hi> Now, though we ſhould grant that groaning may in a metaphorical ſenſe, and unproperly be attributed unto the Spirit, yet how any groans or groaning of his ſhould be unutterable unto him who is the Lord of all Language and Speech is not eaſie to conceive.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whereas the Argument inſiſteth ſo rigidly upon theſe words in the end of <hi>ver.</hi> 27. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of God:</hi> As if they argued a diſtinct will of the Spirit from the will of God.</p>
               <p>I reply, that the words do not ſignifie according to the Will of God (here is no word which ſignifieth Will:) But <hi>according unto God,</hi> and they anſwer theſe words by way of Antitheſis in the former verſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>as we ought.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle had there granted that the Saints did not indeed of themſelves know how to pray as they ought: here he tells them for their comfort that the Spirit will enable them to pray as they ought, <hi>i. e.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, according unto God, or the mind or will of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> as they ought, and as it becometh them to pray. And here
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:95016:131"/>is a direct anſwer, relating to thoſe infirmities which our Apoſtle had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly affirmed to be in the Saints.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That the work of the Spirit on the behalf of the Saints, doth not lie in this, to pray for the Saints a part in heaven (which is the ſenſe of the Author of this Argument) is evident from <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. where our Saviour ſaith, that when he ſhould go away, he would <hi>pray the Father, and he will give you another Comforter that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth,</hi> &amp;c. So that the work which the Spirit hath to do for the Saints is not in heaven ſince the Aſcenſion of Chriſt into Heaven; Heaven is not the Stage or Theatre where the Holy Ghoſt acteth and beſtirs himſelf on the behalf of the Saints; but now he is come down upon the earth, and his great buſineſs which he hath to do lieth in the earth, even with the hearts, minds, underſtandings, and wills of men, ſtirring and moving there. But</p>
               <p>Fifthly (and laſtly) Remember the Rule that we delivered unto you in the former Argument, which will fully give you the ſenſe wherein the Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to intercede with groans: we gave you many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when we delivered this for a Rule, that in many places Actions are aſcribed unto him that doth aſſiſt, and direct, and help men in the performance of them, and not unto him that is the formal and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Agent.</p>
               <p>So here the Holy Ghoſt doth intercede with groans, becauſe he doth fill the Saints with his Wiſdom and Power, and ſo putteth them into a poſture to conceive inward groans, and ſecret motions and deſires in the Soul, which the Creature (indeed) is not able to utter, or come to God withal in his lips: the Creature cannot utter it ſelf, when the heart is full of the Spirit of God; yet ſuch perſons are acted beyond their own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and very well may be, becauſe the Spirit is directing, guiding, and ſtrengthening unto this work. And this is the property of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor. To intercede doth not alwaies ſignifie to plead for us, but ſometimes to plead with us againſt any Enemy, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, this word in the rigour of the Grammatical ſignification of it is not alwaies uſed for interceding for another (which he ſeemeth to catch at, as I judge from the Latine word, which ſignifieth to go between two) but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to go in oppoſition to an Enemy, and ſometimes it ſignifieth, to expoſtulate and debate things with another, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. So that all things being conſidered it is a clear caſe, that this Argument is wholly defective. And it may be ſeen further, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. it is expreſly ſaid, that by means of the Spirit we cry <hi>Abba, Father;</hi> meaning, that by the aſſiſtance and impulſe of the Spirit, we are able to call <hi>God Father:</hi> which implieth the whole duty and management of this great ſervice of Prayer and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation on the name of God. And in the laſt place, <hi>Jam.</hi> 16. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prayer of the <hi>righteous man,</hi> we tranſlate it the <hi>effectual Prayer;</hi> but the word properly ſignifieth that which is acted within a
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95016:132"/>perſon by a power which is ſuperiour to that which is natural in it. We call thoſe perſons, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, who are acted by an unclean Spirit; as when any perſon is made to ſpeak a Language which he never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, we uſe to ſay, ſuch a perſon is inſpired, acted, and carried out by a power ſuperiour to his own. And ſo that Prayer which can do ſo much with God; <hi>The effectual, fervent prayer of the Righteous,</hi> it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifieth ſuch a Prayer which is full of the Holy Ghoſt, which is inſpired into man, or whereunto a man is carried out, and thruſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by a Divine Power, greater than his own. So that theſe things conſidered, it is a clear caſe, that the true ſenſe and meaning of the place is only this, That the Spirit of God relieveth our infirmities in Prayer; that when <hi>as we know not how to pray as we ought,</hi> and when the fleſh ſometimes cometh in, and directeth, and leadeth into ſuch a method of Prayer which we ought not; the Spirit now interpoſing, and directing, and leading us to ſuch a method and way, that now we pray according to the mind and will of God.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the buſineſs it ſelf, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> I mean, the Controverſie, I would only ſay this before I leave it, that if you mind it, or ſhall pleaſe to go round about the matters in Controverſie, and weigh both theſe Doctrines; Firſt, that which denieth the Holy Ghoſt to be God: go I ſay round it, and take all the Arguments and grounds which the Maintainers thereof are pleaſed to bring forth, and weigh and conſider their tendencies and operations upon the hearts and conſciences of men, and you ſhall find them altogether barren, and flat, and no waies calculated for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of men: neither is there any thing in it that is any waies apt to quicken the hearts of men to the Service of God comparable to that Doctrine which doth oppoſe it, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt is God, truly God. In this Doctrine, and in the Arguments, by which it is proved, there is ſpirit and life, there is as it were great ſtrength which cometh forth from it, which bears upon the Judgments and Conſciences of men; It rules like a King upon his Throne: Whereas thoſe other Doctrines, <hi>viz.</hi> that deny the Spirit, and ſo likewiſe Chriſt to be God, are but of a dull and flat import, there is no manner of ſpiritual power and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour in them. It may poſſibly be the ſenſe of ſome, that the time wherein we have been arguing of this great Controverſie might have been better ſpent in arguing other things; they ſuppoſe that theſe kind of notions are not ſo affecting unto the hearts of men, neither do they tend unto the eſtabliſhing of them, nor are ſo proper for the building of men up in their moſt holy Faith, nor ſo powerful to excite unto Action. But the truth is (my Brethren) though ſuch diſcourſes as theſe, and the laying out of ſuch things for ſubſtance as theſe are, though they do not ſo much ſtir the heart as ſome other ſubjects may and might have done, yet nevertheleſs theſe have ſomewhat which will make you unmovable in the waies of Chriſt. And if this be but duly caſt up by you, you
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95016:132"/>will find it every way as profitable unto you, it will amount to every whit as great a ſum of comfort and of peace, as thoſe Sermons whoſe property is to quicken and work upon men at preſent.</p>
               <p>For what will it avail you, if you ſhould be carried up into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens one day by a Sermon full of affection, and another day a deceiver cometh and layeth a ſtumbling block in the way, and ſhould make you call in queſtion, and drive you quite off from theſe great Truths of the Godhead of Chriſt, and of the Holy Ghoſt? I am very confident, that few of you that have heard me in this queſtion but know, that there are many young men that are able to puzle you, and to put you to ſuch a ſtand in theſe great Principles of Religion, that you would not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be able to vindicate your ſelves, nor your credit, nor deliver your Judgments from their ſnares and entanglements.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is objected and ſuppoſed by ſome, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> that ſuch Sermons as theſe are ſublime myſteries, and that the ſecrets of the Trinity diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed do not furniſh Chriſtian men and women, Maſters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, with matter for repetition in the Evening of the day to their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. To this I anſwer briefly in a word, That it is to be preſumed that you that have been Profeſſors ſo long (as generally you have been) are able of your ſelves out of your own Treaſure to ſpeak things that are moſt commodious and fitting to be ſpoken unto your Servants, and eſpecially unto your Children, and not alwaies to expect from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſter matters for your private Families. Strong men deſire ſtrong meat, and milk is not nouriſhment for them to make them grow to any conſiderable degree: But for Babes and Sucklings, that are not grown in their ſpiritual ſtature, things (indeed) of a lower nature, and of a more eaſie apprehenſion are meet and very fit. So that there is no reaſon to deſire or expect this; that you ſhould never hear from a publick Miniſter nothing but that which is meet and convenient for you to preach over at home. No: you muſt be provided from your ſelves, and out of your own for ſuch occaſions; otherwiſe you muſt reſolve never to thrive and grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, but alwaies to ſtand at the ſame ſtay. And of how dangerous a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it is, that in this caſe you ſhould have your deſires, <hi>viz.</hi> That from time to time the firſt rudiments only of Religion ſhould ſtill be diſcuſſed in your hearing; do but conſider this one place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1, 2, 3. Therefore <hi>leaving the Principles of the Doctrine of Chriſt, the Doctrine of Baptiſms,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And this will we do if God permit</hi> (What is that?) <hi>Go on to perfection:</hi> That is, carry on your Judgments to the moſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious things of God. But mark now upon what ground it is, that he reſolveth upon this, that this he would do, and deſires them to go along with him: For (ſaith he) <hi>it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightned,</hi> &amp;c. How doth this Motive hang upon this Exhortation or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition? Doubtleſs thus, that when Chriſtians ſhall come to this
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95016:133"/>paſs, that this ſhall be the temper, and ſtate, and preſent frame of their hearts, that they care to go no further, nor to underſtand no more in the Myſtery of their Profeſſion; this is a certain (or at leaſt a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous) ſign that they are in a condition near to that of falling away, and relapſing from thoſe very principles and foundations themſelves, which they had embraced. And if you will but conſider how it is in the courſe of nature, you ſhall obſerve that it is the nature of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to advance and go on ſtill, to move and to wax: But whenſoever this Creature cometh to a ſtand, and goeth no further, evermore the next motion is to relapſe. The Sun in the Firmament of Heaven, when he comes to his Meridian, and can riſe no higher, begins immediately to decline towards his ſetting. The Waters wax, and flow, and encreaſe; but ever when it is ſtanding water, then is the reflux in a ſhort time, it altereth its courſe backwards from whence it came. Juſt thus is it in this great and important buſineſs of your Souls, and of your Eternal Peace; it is well with you ſo long as you are growing and gathering, ſo long you are in a ſafe condition, and out of danger of falling away: But when you come once to ſuch a paſs that you deſire to riſe no higher, it is a thouſand to one but that the next news, that will be heard, will be that you will begin to decline and loſe ground, and to fall back again into your former ignorance, and unto the love of the World, and ſomething which is of an utter inconſiſtency with your Salvation.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> The Second Queſtion propounded, namely, How, or by what means a Believer, or any other Perſon, may be filled with the Spirit of God. Some difficulties removed, with one direction propounded, and largely diſcourſed, whereby men and women may underſtand the intent of the Exhortation, and what it is that is required of them when they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be filled with the Spirit. VVherein alſo the Grace of God, and the free working of his Spirit is clearly vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and aſſerted.</head>
               <p>HAving formerly finiſhed the Demonſtration and proof of the truth of the Doctrine, for the clearer underſtanding it, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> and making better way to the Uſe and Application, we propounded three Queſtions to be taken into conſideration, and reſolved; the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions were theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Who, or what kind, or manner of Spirit it is of whom both the Text and Doctrine ſpeaks, and particularly, whether a finite and created Spirit, or an infinite and uncreated Spirit, God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?</p>
               <p>We have ſtood ſomewhat the longer upon the debate and arguing of this Queſtion, partly, becauſe of the great weight and importance of the truth, lying either on the one hand of it, or on the other; partly alſo, becauſe there is a Spirit lately, after a long baniſhmen, and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, come forth again into the World, and is now at work amongſt us, which oppoſeth with might and main that part of this Queſtion where the truth heth (as I truſt we have made manifeſts) and denieth the Spirit, the Holy Spirit (ſo much ſpoken of in the Scriptures) to be God. The debate of this Queſtion we have already finiſhed. Another of the three Queſtions was, How, or what courſe a Chriſtian, or any other Perſon, Man, or Woman, may, and ought to take to be filled with the Spirit? <hi>i.e.</hi> How, or after what manner the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion impoſed in the Text is to be obeyed or put in execution?</p>
               <p>The third (and laſt) Queſtion was, How a man or woman may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come to diſcern and know themſelves, or how others may come to the like knowledge of them, whether they be filled with the Spirit, I mean, the Spirit of God, or ſome other Spirit of another nature, and contrary to it? I ſuppoſe much light will be given by the examination of the truth in the Former of the two Queſtions for the deciſion of the Latter, ſo that we may be ſomewhat the briefer here.</p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:95016:134"/>
               <p>To begin then with the former of theſe Queſtions, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> how a Chriſtian, or a Believer, yea, or any other perſon may be filled with the Spirit, which the Text and Doctrine mention; for it will appear by the way that any other Perſon, as well as a Believer, is in a capacity (though ſomewhat more remote) of being filled with the Spirit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>What it is to be filled with the Spirit, hath been formerly declared in the opening of the Doctrine; notwithſtanding I conceive it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the reſolution of the Queſtion in hand, that we briefly remind you of what we delivered in that kind; we ſignified unto you, that to <hi>be filled with the Spirit,</hi> doth not note and import an abſolute and preciſe fulneſs; that is a having of the Spirit in ſuch a preciſe fulneſs and height that there is no capacity left of having more of him. No: but as in Scripture Phraſe a Veſſel is ſaid to be full when there is a good and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and competent proportion in it; and ſo in ordinary diſcourſe we ſay, a Cup is full of drink, not when it is full to the brim, but if there be a good quantity and proportion in it; juſt ſo a fulneſs with the Spirit doth not ſuppoſe or imply ſuch a uniform kind of fulneſs, as if no man could be ſaid to be full of the Spirit, but only he that is fulleſt of all: But if any perſon be acted by the Spirit, or doth quit himſelf like unto a man; he in whom the Spirit hath any conſiderable power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand may be truly ſaid to be filled with the Spirit; as <hi>David</hi> had many Worthies in his Army, and yet they did not reach or attain unto the three firſt, though they were worthy in their way; ſo there may be many Chriſtians, of ſeveral ſizes and degrees, who yet may be ſaid to be filled with the Spirit of God: So that in propriety of Phraſe it ſignifieth to have an actuous, vigorous, and operative preſence of the Holy Ghoſt in you, to enjoy his grace, love, and favour upon ſuch terms, as to receive from him, and from the glory of his power, ever and anon, upon all occaſions, excellent quicknings, incitements, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, enlargements, ſtrengthnings of heart and ſoul unto every wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy way, and every good work; to have all contrary workings, motions, and riſings of the fleſh borne down with a ſtrong hand, and ſwallowed up in victory, ſo that a man or woman ſhall find no great, no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable oppoſition or turmoile (as formerly) from any weakneſs or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption within him in his way of well-doing, but only ſuch which he ſhall be enabled, and this at a very good rate to overcome. I ſay, when this is found to be the caſe and condition of any Chriſtian, it is a ſign of ſuch a preſence or fulneſs of the Spirit of God. I here deſcribe unto you only that kind of <hi>filling with the Spirit,</hi> which is the duty of all Chriſtians (as of other perſons alſo in their way) to mind, look after, and be induſtriouſly careful to obtain, and which only (I conceive) is intended by the Apoſtle in the Text. For I do not conceive that he doth admoniſh and exhort the <hi>Epheſians to be filled with the Spirit;</hi> as
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95016:134"/>if his meaning ſhould be, that he would have them be filled with ſuch a kind of filling, by which ſome were enabled to work miracles, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal things ſecret and unrevealed in the Scriptures, being yet future and to come. Although I can eaſily believe, that even ſuch <hi>a filling with the Spirit</hi> as this (at leaſt to a conſiderable degree) was within the reach of Chriſtians in the Apoſtles daies; yea, and that the Apoſtle did exhort the <hi>Corinthians</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31.) to ſeek after ſome ſuch kind of <hi>filling</hi> as this in theſe words, but covet earneſtly after the beſt gifts. Doubtleſs he would not have had them to lay out themſelves with any deſire after theſe extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, as ſpeaking with Tongues, and Prophecying, but that there was a means for the attaining of them. But that filling with the Spirit which he commendeth to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> by way of duty in the words before us, is only, or at leaſt principally, ſuch a filling as we have both formerly, and even now deſcribed unto you, which reſpecteth the effectual ſtirring up, and ſtrengthening of the hearts and ſouls of men unto waies and works of righteouſneſs, and theſe of the worthieſt and moſt excellent kind and ſtrain. And yet it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like but that, if men and women ſhould quit themſelves worthily, and with faithfulneſs in this Race; I mean, in their endeavours <hi>to be filled with the Spirit</hi> in that kind or ſenſe we ſpeak of, there would be caſt in unto them, by way of heaped meaſure, ſomewhat of that kind of filling alſo; they ſhould have a kind of firſt fruits of thoſe extraordinary gifts of the Spirit alſo, as of healing of the ſick, declaring things to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I could give an account of my apprehenſion in this kind, and this in more particulars than one, were it not for fear of lengthening out this Diſcourſe in hand beyond what you are willing to bear.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> there is one thing more neceſſary (I conceive) to be touched here alſo, in order to your better ſatisfaction about the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in hand, though ſomething (as I remember) hath been ſpoken to it formerly; that is, How it can ſtand with the weakneſs and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of the Creature man on the one hand, and the incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Majeſty and Glory of the Holy Ghoſt on the other hand, that it ſhould be in the power of man to procure, or draw into himſelf, <hi>i.e.</hi> into his heart and ſoul, ſuch a rich or glorious preſence of the Spirit as that wherein our being <hi>filled</hi> with him conſiſts? Or whether in this caſe the Spirit may not be conceived to be obnoxious unto, or in the power of man? I am the rather deſirous to remove this ſtumbling block out of the way, before we go forward to give reply to the principal Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; becauſe I conceive it muſt needs be an incumbrance upon the mind and ſpirit of a man, and ſo an hindrance unto him from attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chearfully to any thing given by way of ſatisfaction touching the manner and means of obtaining a thing, when the thought of his heart is, that the thing is impoſſible to be obtained. Therefore, as to the Queſtion propounded about this, how ſuch a thing can be, or is likely
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95016:135"/>to be, that the Holy Ghoſt, and much more a fulneſs with the Holy Ghoſt ſhould be obtained by the endeavours of men? I reply,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That he is not to be obtained by the endeavours of men upon any ſuch terms, as if men were ſtronger than he, or could compel, or neceſſitate him by any force or ſtrength (properly ſo called) to turn in unto them, or the like; but this (I ſuppoſe) is the thought of no mans heart, <hi>Are we ſtronger than he</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22.) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore certainly it is not to be obtained upon any ſuch terms.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Neither is the Holy Ghoſt, nor a fulneſs with him to be obtained by the endeavours of men, upon any ſuch terms, or in any ſuch conſideration, as if there were any thing of any worth, goodneſs, or the like in the endeavours of men, in one kind or other, which might in a way of merit challenge the gift of the Holy Ghoſt from God, much leſs ſuch a meaſure of the Spirit, as the being filled with him importeth; No: the obtaining of the gift of the Holy Ghoſt upon ſuch terms as theſe, is like the redeeming of the Life or Soul of a man's Brother from the Grave, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7. which (as the Prophet ſaith) muſt ceaſe for ever; and ſuch a thought of heart in any man is not much better than that of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> when (as <hi>Peter</hi> chargeth him) he thought the <hi>gift of the Holy Ghoſt might be purchaſed with money.</hi> Therefore there is no ſuch thing as this any waies implied in the Doctrine in hand.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Neither is the Holy Ghoſt, or any fulneſs with him to be obtained by any endeavours of men, which originally ſpring from themſelves, or whereof they are the Authors: <hi>Not</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.) <hi>that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing</hi> (or to reaſon any thing, as the word ſignifieth, meaning, in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel) <hi>as of our ſelves, i. e.</hi> as originally, or radically of our ſelves. He doth not deny, but plainly ſuppoſeth and granteth, that in a ſenſe, and in ſome conſideration we are ſufficient of our ſelves, [<hi>viz.</hi> by vertue of thoſe abilities which are properly our own, being given us by God] to reaſon or think, after ſuch a manner as he ſpeaketh of: Only he denies, that in ſuch a ſenſe or conſideration as this, we have any <hi>ſufficiency</hi> in this kind, <hi>viz.</hi> As if we our ſelves were the Authors of that ſufficiency that is in us, either by way of nature, or of any meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious procurement; becauſe (as he immediately adds) <hi>our ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is of God;</hi> namely, originally, fundamentally, and radically; not only by way of Creation, as he that raiſeth or worketh it in us; but alſo, as he that worketh it graciouſly, or freely, without any meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous engagement laid upon him by us to work it in us, or give it unto us. For that (in Scripture Phraſe) is ſaid properly, and preciſely to be of God, not ſimply which he acteth, or worketh, but that which he acteth or worketh freely without any either meritorious or demeritorious engagement laid upon him by the Creature. As for example, in caſe either <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> or any other perſon, <hi>had continued in all things
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95016:135"/>that are written in the Law to do them;</hi> I mean, had perfectly fulfilled the Law, God would have juſtified them, or declared them righteous upon it, yet had not this their juſtification (in ſtrictneſs or propriety of Scripture Phraſe) been of God, but of themſelves, though he had ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified them; becauſe they had wrought for it, and God in ſtrictneſs and rigour of juſtice could not have denied it them. And ſo that of our Apoſtle, concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> is (I conceive) to be underſtood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>For if Abraham were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, It ſhould not be tranſlated, <hi>but not before God</hi> (as we have it) but thus rather, <hi>he hath whereof to glory, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God,</hi> concerning any grace or favour received from God in his Juſtification. If his Juſtification had been by works, it had not been from God, but from himſelf: Upon the account of that Principle, which we now plead, the condemnation and deſtruction of wicked and impenitent men, though the execution be done by God, yet in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaticalneſs of Scripture Phraſe, it is ſaid to be procured from themſelves, and is diſowned by God, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe there is a demeritorious engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment layed upon God by the Creature to inflict it, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf:</hi> So that neither in this reſpect or ſenſe is it a truth, that the Holy Ghoſt, or a being filled with him is procured by the endeavours of men, in a meritorious way, or as if any thing that men can do did any waies oblige God, in way of juſtice, to fill any man with the Spirit. Therefore,</p>
               <p>Fourthly, When we teach and affirm, that men may take a courſe, or uſe means to be filled with the Spirit, we do not make the Spirit obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto men, or unto their endeavours; but unto his own moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and free promiſe, unto his infinite goodneſs unto poor Creatures, only lead and guided by his infinite wiſdom. <hi>Thou haſt magnified thy Word above all thy Name, Pſal.</hi> 138.2. that is, he had ſubjected all his Attributes unto his Promiſe, and unto the Word that is gone out of his mouth, ſo that they ſhall ſerve the World, and bleſs the Sons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, according to what he hath declared in his Word.</p>
               <p>So that the reaſon why any man, by taking ſuch or ſuch a courſe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> or by uſing ſuch or ſuch endeavours, comes to be filled with the Spirit, is not becauſe he doth theſe things; there is no ſuch vertue, vigour, or ſtrength in them, in any thing that men can do, or are in a capacity of doing in this kind, which is able to produce an effect ſo glorious as the filling of the heart or ſoul of a man with the Spirit of the living God: But only becauſe the Will of God, and Word of God, which are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and wonderful in their operation, do here interpoſe, therefore doth it ſo come to paſs. And if God will give his Spirit, or a fulneſs of his Spirit unto men and women upon their obſervation of ſuch and ſuch directions from his mouth, who ſhall ask him, Why doſt thou ſo? That which men do for the obtaining of that fulneſs with the Spirit
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:95016:136"/>which we ſpeak of is little other than Sacramental. Now ſuch cauſes which work and contribute towards their effects Sacramentally only, are in reſpect of that which is litteral, or natural in them, the pooreſt and loweſt of all cauſes being of that kind of cauſes, which Logicians call <hi>Cauſa ſinè quâ non;</hi> the cauſe without which the effect is not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be produced, which becauſe it contributeth little or nothing at all to the effect, unleſs it be its bare preſence, therefore they call it <hi>Cauſa fatua,</hi> the fooliſh cauſe, or the fools cauſe; I ſuppoſe for this reaſon, becauſe none but weak and ſimple Perſons will inſiſt upon this kind of cauſe, in reaſoning about effects, and the Cauſes and Reaſons of them, <hi>viz.</hi> if a Queſtion were moved, Why ſuch a man runs ſo ſwiftly? He that ſhould anſwer, Becauſe his head ſtands on his ſhoulders, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his heart is in his body, or the like, ſhould ſhew himſelf very weak; becauſe though theſe be cauſes <hi>Sinè quibus non,</hi> ſuch cauſes, as without which the effect of running would not, or could not be performed, A man could not run unleſs his head ſtood on his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; yet his head ſtanding on his ſhoulders, contributes nothing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in a very remote and inconſiderable manner towards it; and beſides takes place in many, in whom no ſuch effect as ſwiftneſs of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to be found. If a man ſhould ask the reaſon why the Waters of the red Sea were divided when time was, and ſtood upon heaps like a Wall, on the right hand, and on the left hand of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as they paſſed through? He that ſhall ſay, this was the reaſon or cauſe of it, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſmote theſe waters with the Rod in his hand, ſhould quit himſelf very weakly in ſo ſaying; though it be probable, that without this, without <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſo ſmiting them they would not have been ſo divided. There is the like conſideration of the falling down of the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> upon the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> compaſſing them about ſeven daies, and blowing with Trumpets made of Rams horns; of <hi>Naaman's</hi> cleanſing from his Leproſie by waſhing ſeven times in <hi>Jordan.</hi> This is an Eſſential or diſtinguiſhing property or Character of Sacramental cauſes; that though there be very little, or nothing in them (I mean, in that which is litteral, natural, and external in them) any waies apt or likely to produce their effects, as there is in natural cauſes to produce theirs; yet notwithſtanding they produce their effects moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, moſt powerfully, and with an high hand. The reaſon is, becauſe the power of God is pleaſed to interpoſe, and mingle it ſelf with theſe more conſtantly, and with a higher advance (for the moſt part) than with natural cauſes. The reaſon of this good pleaſure of his (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably) may be, not becauſe Sacraments, or Sacramental cauſes are more appropriate and peculiar Inſtitutions or Ordinances of his than Nature, or natural Cauſes are; But becauſe they are weak, and of no ſtrength in themſelves to do that which they have to do. Upon this account, as he hath taught men by the light of Nature, in ordering the habit of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:95016:136"/>their bodies, <hi>Upon their uncomely parts to put more comelineſs;</hi> according to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>We have this treaſure in earthen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels that the power might</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi> might clearly appear to] <hi>be of God, and not of us:</hi> So becauſe Sacraments and Sacramental Cauſes are in themſelves weak; and without honour (in reſpect of what Natural Cauſes have) therefore God honours them ſo much the more abundantly with his ſtrength and preſence in them. <hi>Sed hoc obiter.</hi> Now to draw the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Diſcourſe cloſe to the buſineſs in hand, when we teach that men by hearkening unto the Counſel of God, and doing that which he hath commanded, in order to the obtaining of ſuch a bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as a being <hi>filled with his Spirit,</hi> may obtain it, we neither make the Spirit obnoxious unto men, but unto himſelf, and unto his own good pleaſure; Nor do we attribute any thing more unto thoſe Actions or Endeavours of men, by which they obtain a being filled with him, than a kind of Sacramental Efficacy, and this depending only upon the gracious will and good pleaſure of God; God having inſtituted ſuch and ſuch means in order to this bleſſed end, upon occaſion hereof he ſtandeth engaged to his truth and faithfulneſs in giving out his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Grace.</p>
               <p>Fifthly (and laſtly) When we do affirm, that the Spirit (and ſo a fulneſs with him) is attainable by men in the uſe of means; as we do exclude all things by way of merit, and likewiſe all ſuch endeavours in this kind which are originally in men themſelves: So we do ſuppoſe, that without the Spirit, that is, without a being prevented, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome meaſure of the Spirit already given, no man is able to put forth his hand unto any of thoſe works or actions, whereby this ſame filling with the Spirit is to be obtained. So that if we ſearch the ſpring of theſe actions and waies of men, whereby we affirm that the Spirit may be attained, we do not find the Root in man, but in ſomething that is Extrinſical. For though it be in a man, yet is it not of the heart and ſoul of a man, co-ſubſtantial with it; but the root of theſe actions, by which men are capable of <hi>filling</hi> themſelves with the Spirit of God, is not in themſelves, nor in their nature, but it is in an External Agent, who is God, or rather indeed the Spirit of God himſelf; as we ſhall ſhew you in the traverſing of this great buſineſs. For it is likely we ſhall have occaſion to dive into that Queſtion, Whether all the men and women in the World are not prevented according to the general courſe of the Providence of God in governing of the World, and ſetting forth men and women upon the Theatre of the Earth? Whether they be not all prevented without asking, or without any means uſed, with ſo much of the Spirit of God, and with ſuch a preſence of his, as that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are enabled to have more of him, and to be filled more with him?</p>
               <p>Having thus with as much brevity and plainneſs, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> as through the grace
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:95016:137"/>of God we were able to do, removed that ſtumbling ſtone (as we cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it) out of the way: A conceit incident (as we conceived) unto ſome, that there is no poſſibility for men or women to be filled with the Spirit of God by any courſe they can take, by any means they can uſe; We proceed now to enquire into the Scriptures, what courſe it is that men ought to take to poſſeſs themſelves of ſuch a bleſſedneſs, as a being filled with the Spirit of God imports: yea, and which they muſt take if ever they deſire to be made great in the ſight of God or men by being <hi>filled</hi> with the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing to be done by us, in order to a being <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> (it being ſuppoſed we are clear and thoroughly ſatisfied about the poſſibility of the thing; for otherwiſe this Corner-ſtone were to be laid for the building) but this (I ſay) ſuppoſed, the firſt thing to be done, in direct order to a being filled with the Spirit, is, (in the Apoſtle's words in a like caſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31.) <gap reason="foreign">

Now evident it is, that the Apoſtle (in the place now cited) preſcribeth this ſame <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, This earneſt or zealous coveting after <hi>the better gifts,</hi> in order to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of them at the hand of God; otherwiſe, To what end or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhould he enjoyn ſuch a thing? It is not to be imagined that he ſhould exhort them, <hi>zealouſly to covet</hi> ſuch things which were not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to obtain and enjoy. No: nor yet ſuch things the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof were not to be obtained or procured by ſuch their earneſt <hi>coveting.</hi> Now if this earneſt or zealous coveting of thoſe gifts of the Spirit, which the Apoſtle there means (and of which he had particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken immediately before) were a means, either in whole, or in part to attain them; doubtleſs the ſame courſe, the like <hi>zealous coveting,</hi> is a proper means alſo, though not an adequate or compleat means for the obtaining of ſuch a fulneſs of the Spirit of which we ſpeak. For if God be enclined to hearken unto, to accommodate the earneſt deſires of men, when they are lifted up unto ſuch objects, ſuch things that are of a periſhing nature, be they never ſo well uſed or managed (for of this kind were thoſe gifts of the Spirit, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the place mentioned, as himſelf alſo expreſly teſtifieth and confeſſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.) And conſequently are of affinity with the outward peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhable things of this World, as Silver, Gold, Meats, Drinks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if then (I ſay) God were ſo far indulgent, or reſpectful to the zealous
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95016:137"/>deſires of men after the tranſient gifts of the Spirit, ſuch whereof Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who did not truly love God were capable, that he was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe to gratifie them; much more have we reaſon to judge that he will look towards ſuch deſires of men, eſpecially, if they be raiſed to any fervency, or height, when they are bent upon ſuch a filling with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that will commend them in his ſight, and which being maintained and perſevered in, will make them great in the Kingdom of Heaven for ever. Our Saviour, ſpeaking of things of a tranſient nature, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to mens ſeeking of things that are permanent and enduring, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly informs the world, that if men ſhall be diligent in ſeeking theſe latter, thoſe other ſhall collaterally, and (as it were) on the by, be caſt upon them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Firſt ſeek the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c. Indeed, men and women generally go ſo to work, as if the tenour of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Counſel ran counter, and was quite contrary to what now it is. That in caſe men would ſeek in the firſt place the things of this World, and the conveniences thereof, what they ſhould eat, or what they ſhould drink, or wherewith they ſhould be cloathed, that then all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to the Kingdom of God ſhould be caſt in unto them. For there is an high ſeeking after theſe things (almoſt) on every hand; as if God were ſo far from caſting them in unto men, upon the account our Saviour ſpeaks of, that men muſt deny themſelves in the things of God, and of their eternal peace to lay out themſelves whole and entire with all their might, and all their ſtrength for the wreſting of them out of his hand. But whatſoever men think or do in this kind, the word of the faithful Witneſs of Heaven remaineth firm and ſtedfaſt; nor hath God made the leaſt tittle or iota of any promiſe or overture of caſting in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things unto men upon their deſires or endeavours after outward things, but ever and anon labours to reduce men to ſobriety and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in both theſe, that ſo they may be found in a better capacity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſpiritual things from him.</p>
               <p>If you ask me, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> But what may be the reaſon that God ſhould ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly and highly eſteem the zealous deſires or covetings of men after ſpiritual things above the like deſires in them after earthly things? Or why, conſidering that both kinds of things are good and from himſelf, yet zealous covetings after the former take his heart and ſoul; the like after theſe are an offence unto him, and ſeparate between him and his Creature?</p>
               <p>To this I reply, firſt Negatively, the reaſon is not preciſely becauſe the former deſires are commanded by him (I mean, zealous deſires after ſpiritual things;) and the latter not commanded, but forbidden. The commanding of the former by God in conjunction, with a prohibition of the latter is ſufficient proof that he doth indeed accept the one, and not the other, but it is not the reaſon, at leaſt not the Adequate, nor the principal reaſon why he doth ſo accept them. A man may do that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95016:138"/>which is commanded by God, and yet have little thank for his labour for doing it, <hi>viz.</hi> when he knoweth not that it is commanded by him. A ſtumbling (as it were) at unawares upon the Letter of commands, is of no great acceptance with God, which yet it would and muſt be, if it were ſimply the Command of God, that rendered an Act, done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of the Letter of it, acceptable unto him. Again, ſome things commanded by God, may accidentally fall in with mens carnal ends and deſires; and upon ſuch an account as this they may do them: As Children that have rich Parents, from whom they expect great matters at their death, or otherwiſe, in the mean time to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate their hopes and expectations in this kind, they may honour and obey them; many the like caſes might be readily put. But now, that which Children do in ſuch caſes, though it be commanded (at leaſt in the Letter) by God, yet this renders it of a very ſlender acceptation with him. Therefore moſt certain it is, that the primary reaſon (at leaſt) why any mans doing the Command of God is accepted with him is not this: becauſe he doth that which God hath commanded; for then in what caſe ſoever men ſhould do that which God hath commanded there would be acceptance, which we have ſhewed is not true. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the Affirmative, the true reaſon (or reaſons, for they are rather two than one) why mens zealous deſires after ſpiritual things, and eſpecially after a being filled with the Spirit are of ſuch a high and ſoveraign acceptation with God, as hath been ſignified; whereas the like zealous deſires in them, after things appertaining to this life are offenſive unto him, are theſe:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe they willingly and knowingly ſubmit unto his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he commandeth and requireth of men to be zealouſly affected towards ſpiritual things, whereas he prohibiteth the like towards earthly things. And</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe it is reaſonable for men to be zealouſly bent for the obtaining of the former, as being far more profitable and advantageous unto them; whereas the like zeal towards the latter is very irrational, hath no ſavour of true or ſound reaſon in it; as being (indeed) clearly repugnant to their ſupream good and real benefit. For this is a true Rule in general, that God is well pleaſed with all ſuch Counſels, Actions, and waies of men, which are in their nature, and according to a true eſtimate and judgment of them, profitable and advantageous: and he is the more and better pleaſed with the Counſels, Actions, and waies of men, the richer and fuller connexion they have with their peace and happineſs. So that when men do upon a good account, willingly, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, and deliberately ſubject themſelves unto his will and pleaſure, and do the things which he commands, he is well pleaſed with what they do: but the original and grand reaſon why he is ſo well pleaſed
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:95016:138"/>with what they do in this caſe, is not becauſe they do what he hath commanded, but becauſe in doing what he hath commanded, they follow the clear ducture and guidance of the light of Reaſon, Judgment, and Underſtanding, which he hath planted in them to direct them to the things of their peace. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is moſt rational to do that which God commandeth men, whereas it is contrary to reaſon, and that in the higheſt degree, to do that which he prohibits.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe the things themſelves which God commandeth, as they are in themſelves, and in their own nature ſuted unto the heart of God; ſo likewiſe is it moſt agreeable unto reaſon that men ſhould do them, as being moſt commodious for themſelves. And this is the true reaſon why God accepteth men hereupon, it being moſt agreeable to the higheſt Principles of Reaſon in the World, that the Creature ſhould be ſubject unto God. When men ſhall obey him, he is not ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with them ſimply becauſe they do obey him, as becauſe they quit themſelves likemen of Wiſdom and ſound Underſtanding therein, and ſteer a courſe to advance their own happineſs; as is evident from hence, becauſe he is willing and content, that if men could find out a better God than he, a God from whom they might tolerably expect better and greater things than they have ground upon their obedience to expect from him; he is willing and content (I ſay) upon ſuch terms, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige them from himſelf, and where ever they can find him, to give them leave to turn Proſelyte to ſuch a God, though he ſhould loſe their ſervice thereby. This is evident from that ſaying of his great Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 Kings 18.21. <hi>How long halt you between two?</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, never deſtroy your ſelves, do not ſometime go to the true God and worſhip him, and otherwhile unto <hi>Baal;</hi> for (ſaith he) <hi>if Baal be-he,</hi> if you can ſatisfie your ſelves, or come at any ſubſtantial reaſon to prove, that <hi>Baal</hi> is he that can bleſs you, and make you great, and ſave you, and make you Kings and Princes for ever; <hi>If Baal be-he, then ſerve him.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, God doth not deſire the ſervice, nor the application of his Creature to him in any way of obedience or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but only in reference to the Creatures good; and he doth deſire it on ſuch terms, that if they knew better to beſtead themſelves, or to find out a God of more grace and power, they have free leave from heaven to follow him.</p>
               <p>And beſides, the main end why God hath given Precepts and Laws unto men, himſelf hath declared to be, not that he might be ſerved ſimply, or be obeyed by them; but rather indeed that he might ſerve them, or (as himſelf expreſſeth it) that he might do them good in their latter end, <hi>Dent.</hi> 8.16. &amp; 6.24. &amp; 10.13. implying, that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come at the Creature to make him ſuch in happineſs and in glory, as his heart and ſoul deſireth, unleſs he be in a meet capacity, having
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:95016:139"/>quitted himſelf like unto a man. And the reaſon, why God making Oath unto <hi>Abraham</hi> for the confirmation of the great Promiſe which he had given him, ſware by himſelf, is ſaid to be this, <hi>viz. That he had no greater to ſwear by,</hi> Heb. 6.13. implying, that if there had been any God above him, any that could have been a ground of greater aſſurance unto them, it had been given them: In like manner it may be ſaid, if there could be any way wherein the Creature could ſpeed better, that was like to be more beneficial unto it, he would not have them hang their hope, confidence, and expectation upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he would have tranſmitted them unto that God. <hi>Sed hac obiter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, by the light of this Diſcourſe we clearly ſee, why God ſo highly prizeth zealous covetings, and deſires in men after ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe ſuch covetings as theſe are moſt reaſonable to be found in men, and have an excellent connexion with their ſupreme good and happineſs. If this be queſtioned or doubted, there is this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon near at hand (over and beſides the conſideration of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) to make it evident, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſuch covetings and deſires never fail to raiſe endeavours ſutable unto themſelves for the obtaining of things ſo coveted and deſired.</p>
               <p>If you here ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> that in preſcribing ſuch a courſe of means as that now exhibited, for your being filled with the Spirit, I preſcribe you that which is hard to come by: you know not how to create, or raiſe any ſuch coveting, any ſuch ſtrong deſires within you as theſe recommended unto you.</p>
               <p>To this I reply, That the goodneſs, excellency, and deſirableneſs of the thing it ſelf (I mean, your being filled with the Spirit) if you will but give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a narrow and intenſe beholding with the eyes of your minds and underſtandings, and feed a while upon the beauty and glory of it; this will furniſh you, will raiſe in you theſe covetings and deſires we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in order to the obtaining of it. And indeed it is a general Rule, that all objects whatſoever, whether good or evil, will beget or raiſe affections in men, anſwerable to that degree, either of good or evil, that is apprehended in them, if men will narrowly and frequently mind and confider them. Yea, if men apprehend either more good, or more evil in any thing than is really and in truth to be found in them, and will feed upon ſuch apprehenſions, and oft repeat and renew them, they will ſoon love and hate them proportionably above that which they ought to do. For this reaſon it is, that <hi>Solomon</hi> forbad men <hi>to look upon Wine when it is red, and giveth its colour in the Cup</hi> (or glaſs) <hi>when it mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it ſelf upright,</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> when it ſprings or ſparkles] <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.31. <hi>Look not on it when it is red,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i.e.</hi> do not fix thine eye upon it, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue looking on it (for ſo the word looking oft imports) his meaning is not, that a man ſhould not ſimply ſee, or caſt his eye upon it, as if
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95016:139"/>there would be danger in ſuch a caſe; for then he could not tell when, or how to obſerve this Precept: but his meaning is, if a man will fix his eye upon it, there is danger of being inflamed with inordinate love un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. So our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.28. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall look on a woman to luſt after her</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> until he luſts after her, or after any ſuch manner that he comes to luſt after her] <hi>hath committed adultery with her in his heart.</hi> Now this ſheweth when, and how this luſting cometh to be propagated in the heart; if there be any lovelineſs in the Creature, this may draw our hearts forth as it were of courſe unto ſuch covetings. The reaſon why men and women hate not ſin with a more vehement, vigorous, and perfect hatred, than generally they do, is partly becauſe they do not frequently, and with intenſeneſs of mind, conſider the abundance of evil that is in it, that violent and virulent Antipathy or contrariety that is in it to their comfort and peace in many kinds. For certain it is, that ſin hath enough in it to ſet all the World on fire with enmity to it. Yea, as the <hi>Devil</hi> when he had ſinned, had that in him, and upon him, which being looked upon by God was ſufficient to throw him down from Heaven into the bottom of Hell: So likewiſe hath ſin, that in it which being clearly ſeen, and diligently conſidered by men, is ſufficient to caſt it down out of the heavens of mens love and deſires into the deepeſt hell of their hatred and indignation. So on the other hand, it is as true concerning righteouſneſs in general, (which <hi>Plato</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher had a glimmering of.) And as it is with Righteouſneſs in general, ſo it is with and alſo concerning that excellent peece or member of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we ſpeak, (A being <hi>filled with the Spirit.</hi>) This is ſuch a Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece of humane felicity, it hath ſo much worth, and goodneſs, and deſirableneſs in it, that was it thoroughly known, and frequently whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the thoughts and minds of men and women, they need take no further care how to come by ſuch <hi>covetings</hi> after it, as thoſe now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto you as a means (in the firſt place) to obtain it: (unleſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily it be to ſatisfie themſelves in this; that it is nothing but what is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable: For if (indeed) you ſhall look upon it as a thing abſolutely out of your reach, your ſouls will hardly put forth in coveting or deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after it.) But this ſcruple being removed, you would ſoon find your hearts full of thoſe covetings and deſires; ſo full that they would not be long able to contain themſelves, but that they would break forth and utter themſelves in ſuch other waies and means which they ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be proper and likely to obtain it.</p>
               <p>If you ask me, But what is there ſo excellent, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> ſo greatly deſirable in this being filled with the Spirit, which being known and narrowly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by us, muſt needs (as you ſay) ſet us on coveting after it, and ſo put us into a nearer capacity of obtaining it?</p>
               <p>I reply firſt in the general, the deſirableneſs of it is ſuch, ſo exceeding great, that neither the Tongue of men or Angels are ſufficient to expreſs
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95016:140"/>it; it is of kin to the peace of God, and partakes herewith in that property that it <hi>paſſeth all underſtanding:</hi> ſo that when we ſhall travel many dales, yea, many years, with our minds and underſtandings, to ſearch out and diſcover the riches of it, we ſhall leave much hereof undiſcovered and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. But more particulary.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such a filling with the Spirit as we ſpeak of, will leave no place for fooliſh and hurtful luſts in one kind or other, to play their parts within us, which (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith) 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Fight againſt the ſoul;</hi> that is, againſt the peace, comfort, and proſperity of it. As upon the bringing in of the Ark into the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle was filled with ſmoak, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.34. And ſo in the Dedication of the Temple the Prieſts could not enter, becauſe of the glory there, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.10, 11. even ſo, when the ſoul, when the inner Temple of the heart of a man or woman ſhall be filled with the Spirit of God, there will be ſuch a glory of holineſs there, that there will be no ſtanding or abode for thoſe baſe Companions, unclean, impure, carnal and ſenſual deſires and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. No: but they will all be ſcattered, as the Miſt is ſcattered before the Sun when it ariſeth in its might. Theſe Companions (which have haunted your ſouls and inner man hitherto) Pride, Envy, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and inordinate love of the World, Pleaſure, Eaſe, and all ſuch kind of things as theſe, they will be ſenſible of the glorious preſence of this Spirit of God in you, they will not be able to abide it: his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence will fright away all thoſe Aliens and ſtrangers that are contrary to him.</p>
               <p>It is true, the greateſt filling with the Spirit, that fleſh and bloud is (at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is clear from many Scriptures, and particularly from that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17.. <hi>For the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit.</hi> When by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the contrary luſtings between the Fleſh and the Spirit, he ſaith they <hi>cannot do the things they would;</hi> he ſpeaks not ſo much (indeed not at all) of the ſpecies, kind, or ſubſtance of the Action, but of the ſpiritual and exact manner of performing it. <hi>Yea, cannot do the things ye would;</hi> his meaning is not, that though they were willing to pray, yet becauſe of the luſting of the fleſh they could not pray; or though they were willing to hear the word, yet they could not hear: but thus, ye cannot pray, ye cannot hear, or ye cannot give Alms as ye would; that is, with as much Faith, with as much Fervency, with as much Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and enlargement of Heart and Soul as ye deſire: The Fleſh will be ſtill interrupting, and mingling it ſelf with your actions; and in preciſeneſs and ſtrictneſs of ſpeech, that which a ſervant of God, or ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man properly would do, is not ſimply to pray or ſimply to hear, or to give Alms, or the like; But to do theſe, and all other ſervices and actions after the beſt and pureſt manner, without any reluctancy, or
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:95016:140"/>gainſayingneſs, or interruption: ſo that when men pray and do not pray thus, when they hear, and give Alms, and do not both the one and the other upon ſuch terms as theſe, they cannot properly be ſaid <hi>to do the things they would.</hi> For that kind of Prayer which they would pray is one thing, and the prayer which they do make, or pray is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the Prayer which they would pray is ſuch a prayer, which in all points anſwereth the holineſs and perfection of the Commandment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by God in that behalf; that Prayer which they do pray is a Prayer many waies defective, having many infirmities cleaving unto it; ſo likewiſe the hearing, and the giving Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in this ſenſe it is moſt true, that the beſt of men and women <hi>cannot do the things they would.</hi> And in this ſenſe alſo the Apoſtle is to be underſtood ſpeaking of himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18, 19. <hi>How to perform that which is good I find not:</hi> And again, <hi>The good that I would I do not:</hi> How to perform that which is good I find not, <hi>i. e.</hi> I cannot find any courſe, way, or means how I may be enabled to perform that which is ſimply and perfectly good, that which in all points anſwereth the holineſs and ſpiritualneſs of the Law of God, <hi>which is the good that I would do;</hi> the object of my will and deſire is not to do any thing weakly and defectively, but all things after the moſt perfect manner; and ſuch things as theſe <hi>I find not,</hi> (<hi>i.e.</hi> by all the care that I can take, nor by all the diligence that I can uſe I cannot find) <hi>how to perform.</hi> By the way, the Apoſtle ſaying unto the <hi>Galatians, So that ye cannot do the things that ye would,</hi> is as a Sword paſſing through the ſoul of thoſe who are called perfectioniſts amongſt us, caſting down the Crown of their conceit of perfection to the ground; unleſs they dally with the word, and by perfection mean that which all underſtanding and ſober Chriſtians admit of, and hold as well as themſelves: ſuch a perfection as ſometimes paſſeth in the Scriptures under that name, and is aſcribed unto the Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> A comparative perfection, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, whether in faith, or knowledge, or manners, or tenour of life and converſation, which is in perſons termed ſpiritual above what is found in thoſe termed Babes in Chriſt, and carnal; there is no man that underſtandeth any thing in the Scriptures, but acknowledgeth thus much very attainable in this life: but if by <hi>perfection</hi> they mean that which is ſtrictly and properly ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch a ſtate wherein men and women ſin not, offend not at all, the Scripture hath given expreſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt them, and their conceit of perfection over and over; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one place, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>In many things we offend all.</hi> In another, <hi>Ye cannot do the thing ye would.</hi> In a third, <hi>Who liveth and ſinneth not?</hi> In a fourth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> (To omit other places as full of enmity againſt the Doctrine of perfection as theſe) but this only by the way. But</p>
               <p>To the Point before us: when we affirm, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> that a being filled with the Spirit will leave no ſpace nor room in the heart or ſoul of a man or
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:95016:141"/>woman for any unclean, worldly, or ſinful luſts, to ſtand and act their parts there; Our meaning is, that ſuch luſts as theſe will have no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to magnifie themſelves there, to make head, or gather ſtrength, whereby to be much troubleſome unto us: they will not be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive (as <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>Luſt when it hath conceived bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth ſin, and ſin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth death.</hi> As you have ſome Plants and Trees that with much a do will grow and live for a while in the Earth, or Soyl, or Air, but will not thrive, or flouriſh, or bear fruit according to their kind, but may be reſembled to the Widow the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, living in pleaſure, <hi>They are dead even whilſt they live:</hi> So likewiſe when ye are filled with the Spirit, though the fleſh will be fleſh ſtill, and be ever and anon attempting, and putting forth, yet there will be no great heart or ſtrength in theſe attempts, they will be but faint and weak, as deſpairing of any gratification or fulfilling: this is evident from the Scriptures, and particularly from that <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. from whence we even now heard, that by reaſon of the contrary luſtings of the Fleſh againſt the Spirit men cannot do the things they would (in the ſenſe lately opened) by reaſon of the interruption and oppoſition of the Fleſh to the Spirit; yet ſaith the Apoſtle in the next preceding verſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>This I ſay then, walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh;</hi> or as the original hath it ſomewhat more emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, ye ſhall at no hand, or in no wiſe <hi>fulfil the luſts of the Fleſh,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, (with a double negation.) <hi>Now to walk in the Spirit,</hi> or by the Spirit is the ſame thing which the Apoſtle calls (elſewhere) a being led by the Spirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> an uniform ſubjecting himſelf to the motions and holy ſuggeſtions or overtures of the Spirit of God in him. And to walk in the Spirit, or <hi>to be led by the Spirit</hi> ſuppoſeth ſome degree (at leaſt) <hi>of being filled with the Spirit;</hi> becauſe if the Spirit do not bear and beat ſomewhat ſtrong in the Souls and Conſciences of men, they will not be led uniformly by him: becauſe where he (I mean the Spirit) doth not bear to ſome conſiderable degree of ſtrength, the Fleſh will overbear his motions: even as a ſtrong Tide or ſtream will carry a Ship down againſt the Wind, unleſs it blow a ſtiff Gale. But if men <hi>be filled with the Spirit,</hi> ſo that the exhibitings and quicknings thereof be pregnant and lively, and the impulſes and bearings thereof upon the Conſcience and Soul be ſtiff, and ſtrong, and with power, the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, motions, and luſtings of the Fleſh will be overborne and ſtifled: even as a Veſſel upon the water, meeting a ſtout Ship running before a ſtrong gale of wind, is eaſily overſet and run under water by her. If you be full of the Spirit, theſe luſts themſelves will fly from you, and there will be no abiding for them in you; they will take no pleaſure at all in ſuch a ſoul, neither will ſuch a Soul find much to do with them; there will be an agreement on both Parties to divide and ſeparate; they are contrary one unto another, and they cannot dwell together, becauſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95016:141"/>they are not agreed, and in this caſe the ſtrong muſt keep poſſeſſion, and the weaker muſt give place. <hi>And he that is in you</hi> (ſaith <hi>John,</hi> ſpeaking of the Spirit of God) <hi>is greater than he that is againſt you.</hi> Now the World and the things of it are the Devils black Retinue and Regiment that attend upon him, that promote the Affairs of his Kingdom; and when the caſe is come to this, that the Soul muſt be poſſeſt, and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by one Spirit, either by him that is greater, or him that is leſſer, and his Retinue; in this caſe, if you bring in the Spirit of God into your Soul, you ſhall by one and the ſame Act, as it were, expel and drive out all that Retinue: Even as Chriſt coming into the Temple drove out thoſe that bought and ſold, and the Money Changers; juſt thus will be the coming of the Spirit of God in Power, and in Glory in your Souls; he will chaſe away from before his face all that rabble of evil doers, your unclean luſts and deſires, your fooliſh, froward, and proud diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſtempers of Soul. Now conſider a little of how great and ſacred a conſequence ſuch a thing as this is, to have the Temples of your hearts, of your inner man, thus purged and rid of ſuch Polluters and Prophaners of their dignity, excellency, and peace. My Brethren, Men and women live, as it were, by the fulfilling and ſatisfying of their luſts and unclean deſires, they are afraid that they ſhould not make a life of their continuance in the World, and being in the body, unleſs they take pleaſure in ſuch things, and in ſuch waies; unleſs they ſatisfie ſuch and ſuch deſires: whereas (alas) were they but free from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinacy of their deſires, their ſatisfying and gratifications would be rather matter of burthen, trouble, and cumber to them than any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. As perſons that have the itch, it is a pleaſure to them to ſcratch, but when the diſtemper in the skin is taken away, no man complains that he wanteth his former pleaſure of ſcratching: Even ſo whilſt men and women are laden with Luſts, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Uncleaneſs, and given to pleaſure, it is little leſs than a death to them to be kept from the fulfilling and gratifying theſe luſts and diſtempers; but if theſe luſts were but healed and ſeparated, as they may be (for they are not of the Eſſence of their ſouls) they are no part of their Nature or Being; no, they are but ſtrangers and aliens unto their ſouls; If theſe, I ſay, were but ſeparated from them, if they were but mortified and gone, theſe kind of waies, whereby they were to be gratified, would be altogether unſatisfying unto them, and would have no tafte or reliſh at all: The truth is, they would not only find no reliſh, nor any ſavour in them, but they would be troubleſome, they would be matter of ſhame and confuſion unto them. And therefore it muſt needs be conceived as a matter of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, high, and bleſſed concernment unto men and women, to be inveſted with ſuch a heavenly priviledge as this is, to have the inner man healed of all that unclean Retinue of Luſts and ſinful diſtempers, to have theſe removed and thrown out of the Soul. There is a great
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:95016:142"/>deal more to be ſaid to make theſe things very deſirable in your eyes, but we may have occaſion to ſpeak of this Point in the Progreſs of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Thus then you ſee, that where men <hi>are filled with the Spirit of God,</hi> the luſts of the fleſh are like to have but ſmall trading; they are there but as if they were not; they have no joy in ſuch ſouls, nor theſe ſouls much ſorrow and trouble with them: and the ſerious conſideration of this we teach to be a very effectual means to raiſe ſuch <hi>Covetings,</hi> ſuch earneſt Deſires, ſuch Longings and Breathings of heart after it as have been mentioned. So great and excellent is that heavenly accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of being delivered from the troubleſome and dangerous impotunity of fleſhly and worldly luſts by being filled with the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> Another thing that will attend, and muſt needs be the conſequence of a mans being filled with the Spirit is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That a man hereby will become little ſenſible of impreſſions of Sorrow, Grief, and Trouble from the World, and the croſs workings and dealings of things unto him there: His ſoul, by means of being filled with the Spirit, will be able to dwell amongſt Lions (even as <hi>Daniel</hi> did) without fear or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being deſtroyed and devoured with them: Thoſe Afflictions, Preſſures, and Trials, which will grind the faces and break the bones of other men, will not create any Grief, Pain, or Trouble unto him. For to be filled with the Spirit is a kind of ſpiritual drunkenneſs (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle implieth in the Text) and indeed hath effects in its kind, in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual way, anſwerable unto thoſe of drunkenneſs, litterally, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prerly ſo called; ſuch as thoſe mentioned by <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 23.34, 35. <hi>Thou ſhalt be as he that lieth down in the midſt of the Sea,</hi> or as <hi>he that lieth upon the top of a Maſt. They have ſtricken me ſhalt thou ſay, and I was not ſick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not:</hi> Meaning, that in fits of Drunkenneſs men are not ſenſible, either of any danger, though never ſo imminent and threatning, whereunto they are expoſed, nor of pain or ſmart by blows or wounds given them; In like manner, when men or women are filled with the Spirit of God, and ſo are in an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, ſerious, and affectionate converſe with thoſe glorious overtures of Comfort, Peace, and Joy, and with thoſe ſtrong and high impulſes and bearings upon their hearts and ſpirits unto waies and actions that are truly honourable and excellent, and which take hold of Eternal Life, which muſt be the portion of thoſe that are filled with the Spirit; they are not ſo much ſenſible of, nor liable to much ſorrow or trouble from the ſad or hard occurrences of the World. For when the ſtrength of the heart, and mind, and ſoul of a man are drunk up with matters of a more ſublime and glorious nature and conſequence, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left of him wherewith to become much capable or ſenſible of other things; eſpecially of thoſe, that are but of an inferiour concernment unto him. For that Principle in man, which renders him ſenſible or
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95016:142"/>apprehenſive of any thing relating unto him, whether on the right hand or on the left, whether good or evil, is the native vigour of his mind and underſtanding. Now then, if this be intirely or intenſly drawn forth, buſied, and taken up with minding and conſidering things of one kind, (eſpecially ſuch whereon the mind is much ſet and delighted with) a man is as it were in a Trance, or half dead, in reſpect of things of another nature; and though they be of a very troubleſome and afflicting nature in themſelves, yet do they little affect ſuch a man. As it was with our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.8, 31, 32, &amp;c. His mind and ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intenſly bent, and ſet upon the work he came about into the World, which he calleth the doing of his Fathers Will (meaning, his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel;) he was not ſenſible of his corporal hunger or want of natural ſuſtenance, under which he was: as appeareth <hi>verſe</hi> 8. and 31. compared. So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> being full of the Spirit, though he was in ſufferings abundantly; yea (I preſume) one of the greateſt ſufferers in the World for a long time together, yet the things that he ſuffered took little hold of him; (I mean) they made very little breach upon his comfort, or peace: he was upon the matter as well apaid in himſelf, even when the pains of hell (as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>i. e.</hi> fear, or apprehenſions of Death or the Grave compaſſed him about, as when the Sun of outward peace and proſperity ſhone with the greateſt bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon him. This might be made to appear from the many paſſages in his own writings, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. &amp; 6.10.</p>
               <p>Now how lovely, and above meaſure deſirable a priviledge is it, to have an heart that cannot be pierced, that cannot be wounded by the ſharpeſt Arrows that can be drawn out of the Quiver of this World, I ſhall not need to teach or inform you. I make no queſtion, but that you have a very vigorous and lively notion or impreſſion of it within you; however ſomething may be added to this Point hereafter. So then you ſee another thing very conſiderable in <hi>a being filled with the Spirit,</hi> the diligent working of which upon your hearts and ſouls muſt needs make you covetous after it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Your being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> will be unto you as an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in abundance into the Everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh) 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. And this in theſe three reſpects highly deſirable. Firſt, In reſpect of an excellent meaſure and degree of righteouſneſs and true holineſs. Secondly, In reſpect of a like meaſure or degree of inward and ſound peace. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and laſtly) in reſpect of that meaſure of joy alſo wherewith the heart and ſoul muſt needs be filled thereby. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (we know, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17.) placeth the Kingdom of God in theſe three: <hi>Righteouſneſs, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> in [or through] the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>The Kingdom of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not meat and drink, but Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. By the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi> he means nothing elſe, but the ſame thing, the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95016:143"/>ſame Kingdom which <hi>Peter</hi> calls the <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. Only <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemeth to ſpeak as well of it in reſpect of the manner and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as of the Priviledges and Happineſs of the Subjects thereof: the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> either only or chiefly mentions it in reſpect of the latter. This then is that we ſay, that in reſpect of both, as well in reſpect of that heavenly deportment or behaviour which is Univerſally uſed and practiced in this Kingdom, expreſſed by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the word Righteouſneſs, as in reſpect of the Priviledges and great Felicity ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the other two words, Joy, and Peace in the Holy Ghoſt: In reſpect, I ſay, of both, your being filled with the Spirit will give you <hi>an entrance in abundance into this Kingdom, i. e.</hi> will put you into ſuch a ſtate and condition, wherein you ſhall have a rich taſte, or (rather) plentiful firſt Fruits of the glory and bleſſedneſs of that Kingdom. This entrance in abundance, which we ſpeak of, into the Everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall, by your being filled with the Spirit, be given unto you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, In reſpect of that Righteouſneſs, or Excellency of Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby the Subjects of this Kingdom maintain themſelves in the felicity and enjoyment of it, and whereby they are diſcernable from other perſons. For when, and whileſt the Spirit of God dwelleth richly and plentifully in you, he will kindle and raiſe up ſtrong and excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, Potent and Prince like Reſolutions, within you, unto waies and works of Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs; Inclinations and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions in this kind that will not be baffled, or turned out of the way by every guſt of Temptation; as the Purpoſes and Reſolutions of the ſame Denomination in the generality of Profeſſours in whom the Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in a lower degree only are ſubject to be; but will hold on their courſe in waies of Righteouſneſs. As a good Ship running with all her Sails diſplayed, before a ſtiff Gale of Wind, will cut through the waves and troubleſome workings of the Seas, taking no notice of them: Even ſo, when a man <hi>is filled with the Spirit,</hi> he is, as it were, tied and bound hand and foot, that he cannot lightly move or ſtir out of the waies which the Spirit it ſelf commendeth unto him; and ſeeketh to guide his feet unto. As <hi>Paul</hi> being filled with the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.22. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I now go bound in the Spirit unto Jeruſalem, not knowing the things that ſhall befall me there. I go bound in the Spirit:</hi> That is, the Spirit of God hath wrought ſuch a mighty Deſire, and Reſolution in me to go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that my Mind and Conſcience will not ſerve me ſo much as to deliberate, or argue the caſe within me, whether I had beſt to go, or no. As a man that is bound hand and foot, where and in what poſture you leave him, there you ſhall find him; eſpecially, if his bands be ſtrong, and cloſe drawn, and faſt tied, they will keep him from motion. In like manner, he that is filled with the Spirit is much in the ſame caſe or condition ſpiritually; he cannot act or move, but only as
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95016:143"/>the Spirit acteth and moveth him. When the Apoſtles were <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (as they were in the day of <hi>Pentecoſt, Acts</hi> 2.4.) they could not ſpeak what they pleaſed or liſted: but (ſaith the Text) <hi>they began to ſpeak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance,</hi> they were bound in the Spirit from ſpeaking, <hi>viz.</hi> from ſpeaking any thing but what the Spirit pleaſed. As <hi>Paul</hi> was not bound in the Spirit from doing any thing, or going any where at all, but from going any whither but to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was the place the Spirit moved him to go unto: In like manner, when men and women are filled with the Spirit (in the ſenſe of the Text in hand) they are inwardly bound and ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from walking or moving in all other waies, ſave only thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are guided by himſelf, which are only waies of Rigteouſneſs and Holineſs. Now then, to walk in waies of Righteouſneſs, to walk uniformly, conſtantly, and only in theſe waies (I mean, without any ſcandalous or ſelf-allowed deviation) this muſt needs be conceived to be an <hi>entrance in abundance into the Everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in reſpect of the Righteouſneſs of it. Now to be at this paſs that we ſhall not only walk in waies of Righteouſneſs, but to do it without any manner of regret; nay, without much noiſe, ſtriving, or reluctancy from our hearts, or from our fleſh within us. This is one of the firſt born of Priviledges; and, my Brethren, if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in being filled with the Spirit but this only, <hi>viz.</hi> that you ſhall be enabled hereby to walk after an excellent rate, to keep the very Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Heaven, to walk holily, and humbly with your God by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of righteouſneſs, and to ſhine in the beauty of Holineſs whilſt you live, is a matter that would make it worthy your labour, and of all that can be required of you to poſſeſs your ſouls with it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> By your being filled with the Spirit (in the ſenſe declared) you ſhall find an entrance in abundance into the ſaid Kingdom, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the peace thereof: in this Kingdom of Chriſt, as there is, and ſhall be an abundance of Righteouſneſs, ſo ſhall there be an abundance of Peace alſo: <hi>Abundance of Peace</hi> (ſaith <hi>David,</hi> ſpeaking of this Kingdom) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.7. <hi>As long as the Moon endureth</hi> there ſhall be <hi>abundance of Peace, i. e.</hi> there ſhall be no interruption, no breaches at all, greater or leſſer, made upon the tranquillity and peace of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Kingdom; according to that Propheſie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.25. <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy</hi> [<hi>i. e</hi> none ſhall hurt, neither men, nor any other Creature ſhall ſo much as hurt, or offer the leaſt diſturbance unto any, much leſs ſhall they deſtroy] <hi>in all my holy mountain</hi> (he ſpeaks of that Mountain which ſhall fill the whole earth when the time cometh, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.35.) This is that everlaſting Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. Now that abundance of peace which <hi>David</hi> Propheſied ſhould be enjoyed in this Kingdom, comprehendeth as well, yea, and chiefly that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace which ſhall be eſtabliſhed, ratified, and confirmed between
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:95016:144"/>God and them, and enjoyed accordingly by them, as alſo the external peace which they ſhall enjoy too. So then when we undertake to ſay unto you, that if you ſhall be filled with the Spirit, you ſhall have by this means an entrance in abundance into the everlaſting Kingdom of the Lord Chriſt, in reſpect of the peace hereof; our meaning is, that you ſhall enjoy an excellent degree of heavenly and inward tranquillity; you ſhall be delivered from thoſe ſecret wringings, and gripings, and gnawings of Conſcience, for fear of the wrath that is to come, whereunto they who neglect to ſteer this courſe we ſpeak of, to be filled with the Spirit, and whoſe enjoyments in this kind are but low, are ever and anon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto; you ſhall not lye under any Jealouſie of God, as if his heart and ſoul were not perfect with you, or as if there were ſome Item given of diſpleaſure againſt you. <hi>The peace of God</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>paſſeth all underſtanding:</hi> that is, the worth and value, the riches of it amounteth to more in the true nature and eſtimate of it than any mans underſtanding is able to ſum or caſt up, or to comprehend or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. A man's underſtanding can go a great way, and what it can conceive is of a vaſt extenſion; yet, ſaith he, peace with God is ſuch a thing, the richneſs of it is ſo unſearchable, that the underſtanding of a man cannot value it; though it ſhould ſtrain it ſelf, and make a work of it, yet this peace of God cannot be conceived by it. Now, I ſay, this peace of God ſhall be veſted in your ſouls; and though this peace will not (it may be) ſo reconcile the World unto you, but that you may have wars and troubles from it; yet it will do that which will be (upon the matter) equivalent hereunto; it will bring it ſo to paſs with you, that (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9, 10. you ſhall be able <hi>to rejoyce in your infirmities, i. e.</hi> in ſuch things which you ſhall ſuffer from the World; and to do as <hi>James</hi> adviſeth Chriſtians, <hi>To count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations,</hi> Jam. 1.2. Now wars and troubles upon theſe terms are every whit as good, as deſirable as peace it ſelf; but we ſpake more largely in the former particular. But now that by <hi>being filled with the Spirit,</hi> your peace with God muſt needs advance and become glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, may be made to appear from theſe two Conſiderations (both of them near at hand.) Firſt, By this means, by being filled with the Spirit, thoſe things which are apt and likely to interrupt and diſturbe your peace with God, yea, which only (according to ordinary experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) are able to bring this inconveniency or miſery upon you, will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thoſe things which are apt and proper to nouriſh, to add growth and ſtrength to your peace with God, will abundantly ſucceed in their place, and by both theſe you ſhall have your peace with God in abundance. Firſt (I ſay) by your being filled with the Spirit, thoſe things which are like to interrupt, or make any breach upon your peace with God will be cut off; and taken out of the way; this we know is
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95016:144"/>ſin, and unworthineſs of Life and Converſation; <hi>There is no peace ſaith my God to the wicked,</hi> Iſa. 57.21. &amp; 48.22. And again, <hi>Your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have ſeparated between you nnd your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you.</hi> When God ſaith, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked:</hi> And again, That <hi>mens Iniquities ſeparate between him and them,</hi> he plainly enough implieth, that there is peace to all that are not wicked; and that there is nothing of a ſeparating and dividing nature between God and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Man but Iniquity; that nothing will cauſe God to hide his face from man but ſin.</p>
               <p>The reaſon hereof is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe there is nothing that hath any contrariety to the nature of God, nothing that is provoking to him but Iniquity only: All other things have a perfect ſympathy and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his nature, as being made by him. Therefore there is nothing in the World that can provoke God unto Anger, or that can make him to come out in any warlike manner againſt his Creature but only ſin. Who will make War with his Friends? Or will ſuffer it to come into all his thoughts to have any hard or cruel device againſt them? Will a man quarrel and fight with his own Child whilſt he is dutiful to him, and gives him no cauſe of trouble?</p>
               <p>So then thoſe things which cauſe Iniquity to ceaſe from the Creature, that which ſeparates between ſin and it, muſt needs cauſe all that to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the way which is any waies interruptive of our peace with God. It hath been been formerly ſhewed, and proved in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Doctrine, and was even now briefly hinted (repetition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) that a being <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> will leave no place in the heart or ſoul of a man for the Luſts of the Fleſh, for vile and ſinful Luſts to lodge there: And if theſe be diſſolved, and aboliſhed out of the ſoul, the fruits of them, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſinful and wicked actions and waies muſt needs be cut off alſo; becauſe <hi>as the ruſh cannot grow without water:</hi> So neither can the fruits of the fleſh grow, but from the Luſts of the fleſh. So that this will be the conſequence of being filled with the Spirit, That all thoſe things which make any breach between God and you ſhall be removed. Where no fuell is, the fire goeth out: So where there is <hi>no tale-bearer, ſtrife ceaſeth.</hi> Now that which fuel is to the fire, and a talebearer to cauſe ſtrife; the ſame is ſinfulneſs in the Creature, it is obſtructive to its peace with God, and kindles the fire of his diſpleaſure againſt it: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the fuel from the fire, and it will go out of it ſelf; Even ſo, do but remove ſin from the ſight of God, and the fire of his Diſpleaſure and Anger will go out, and extinguiſh of themſelves. Where ſin and unrighteouſneſs tell no tales unto God, and make no complaint in his ears, there ſtrife ceaſeth, and all his thoughts towards you will be love and peace.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By your being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> as all things hereby will be taken out of the way which are likely to obſtruct your peace with
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95016:145"/>God; So likewiſe all thoſe things which are moſt proper to nouriſh and advance your peace with him will abound in you. If you ſhall ask me, What are theſe? I anſwer, They are the fruits of righteouſneſs and true holineſs, eſpecially when they ſhall abound, and advance in the Lives and Converſations of men. Like the Waves of the Sea, when one Wave drives on another; So when one Act of righteouſneſs and holineſs ſhall follow in the neck of another, and when they ſhall encreaſe, and riſe higher and higher, there will be all things in being that are apt and proper to feed, nouriſh, and maintain the moſt ſolid peace in the breaſt of men towards God. And theſe things are moſt apt and proper to create peace, perfect peace for men in the breaſt of God, and ſuffer no touch or tincture of any diſpleaſure to reſt there; For as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. that <hi>perfect love caſteth out fear</hi> [namely, out of the hearts of men:] So doth an excellent ſtrein of righteouſneſs, or perfection in men, caſt all thoughts of War, Enmity, or Oppoſition unto men out of the heart of God. In the ſecond place, As theſe things being in men, <hi>viz.</hi> waies and works of righteouſneſs, eſpecially (as was even now ſaid) when they abound, clear and rid the heart and ſoul of God from all Enmity, and hard intentions towards his Creatures, men or women; So doth the ſenſe and conſciouſneſs of theſe things in men themſelves introduce and bring into their ſouls the ſenſe and fruits of this bleſſed poſture of ſoul towards them. This createth a clear and ſtrong apprehenſion in them that things are ſo, and ſo according to their hearts deſire, they know there is no touch of any fire of diſpleaſure againſt them. The clear, pregnant, and lively teſtimony of a man's Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that he doth work righteouſneſs, eſpecially, that he abounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, cannot (lightly) but make him to be a man of a ſerene Spirit, and one that fears no colours from heaven. And if one ſtrein of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only, <hi>viz. Mercy</hi> (as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>rejoyceth againſt Judgment, i. e.</hi> magnifieth it ſelf, doth not fear, is not ſubject to fear that God ſhould ſet himſelf at any time againſt the merciful man; the very nature of this Mercy rejoyceth againſt Judgment. Now then, if it be ſo, that one vein of righteouſneſs hath ſuch a mighty Spirit in this kind to enable a man to <hi>rejoyce againſt judgment;</hi> How much more when there ſhall be a confluence, or meeting together of all the waies and ſtreins of righteouſneſs in the whole courſe of a mans life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation? If righteouſneſs with the little finger be able to do ſo much, how much more can the whole body do when it is in all its ſtrength and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? This muſt needs advance the Soul of a man in aſſurance that all is well between God and him, (as <hi>John</hi> ſaith in the place even now hinted at upon a like occaſion) <hi>Perfect love caſteth out fear;</hi> becauſe Love is of that nature, that a man cannot, when he doth love another, and withal knoweth that ſuch a man knows that he loves him, be under any fear of receiving any hurt from him. Upon this ground it is that the Apoſtle
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95016:145"/>ſaith, that <hi>perfect love caſteth out fear,</hi> becauſe a man knows that God is privy to the ſtate of his heart, and knoweth whether he love him, or no. If I know certainly that I love ſuch, or ſuch a man, and withal know, that he knows that I do love him, and wiſh well unto him, it is impoſſible that I ſhould be afraid of this man, in as much as I know that he hath a full aſſurance of my good, real, and cordial affection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Now how can I fear, or be jealous that he ſhould ſeek my hurt or ruine? A man's Friend is part of himſelf, and a man cannot but ſeek his own good and peace. As no man ever hated his own fleſh: So certainly no man ever yet hated his Friend, whom he certainly knew to be his Friend, for (as I ſaid) he is even as himſelf. In like manner, it is impoſſible but that a lively ſenſe and conſciouſneſs of that love which a man beareth unto God muſt needs raiſe a mighty, glorious, and triumphant confidence in the ſoul that all things are right and ſtraight between God and him; that his intereſt is perfect, whole and entire with him, and that there remaineth not ſo much as the leaſt ſpark of the fire of anger there.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) by being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> you will have <hi>an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance alſo in abundance into the Everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in reſpect of the joy thereof. Peace importeth freedom, or exemption from troubles and diſturbances: But joy impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the inward, and high ſatisfaction, pleaſure, or contentment of mind, which is created, or raiſed in the Soul by the apprehenſion and conſideration of the excellent goodneſs of this peace, together with the ſweet Priviledges and Enjoyments of this <hi>Kingdom.</hi> Now this joy we ſpeak of, the joy of the Everlaſting Kingdom of Chriſt, muſt needs be (according to that Character which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> gives of it, which is a taſte, or firſt fruits of that Kingdom) <hi>unſpeakable, and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe there ſhall be ſuch a mighty, and ſuch an incredible abundance of all deſirable and precious things, both to raiſe and to maintain this joy, which will certainly meet together, in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> in that ſtate and condition which the Saints ſhall be brought unto, when the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall be ſet up in the World. <hi>All Lebanon</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Iſa.</hi> 40.16.) <hi>is not ſufficient to burn, nor the beaſts thereof ſufficient for a burnt offering.</hi> If all the wood that grew in <hi>Lebanon</hi> (at leaſt that did grow in his daies) were cut down; and one fire made of it all, How exceeding great above meaſure would this fire, and flame, and burning be? Now God will ſummon (as it were) the whole Creation together; He will call to the Heavens, to the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and all the Hoſts of them; He will call to the North, and to the South, to the Eaſt, and to the Weſt; He will call to the Seas, and to the deep places; He will call to the Beaſts of the Field, and to the Fowls of Heaven to bring in whatſoever they have in their Treaſure or keeping, and which will contribute any
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:95016:146"/>thing towards the making of the joy of the Kingdom we ſpeak of like unto a joy prepared by the infinite magnificence and bounty of the God of Heaven, on purpoſe to ſhew his glory and power for his Sons and Daughters, and thoſe that have ſerved him. How exceeding great then above meaſure muſt this joy needs be? That he will do no leſs, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much more than yet hath been ſpoken of for the perſons mentioned, He hath given a ſufficient aſſurance in the gift of his Son Jeſus Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, according to the expreſs tenour of the Apoſtles reaſoning, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8.32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things?</hi> The ſtrength of the Apoſtles arguing lieth in ſome ſuch Principle, or Notion as this, <hi>viz.</hi> That no man of underſtanding, and that is Maſter of his Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or undertakings, will lay a foundation larger, or wider, or richer than the nature of what he intends by way of ſuperſtructure doth require: Such a thing as this would render his work or building diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and uncomely, and indeed ridiculous, if the Foundation do palpably and notoriouſly exceed the proportion and ſcantling of his Building. From this Principle we may (with the Apoſtle) with the greateſt confidence and aſſurance of heart and ſoul under Heaven con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That in as much as God hath laid the foundation of the joy and happineſs of thoſe who ſhall love, and believe on him, ſo large and rich as he hath done in the gift of his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt to die for them, that he will build upon it anſwerably, and conſequently raiſe the Fabrick of their bleſſedneſs and glory to the greateſt height, and and magnificence by all means, by any thing that any where can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to advance it: otherwiſe his <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> would not agree. So then this is that we ſay, That if you ſhall be <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> you ſhall have an <hi>entrance in abundance</hi> into this abundant joy we ſpeak of, The joy of the Everlaſting Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt. There is an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, and an entrance in abundance, as into the two former of thoſe vaſt Priviledges of this Kingdom, <hi>viz.</hi> Righteouſneſs, and Peace, ſo alſo into this third Priviledge of the Joy thereof. An entrance ſimply into this joy, implies only ſome kind of lighter taſte thereof, leſs affecting the ſoul. An entrance in abundance noteth ſuch a ſtate or condition wherin a man or woman ſhall be poſſeſſed of a good or Rich Proportion of this Joy, <hi>viz.</hi> of a third or fourth part of it; by means of which he ſhall find, and feel, and enjoy within himſelf, to his own content, and in his own ſight as good and happy an eſtate and condition (upon the matter) as he would judge himſelf to be in, in caſe he were actually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with ſuch a Kingdom, and with the felicity and joy thereof; the joy we ſpeak of being of the ſame kind with that of the <hi>Everlaſting Kingdom</hi> of Chriſt, but only ſhort in ſome degrees of it. As a man whoſe eſtate is worth one thouſand pounds by the year hath ſomewhat of the ſame ſatisfaction and contentment of him that hath four or five
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:95016:146"/>thouſand pounds; I mean, when as well the one as the other knoweth how to take ſatisfaction in their eſtates (reſpectively) and neither more or leſs than what they are competent, and proper to afford unto them.</p>
               <p>Now that your being <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> muſt needs give you ſuch an <hi>entrance in abundance</hi> (as hath been deſcribed) into the joy of the <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> may be well conceived (by what hath already been delivered) after ſuch a manner as this; the joy of this <hi>Kingdom</hi> is, the higheſt and moſt contentful reſult in the ſoul of all thoſe particular bleſſings, and vouchſafements, in the poſſeſſion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment whereof the happineſs of it conſiſteth: The ſenſe of the rich goodneſs, and commodiouſneſs of thoſe things, being enjoyed upon ſuch terms as they will be in that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and known ſo to be, is either formally, or efficiently the joy thereof. So then, whatſoever createth a lively ſenſe in the heart and ſoul of a man of the tranſcendent goodneſs and ſweetneſs of thoſe enjoyments muſt needs give an entrance in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance into the joy thereof: This, a <hi>being filled with the Spirit,</hi> muſt needs do, becauſe it cannot but fill you with a confident hope and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt expectation to enjoy them in due time. In this I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imply one thing, and affirm another: The thing I plainly affirm lieth naked, or open in the words themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> that a <hi>being filled with the Spirit</hi> muſt needs fill men with a confident hope and expectation to enjoy theſe things in due time: The thing I ſuppoſe is, That a confident hope, and rich ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to enjoy theſe things in due time muſt needs give men an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in abundance</hi> into that joy which we are ſpeaking of, ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance in this kind as hath been deſcribed.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is evident from what was argued when we ſhewed, and proved unto you, That your being filled with the Spirit will not ſuffer you to be idle and unprofitable in the Knowledge and Profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, but will cauſe you to abound in the fruits of righteouſneſs and true holineſs: And ſecondly, that ſuch an abounding as this muſt needs raiſe an abundant confidence or aſſurance in the love and favour of God; and conſequently, an aſſurance of enjoying all that is to be enjoyed in the Everlaſting Kingdom of his dear Son: So that we ſhall not need to inſiſt upon the proof hereof any further. Therefore ſecondly, whereas I ſuppoſe that an abundant confidence, or aſſurance and expectation of enjoying the great things of Chriſt's Kingdom in due time muſt needs amount to as much as this, or produce at preſent ſuch an <hi>entrance in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> into the joy of this Ringdom as that lately deſcribed: The truth hereof may be conceived upon this account. The confident hope, and earneſt expectation of enjoying things in time, which when they come to be actually enjoyed will be found to be exceeding great, and yielding much ſatifaction, and joy, and are known to be ſuch, whileſt they are yet only hoped, and expected, is, and muſt needs be ſuch an entrance into them as <hi>Peter</hi> calls <hi>abundant</hi> (in the ſenſe we have given.) Such an
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95016:147"/>hope, and expectation as we ſpeak of, is a kind or degree of enjoyment of the things themſelves, and may (in propriety of ſpeech, and with truth enough) be ſimply termed an enjoyment of them. As ſhe that is betro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hed or eſpouſed to an Husband may truly and properly enough be termed a Wife: So, he that is under a pregnant and lively hope of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying ſuch and ſuch things may be ſaid, by means of ſuch his hope, to enjoy them. Now you ſhall ſee that the Scripture uſeth thus to ſpeak, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. <hi>For we are ſaved by hope;</hi> that is, that hope which we have of being ſaved, it is ſo full that we are already ſaved by it. And ſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance</hi> [or rather the <hi>ſubſiſtence,</hi> for ſo <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſis</hi> ſignifies] <hi>of things hoped for.</hi> Faith is ſaid to be the ſubſiſtence or exiſtence of things hoped for, becauſe the belief of thoſe grounds, or of thoſe Promiſes of God, or declarations that come from Heaven, That Theſe and theſe things ſhall be given to thoſe that believe, this (I ſay) doth give a kind of exiſtency, and preſentiality unto the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the minds, and ſpirits, and ſouls of men. For it is Faith that is the ground work, or that which giveth a ſubſiſtence to theſe things in the ſoul; for Hope floweth from Faith, and by it the heart is carried out to the expectation of them: Hope doth dilate and open the heart, as a man doth his hand to receive that which is ready to be given unto him. But that which giveth life, breath, and being unto Hope, that is Faith: It is Faith that giveth Being unto the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God in his Promiſes and Declarations, by which they are ſettled, and ſecured that they are all valid; and that God will make them good unto his Sons and Daughters (thoſe who ſhall believe.) And in this reſpect the Language or manner of the Scripture ſpeaking is very remarkable, That they who are enabled by God (by being anointed with a Spirit of Revelation) to put men into a ſteady and ſubſtantial hope of poſſeſſing and enjoying ſuch and ſuch things, are ſaid to give them the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1, 2, 3. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted,</hi> &amp;c. So again, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>To give them beauty for aſhes, the Oyl of joy for mourning, the garment of praiſe for the ſpirit of heavineſs,</hi> &amp;c. So that (according to this manner of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaking) becauſe the Prophet offered, by a ſpirit of Prophecy, to fill theis hearts with the hope and expectations of theſe things, he is ſaid to give them the things themſelves. So again, he that ſhall be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the hand of God, to preach the Word of God with ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of truth and demonſtration as that he fills the hearts of men full of the hope of Salvation, is ſaid actually to ſave them. <hi>Take heed unto thy ſelf</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi>) <hi>and unto the Doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this, thou ſhalt both ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> Your being <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> will cauſe God to take a
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:95016:147"/>holy pleaſure and delight in you, and to imploy you about many acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſervices of his, which will be very honourable unto you, and turn to a bleffed account in due time in his <hi>Kingdom. Wherefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle to the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) <hi>look ye out among you ſeven men of honeſt report, full of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. Which doth imply, that the men that God ſeeketh, for the acting and doing his buſineſs here in the World, are ſuch who are full of the Holy Ghoſt, ſuch who have a rich anointing of the Spirit of God. Men that are filled with the Spirit will be vigorous, active, and free in their work; they will do what they do with all their might. As men delight to be ſerved by ſuch Servants who are diligent, and will go through ſtitch with their buſineſs, that will not be baffled, or turned out of their way by every toy or trivial occaſion that ſhall preſent it ſelf, but will go on with their buſineſs not with trifling: Even ſo it is a ſpecial Principle in the living God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſervants that will be faithful, and fervent in their buſineſs. This (indeed) is the very Nature and Being of God, and therefore he put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that Character of his Being upon men which he judgeth meet to be choſen as inſtruments to ſerve him, and which are (as I may ſay) made for him fitly qualified for any work or employment that ſhall be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands. <hi>Who counted me faithful</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>putting me into the Miniſtry.</hi> If <hi>Paul</hi> had not been the man he was, a man of mettle, courage, and reſolution, God would not have delighted in his ſervice, ſo as to have put him into the Miniſtry. Now where we do not ſee men that are in the Miniſtry of the ſame Spirit, it is a ſign they are not put here by God; for God taketh no delight or pleaſure but only in ſuch who are fitted for his work. We read (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21.) of Veſſels pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and made fit for the Maſters uſe; ſo that there is a certain fitneſs, as well in Perſons as in Veſſels, which maketh them meet for ſuch or ſuch reſpective uſes. Now that Generation of men in the World that are <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> are only meet for the Maſters uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Great Maſter of the World, the Lord of Hoſts: Such men as theſe, men who are through-hearted, zealous, and lovers of his Work, and that take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in being employed in his Service, are Veſſels of pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light unto him. <hi>Seeſt thou a man</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>diligent in his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſhall ſtand before Kings,</hi> Prov. 22.29. <hi>Shall ſtand before Kings,</hi> [namely, to miniſter unto them:] Men of this Character are only meet for their Service: Even ſo none are fit for the Service of the Great God of Heaven and Earth but ſuch men who are of active and vigorous ſpirits, and that know how to manage his Affairs with diligence, and faithfulneſs for his intereſt in the World. Theſe men ſhall not ſtand idle, but God will take delight to make uſe of them in his Service: Whereas men that are unqualified for his Service to any confiderable degree (as all men are who art not filled with the Spirit) who have no activity, nor edge in them, are unto God as a bottle in the ſmoak. And as men
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95016:148"/>do not love to put what they drink into bottles that are ſmoaky, becauſe that will deſtroy all the goodneſs and pleaſantneſs of the taſte of that which ſhall be put into them: Even ſo (as was but now hinted) men that are unqualified, that have no dexterity for his buſineſs, theſe are perſons in whom God taketh no pleaſure, but are unto him as a bottle in the ſmoak, becauſe the management of his Affairs by ſuch men as theſe will rather be a diſparagement unto him, than any matter of glory, by rendring his Sacred Things common, and conſequently rendring them deſpicable in the eyes of men. But on the contrary, men that are richly anointed, and filled with his Spirit, theſe are Agents and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for him; as the Sword of <hi>Goliah</hi> was unto <hi>David,</hi> there was none like unto it. There is no Generation of men under Heaven that he taketh ſuch pleaſure in, to commit and intruſt his Affairs withal, as with theſe who are filled with the Spirit. <hi>Who maketh his Angels Spirits</hi> [or wind] <hi>and his Miniſters a flame of fire. Heb.</hi> 1.7. Some (by the way) underſtand the meaning of the place to be only this, That the Apoſtle would hereby ſhew, or prove, that there is no great matter in the name of an Angel, becauſe that God ſometimes calleth the wind by the name of an Angel; and that the Argument in hand was not to prove the tranſcendent excellency of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, above the Angels, and their dignity, but becauſe that the name of Angel is a term of no great dignity, becauſe ſometimes God calleth the Wind An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel or Miniſter. Whether this their Notion will ſtand or no it is not much material, as to that which I ſhall commend unto you for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: For if God call the Wind by name of Angel, or the Fire his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, it is a ſign that he doth delight to make thoſe his Meſſengers that are moſt active, and full of Spirit in their way, for ſo are the Winds, and Flames of Fire. And ſo are Angels, ſtrong and ſwift like unto the Wind, and zealous in their way like Fire, and conſequently every way meet, and accommodated for the Service of the Great God. In like manner, by your being filled with the Spirit this high Priviledge will certainly accrue unto you, That your ſtanding on Earth will be much like the ſtanding of the Angels in Heaven, who continually ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and attend upon him for a beck to be appointed to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſervices, and to be ſent, one one way, and another another way; and happy are they to whom the favour is vouchſafed to have the firſt charge and direction from God about his buſineſs. And ſuch ſhall be your poſture and ſtanding before the God of all the Earth, if you be men and women <hi>filled with the Spirit:</hi> It will not be long ere you ſhall have ſome great and high imployment put into your hands, that will be very beneficial, and honourable unto you, and in which you will take abundance of pleaſure and ſatisfaction.</p>

We all know that there is a kind of natural averſeneſs, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſedneſs in the fleſh of men, unto many Services of God, eſpecially, unto thoſe which are moſt honourable, and moſt worthy of Chriſtians; I ſay, there is a kind of liſtleſsneſs, and hanging back of the Fleſh unto ſuch duties as theſe we are ſpeaking of, which is occaſioned by nothing elſe but only by their diſproportion which they have with men. There is ſomething in the heart of a man which doth not anſwer to ſomething in the Work and Service. Now then, by your being filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, this diſproportion which lieth between your hearts and this Service of God will be taken out of the way. You know the ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>For the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit againſt the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo that ye cannot do the things that ye would</hi> (in the Original it is, that ye may not do the things that ye would. The Spirit luſteth, and by means of the Spirits luſting you are put into a ſtrait, ſo that now ye cannot [or ye may not] do what ye would. This luſting of the Spirit againſt the Fleſh will be a means to weaken the Luſtings of the Fleſh, ſo that you will have no deſire to do thoſe things which you are naturally enclined unto. And if the Spirit be ſtrong in the ſoul of a man, theſe Luſtings of the Spirit will be ſtrong alſo; yea, they will (if they be not obſtructed in their way) advance, and grow ſtronger, until all the Luſtings of the fleſh be ſubdued, and all diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and inclinations unto ſin (upon the matter) wholly cut off; ſo that you will not find your ſelves under any Obligations to walk in any ſuch waies wherein the fleſh may be gratified. Your being <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> will free you from all incumbrances in the waies of holineſs. And you ſhall come forth unto ſuch waies as theſe, Like the Sun, <hi>which</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) <hi>is as a Bridegroom coming out of his Chamber, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth as a ſtrong man to run a Race,</hi> Pſal. 19.5. Why is the Sun ſaid to rejoyce, and to come forth as <hi>a Bridegroom, and as a Gyant to run his courſe,</hi> but becauſe (though his Courſe be long, above what, will eaſily be believed, ſhould be accompliſhed by him in the ſpace of twenty four hours) he is, if I may ſo ſpeak, naturally conſcious that he hath abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly wherewich to perform it? Such a Courſe or Race to him is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and delightſome. If another Creature not ſo qualified either with figure, ſwiftneſs, Propenſity unto Circular motion, or the like, were to run, I mean, appointed or commanded by God, as the Sun is, to run the ſame Courſe, and were to ſet forth out of the ſame Chamber with the Sun; this Creature would not come forth to his work like a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, but rather like unto him that mourneth, and whoſe Countenance is caſt down unto the Earth. In like manner, when men and women are filled with the Holy Ghoſt, they come forth unto the greateſt actions,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:95016:149"/>or higheſt Services, whether for God, or men, like unto ſo many Bride-grooms out of their Chambers, full of alacrity, and with an heavenly pleaſantneſs of heart and face; as it is ſaid of <hi>Stephen,</hi> who is noted to have been a man filled with the Spirit, that all the Council that looked ſtedfaſtly, or narrowly on him, <hi>ſaw his face as it had been the face of an Angel,</hi> Acts 6.25. <hi>i.e.</hi> did diſcern a more than ordinary, a kind of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Viſage, or compoſure of Countenance in him, wherein an awful gravity, with an heavenly kind of Luſtre or pleaſantneſs were in conjunction; and by the light of this his Angelical and heavenly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, a like heavenly complexion or conſtitution of heart and ſoul within might eaſily have been diſcerned alſo. <hi>Stephen</hi> had a great piece of work, a difficult ſervice upon his hand; he was to give Teſtimony unto Jeſus Chriſt before the Powers of this World, a great Council of men that were deſperate Oppoſers of him, and maliciouſly bent againſt all thoſe that profeſſed him, and to abide all hazards and dangers likely to attend ſuch an engagement: But being filled with the Holy Ghoſt his heart ſweetly and readily comported with the work, as if it had been but like the going to a Feaſt. So alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 20.22, 23, 24. &amp; 21.11. &amp; 13. compared. In the former, <hi>And now behold, I go bound in the Spirit unto Jeruſalem, not knowing the things that ſhall befall me there: Save that the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every City, ſaying, that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of theſe things move me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther count I my life dear unto my ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Now do but compare the latter, <hi>And when he</hi> (Agabus) <hi>was come unto us, he took Paul's Girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and ſaid, Thus ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, ſo ſhall the Jews at Jeruſalem bind the man that oweth this Girdle, and ſhall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</hi> Upon the hearing of theſe things they beſought him not to go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Then anſwered Paul, what mean ye to weep, and to break mine heart? For I am not only ready to be bound, but alſo to die at Jeruſalem for the Name of the Lord Jeſus:</hi> As who ſhould ſay, Are you aware how bleſſed a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs I have in hand, and of how evil a tendency this your advice, and this your weeping is? Why (ſaith he) do ye break my heart? I am all thoughts made in my felf, I have no regret within me as to this ſervice of going to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and therefore why do you by your weeping, as you do, go about to diſſolve and ſcatter that bleſſed and compoſed frame of heart which I have wrought my ſelf unto? For (ſaith he) I have not only a light willingneſs, but I am ſet upon the work whatever it coſt me; I am not only ready to ſuffer ſuch things as Bonds, Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I am even ready to die at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for the Name of the Lord Jeſus; I have reaſons in abundance to balance againſt all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-arguings of my Fleſh, my Friends, and Relations; I have trampled them all under my feet, ſo that I have no more to think of, or to debate what to do in this caſe, but am in an actual readineſs, as to this buſineſs.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:95016:149"/>So then, you ſee that being filled with the Spirit of God how it removeth all obſtructions out of the way of men and women in the Service of God: It cauſeth every thing to ceaſe from being burthenſome or hard unto them. It is with a man or woman that is filled with the Spirit of God in reſpect of their natural indiſpoſitions, or averſneſs to the high and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Services of God, as it is between the inferiour Orbs, or Spheres in the Heavens and that utmoſt Sphere which Philoſophers call <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> the Firſt Mover; the motion of this Sphere (according to the notion they have of it, and probable it is true in reaſon, however, it is very apt and proper to repreſent the buſineſs which we deſire to poſſeſs you with) is ſo incredible ſwift, and ſtrong, that it carries about all the other with it, notwithſtanding their propenſions, and theſe very ſtrong too in their kind, unto different, yea, contrary motions; but that ſame <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Mobile</hi> carries them along with it in its own motion and courſe, taking no notice, <hi>viz.</hi> of any repugnancy in them to ſuch a motion or comportance with it, but carries them about as if they were all agreed, and naturally conſenting to go along with it: Much after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is between a great preſence or fulneſs of the Holy Ghoſt in the ſoul and that natural indiſpoſition or averſeneſs of the Fleſh to waies and ſervices of a difficult and excellent import. The Holy Ghoſt, being glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly potent, and mighty in his motions and way, overbears and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets the natural Propenſions, and the repugnant and croſs inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Fleſh to ſuch ſervices and works, and carries theſe along with him in his courſe, by reaſon whereof they ſeem willing alſo, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to what is done, or to be done in that kind. Or look, as it is between the Tide, or flowing in of the Sea, and the courſe of the River or freſh waters upon which it comes; we know the natural courſe of the River, and the waters thereof, is contrary to the courſe of the Sea, and the waters thereof, when it flows; yet becauſe the Sea moves with more authority, <hi>viz.</hi> with more ſtrength and irreſiſtibleneſs of motion than the River doth, it takes along the waters of the River with it in its courſe, and theſe ſeem to be as willing with the motion as the Sea it ſelf and the waters thereof; nor is there any contrariety, or averſeneſs, or reluctancy to the motion diſcerned in theſe freſh waters whilſt they are under the authority and conduct of the Salt: After ſuch a manner it is between the fleſh of a man and the averſeneſs that is there unto things that are of a ſpiritual nature. When a man is filled with the Spirit of God, this carrieth all down before him, and that after ſuch a manner, as that the Fleſh forgetteth all hardneſs and difficulty that is in its way in the Service of God, and ſo forbears all ſwelling, or riſing up againſt it. This then in the fifth place is another worthy Priviledge that doth attend your being filled with the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Your being filled with the Spirit will enlarge your hearts mightily unto waies and works that are excellent: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> It will make you
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95016:150"/>like unto Jeſus Chriſt in true Nobleneſs, and Prince-like diſpoſition of Spirit; and cauſe you to fall in travel with the World until the peace, comfort, and proſperity of it be provided for, and eſtabliſhed round about you. This accommodation and benefit differs from the former, and carrieth ſomewhat in it above that. That conſiſted in a reconciling, or healing the diſproportion which commonly is between the hearts, or natural diſpoſitions of men and the waies (eſpecially, the more high and excellent waies) of God: This conſiſts in an effectual drawing out of the heart and ſoul unto ſuch waies and ſervices, in ſetting an edge of zeal upon the Spirits of men, to be like unto the Vine in <hi>Jotham's</hi> Parable, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.13. which is there ſaid to chear both God and man. A man may (poſſibly) be free from any great averſeneſs or indiſpoſedneſs to ſuch or ſuch an action or courſe, and yet be but of a kind of neutral and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent frame of heart, have no great or zealous propenſion towards them: But he that is <hi>zealous of good works</hi> (as the Scripture ſpeaks) hath not only the contrariety and averſeneſs of his nature unto ſuch works ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and broken within him; but hath an inclination unto them ſtirred up and wrought in him, ſo that (as a ſtrong Bias in a Boule) his heart leaneth and longeth that way. So then, this is that which I hold forth unto you in the particular now in hand, If you ſhall be <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> you will hereby be enriched with many noble, excellent, and worthy diſpoſitions of heart and ſoul, which will lead and carry you forth with a ſtrong hand upon all occaſions to works and actions of an high and ſacred import: It will relieve you againſt the natural ſcantneſs and narrowneſs of your hearts in this kind; and cauſe you (with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>) to be numbred amongſt the Friends of God, and Benefactors to the World, and no opportunity of doing good ſhall eſcape you: It will cauſe you to look upon your ſelves (with <hi>Paul</hi>) as <hi>Debtors to the Greeks and Barbarians, to the wiſe, and to the unwiſe,</hi> Rom. 1.14. (<hi>i.e.</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all perſons of mankind without exception) and will give you no reſt in your Spirits but only whilſt you are paying what you owe in this kind, or at leaſt preparing and putting your ſelves into a condition to pay accordingly. I began to ſay unto you, that it would make you like unto Jeſus Chriſt himſelf in Prince-likeneſs and true greatneſs of Spirit: it will draw you into part and fellowſhip (and this in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance) in the ſame deſign, and prevail with you to make one purſe, and to caſt in your lot with him; It will give you the conſidence and courage to ſay unto him as <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> ſaid to King <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 Kings 22.4. <hi>I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horſes as thy horſes;</hi> you will joyn with him with all the ſtrength you have, and all the friends and power you can make in the World in that great and bleſſed work and engagement which is now upon his hand, and which he is carrying on day and night; I mean, the advancement of the peace and happineſs of the World. For though particular men and women, and theſe not
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:95016:150"/>many, enjoy the rich benefit and fruit of his moſt gracious interpoſures and actings in that kind we ſpeak of, yet the compaſs of his deſign, to do good, and bleſs, and ſave, and the nature and proper tendency of his actings are as large as the World, or generality of mankind. Hence it is, that in Scripture Language things of general and publick concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are called the things of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in oppoſition to the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of particular men: <hi>All ſeek their own, not the things that are Jeſus Chriſt's,</hi> Phil. 2.21. meaning, that generally mens hearts were ſtraight and narrow, extending themſelves only to their own particular intereſt and concernments, not caring for things of a general and publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; which are properly the Affairs and Concernment of Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Great Providor for the World, who doth good, and bleſſeth particulars as they are members of the Univerſal, and come in his way, <hi>i. e.</hi> as they walk in thoſe wares of Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, whereunto his Deſires and Endeavours are to bring the World, and this in order to their Peace and Happineſs. Now, this great and glorious deſign of bleſſing the World from the one end of it unto the other was raiſed in the ſoul of Jeſus Chriſt by his being <hi>filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> His anointing in this kind was not by meaſure: Hence it came to paſs, that the complexion of his heart and ſoul for doing good was ſo large and comprehenſive to go round about the whole Creation, as is witneſſed of him (<hi>Acts</hi> 10.38.) that <hi>God anointed Jeſus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghoſt, and with power, who went thout doing good, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all that were oppreſſed of the Devil: For God was with him.</hi> Look then, to what degree you ſhall be filled with the ſame Spirit w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> kind, your endeavours and engagements to do good will be very vaſt and comprehenſive; You will not endure to ſee the miſerable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition of men and women in the World in one kind or other, but that you will find or feel ſomething or other in you that will provoke you, yea, and after a manner will compel you to miniſter unto them of what you have in your hand. As whilſt <hi>Paul</hi> ſtaid at <hi>Athens</hi> waiting for <hi>Silas</hi> and <hi>Timotheus, His ſpirit was ſtirred in him, when he ſaw the City wholly given to Idolatry,</hi> Acts 17.16. How, or unto what was his ſpirit ſtirred within him? Doubtleſs, it was to relieve them, by endeavouring to break aſunder (if it were poſſible) that ſnare of death, this humour of Idolatry, wherewith theſe poor people were taken, and ſo to deliver them; as appeareth by that which followeth in <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. <hi>Therefore diſputed he in the Synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout perſons, and in the Market daily with them that met with him.</hi> Thus then you ſee, here is another great and worthy accommodation which a being filled with the Spirit is accompanied with, which will make you like unto Princes, yea, like unto Jeſus Chriſt himſelf: You will be
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:95016:151"/>willing to go along with him, and not ſo much mind, or manage your own things as the things of his intereſt and glory: You will be willing to take Chriſt's deſign along with you, and ſtill watch over that great buſineſs which he is carrying on with an high hand in the World. Now who is able to eſtimate or compute the bleſſedneſs of ſuch a ſtate and frame of heart and ſoul as this is which we now ſpeak of; and which with the Scripture, and evidence of reaſon otherwiſe, we aſcribe to a being <hi>filled with the Spirit?</hi> The loud rejoycing of Conſcience, which doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue unto men, is the natural reſult of ſuch a frame of heart ſo enlarged, and endeavours ſutable unto it. This great and mighty Teſtimony of a man's Conſcience is ſweeter and more deſirable than life it ſelf. And we ſhall find the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> make an eſtimate or value of it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>For it were better for me to die, than that any man ſhould make my glorying void,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.15. From whence this glorying of his did ſpring we are particularly informed from his hand, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is this, the Teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom, but by the grace of God we have had our Converſation in the World,</hi> &amp;c. He had taſted of that ſweetneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable ſatisfaction which did flow in unto him, upon the account of the enlargedneſs of his heart and ſoul in the great concernments of the Goſpel; which made him conclude, that it were better for him to die than that any man ſhould make void his glorying in this kind. How mightily did he magnifie and glory in this great Treaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing in the Teſtimony of his Conſcience, that he had ſerved God and men with all ſincerity and ſimplicity? This he thought was enough to make the World go and do likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> By being filled with the Spirit of God, you ſhall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to pray unto God; and this more effectually, and with greater acceptation, and upon far better terms than any other way, (ſee that known place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27.) <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities: for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought: but the Spirit it ſelf maketh Interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. And he that ſearcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God.</hi> If this be proper to the Spirit ſimply, and where he is in a lower and leſſer degree; then certainly, where there is a greater preſence of God, and where he filleth the hearts and ſouls of men with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, there he riſeth and advanceth in a more excellent manner, with greater accommodations, teaching them how to pray, meaning, the manner how they ſhould pray. Now, in that he is ſaid to relieve our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, and to help our ignorances when we pray; and ſo to teach the Saints to pray as they ought, by making Interceſſion for them; the meaning is, that he teacheth them a prayer of a more excellent, and of a more ſpiritual import, and teacheth them how to preſent this Prayer
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:95016:151"/>of theirs upon terms of a richer and more high acceptation unto God. And <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. it is ſaid, <hi>God hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Alba, Father.</hi> This is a Phraſe or Figure of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, wherein Actions are aſcribed unto thoſe who are the means or cauſe of them, and not to the Actors themſelves: As for inſtance, Charity is ſaid to believe all things, and to hope all things, becauſe it doth qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie and diſpoſe the Perſon where it is found thus to believe all things, and to hope all things: So here the Spirit is ſaid to cry <hi>Abba Father,</hi> and ſo to make interceſſion for the Saints, becauſe he doth teach, enable, and diſpoſe them both to the one and to the other. You had a taſte of that formerly in <hi>Jude</hi> ver. 20. praying in the Holy Ghoſt; that is, by, or through the help and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt. According to the ſame figure our Saviour's Saying unto his Apoſtles is to be underſtood, Mar. 10.20. <hi>For it is not ye that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your Father which ſpeaketh in you.</hi> When they ſhould come before Rulers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, he ſaith it was not they that ſhould ſpeak, but the Holy Ghoſt that was within them; his meaning is, not that the Holy Ghoſt did ſpeak the words, but only becauſe the Holy Ghoſt did furniſh them with ſuch and ſuch things which they ſhould ſpeak: So now, they that be filled with the Spirit of God, there is (as it were) a characteriſtical difference between the ſame kind of actions in them, and that which proceedeth from other men, who have not the ſame edge of ſpirit and life in them; theſe are full of power, and authority, and heavenly luſtre and beauty in their actions and doings; whereas the like actions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of perſons that do them without the Spirit have nothing of excellency in them. Now, of how great and bleſſed a conſequence is it unto you to be enabled to pray effectually, to carry things in Heaven richly, and upon terms of higheſt acceptation? If we could but weigh this one priviledge or advantage alone in the balance, we ſhould find it to weigh more than all the Silver and Gold in the World. What? To be able to pray, yea, to pray unto God with acceptation; to pray ſo as to be able to prevail with God, and that about great matters, for States and Kingdoms; as they may that have an intereſt in Heaven; (as ſuch perſons we ſpeak of have.) Such men might carry the World before them, they might pluck up States and Kingdoms, they might be as great in Heaven, as <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is like we are at ſuch a paſs as the Diſciples were at, when it is ſaid, that they believed not for joy when Chriſt came firſt amongſt them; the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his being roſe again from the dead was a buſineſs of ſuch a mighty conſequence, ſuch a matter of joy, that it became a ſtumbling-block in the way of their faith: They believed not for joy, <hi>i. e.</hi> they were not capable of the moſt demonſtrative Arguments and Convictions
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:95016:152"/>as when he ſhewed them his hands and his feet, and talked with them: This is the caſe of this great Priviledge I ſpeak of, <hi>viz.</hi> of carrying mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Heaven; we are conſcious to our ſelves that we are poor and weak men and women, whom the men of this World are generally ready to to be treading and trampling under foot, and to deſpiſe. Oh, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the things we ſpeak of, How incredible above meaſure are they? Yet it is a moſt certain, and an undoubted truth, that if we be filled with the Spirit of God, we might pray at ſuch a rate, and after ſuch a manner, that we might carry our Petitions in Heaven, and even what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we ſhould ask in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt according to the will of God. And we need have no larger Rule than this, we need not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire a larger Commiſſion than the compaſs of the Will of God; For all things are according to the Will of God which are neceſſary for the comforts and accommodation of men and women in the World round about, <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If you be made great in the Kingdom of Heaven in any other way, or by any other means than that we ſpeak of, you muſt as well be beholding to the ſin and wickedneſs of other men, as to your own worth, grace, or faithfulneſs; and there muſt be more than an ordinary hand in the Providence of God to bring it to paſs: For what other waies or means are there of obtaining a greater preeminence in glory than the generality of the Saints will enjoy (beſides that of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with the Spirit of God, and being drawn out accordingly into
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:95016:152"/>waies and works of excellency and well-doing) unleſs it be by ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Perſecution for the Goſpels ſake; although it might be doubted too, whether ſome good degree of being filled with the Spirit be not requiſite, even to put men into this capacity alſo; For they who have not ſome competent anointing in this kind will hardly hold out in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: That which maketh men conſtant and perſevering under tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and great tribulations to the end, is a certain hope and expectation of a great recompenſe of reward from God, as the Scriptures witneſs in many places which we ſhall not now inſiſt upon. Now, ſuch a hope which will make a man ſtand upright under great Afflictions cannot be raiſed and gotten up into the ſoul but by the reflection of a mans Conſcience up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and witneſſing unto him that he hath walked in waies of a worthy life, and excellent deportment in the World; if then there ſhall be no place for ſuch things as theſe in the ſoul without a being filled with the Spirit of God, which hath been formerly and largely proved, then evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that neither men nor women are likely to be capable of that beſt Reſurrection; and conſequently, not of the beſt Eternity, upon one account or other, without being filled with the Spirit of God. But be it granted, or ſuppoſed, that men may be able deeply to be baptized into ſuffering for righteouſneſs ſake, and ſo become capable of a greater reward in Heaven (as our Saviour ſpeaketh) without being filled with the Spirit of God: Yet, as I was ſaying unto you, this method or way to obtain an eternal greatneſs is more uncertain as to any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, one or other, and leſs within his liberty or power than by an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant fruitfulneſs in well-doing; which (as hath been ſhewed) will not be found in any man without a being filled with the Spirit; nor any man found to be filled with the Spirit without that: For to be called forth and ſtrengthened by God to ſuffer for Chriſt's, or the Goſpels ſake, is matter of peculiar Grace and gift from God; and ſo not in the power of any man himſelf to chuſe; according to that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> Phil. 1.29. <hi>For unto you it is given in the behalf of Chriſt, not only to believe on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake.</hi> This Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Particle, alſo, clearly implieth, that to ſuffer for Chriſt's ſake is not ſo generally granted unto men, as to believe on him is, I mean, is not granted unto all thoſe unto whom it is granted to believe. By ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in this place, I ſuppoſe is meant a ſuffering deeply, and to a more than ordinary degree: Nor is that of the ſame Apoſtle 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hereunto: <hi>Yea, and all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus ſhall ſuffer perſecution, i. e.</hi> ſhall be obnoxious and liable to ſuffer perſecution, or to ſome degree or other actually ſuffer.</p>
               <p>So then, there being no way, at leaſt no way of certainty to heap up theſe Treaſures in Heaven, to lift up your heads on high, and that to Eternity, amongſt thoſe that ſhall be partakers of the ſame glory with you, to enlarge your capacities (reſpectively) for bleſſedneſs and
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:95016:153"/>glory, but by being <hi>filled with the Spirit;</hi>

Mar.</hi> 10.35. that they might be next unto him in greatneſs and in glory: The motion our Saviour ſeemeth to have diſtaſted, as in conſiderately made, and accordingly gave the makers of it this check, <hi>You know not what you ask;</hi> meaning, that they did not underſtand nor conſider how great and excellent, how tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent above meaſure the matter or priviledge was, which they deſired; nor yet conſidered upon what terms, and on what kind of perſons, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the righteous purpoſe and intent of God, it was to be conferred; <hi>It is not mine to give, but to thoſe,</hi> or thoſe only, <hi>for whom it is prepared.</hi> But now, though he checked them in reſpect of their inconſiderateneſs in making the motion, becauſe they underſtood not what they asked, nor knew upon what terms they asked it; for they asked it upon the account of favour and partiality in God, becauſe related unto him as Friends and Followers: Yet otherwiſe he doth not blame them ſimply for deſiring it, but for deſiring it after ſuch a manner, <hi>viz.</hi> carnally. But when he ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 40. it is for them for whom it is prepared: He doth imply, that it is not for two perſons only, but for ſuch perſons that are ſo and ſo qualified. As if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid this on purpoſe, to draw and wind up the hearts of his Creatures men and women to waies of excellent righteouſneſs and holineſs: There ſhall be ſome places of glory higher than other, and they whoſe hearts will ſerve them to come up to my Fathers terms, and quit themſelves like men, in what he expects from them, in righteouſneſs, faithfulneſs, and holineſs, theſe ſhall be the perſons. He doth not blame them ſimply for deſiring theſe high ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations in heaven, but rather enciteth and encourageth them to quit themſelves at ſuch a rate of worth and excellency whilſt they lived, that they might be found thoſe perſons indeed for whom they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and ſo be inveſted with them. My Brethren, the right hand and the left hand of Jeſus Chriſt in his Kingdom, of all deſirable things they are moſt deſirable. The Miniſtration of the Law, the Apoſtle plainly informeth us, was glorious, and yet affirms withal the Miniſtration of the Goſpel to be much more glorious: Yea, though the former Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law in ſimple conſideration be glorious, yet comparatively it was not glorious: So my Brethren, we might very well have ſome ſuch kind of notion, that all Believers are bleſſed, all are glorious; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs in reſpect of thoſe that ſhall be ſuperabundantly bleſſed and glorious, the others glory ſhall be but little in compariſon. <hi>There is one glory of the Sun, and another glory of the Moon, and another glory of the Stars, and theſe differ one from another in glory;</hi> even ſo ſhall it be in reſpect of the glory of the Saints.</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:95016:153"/>
               <p>Now, Who is there but would be willing, eſpecially, by waies that be honourable and worthy, and withal are not difficult, to better his eſtate and condition in the World that now is, though what improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſoever he ſhall make in this kind, he is not like to enjoy but for a ſhort ſeaſon, here being no enduring ſubſtance? Suppoſe he be in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent way of ſubſiſtence at preſent; as ſuppoſe he be worth a hundred pounds, or two, or three <hi>per Annum,</hi> if there were a way opened to double, or treble it, will he not do it? If this be counted wiſdom to advance a periſhing and contemptible ſtate, who would not amongſt us all labour to advance in ſuch a glorious and durable ſtate as we ſpeak of? This then is the firſt thing requiſite to be done in order to your being filled with the Spirit of God; namely, to fill your Judgments and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings with the knowledge of all the excellent and deſirable things of it, together with a frequent and an effectual conſideration of theſe moſt worthy and rich accommodations, which muſt needs accrue or grow unto you by your being filled with the Spirit of God.</p>

               <p>A Second thing to be done, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> to fill your hearts and ſouls with the Spirit of God, is to employ and make uſe of him, upon all your ſpiritual occaſions, and for the performance of duties: When you ſhall at any time apply your ſelves unto God, to do it by him: as in your Prayers unto God; and ſo your mortifying the deeds of the fleſh; and in ſearching out the deep things of God; and in keeping in mind the things of God, and of your own peace. Now, as touching theſe four particulars mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer, Mortification, underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Myſteries, and keeping in mind theſe things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Scriptures do plainly hold forth the uſe and neceſſity of the Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing employed in all theſe, chiefly, and more eſpecially than in other ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Services.</p>
               <p>But here three Queſtions may be propounded; Firſt, Whether we can, or whether it be in our power to engage the Spirit of God in this kind? Whether it be in the reach or power of a man to draw him into part or fellowſhip with us in ſuch ſpiritual works as lie upon our hands to do?</p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:95016:154"/>
               <p>Secondly, How, or by what means, we may engage him?</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) In caſe we ſhall be able to engage him, and ſhall actually do it; how the things that ſhall be thus done by the Spirit in us, ſo engaged, can be attributed unto us, or we looked upon as the doers of them?</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, Whether it be in our power thus to draw in the Spirit of God to ſtand by us, to ſtand at our right hand, and to be help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto us in our ſpiritual Services? To this we anſwer in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: We are able, and may do it, otherwiſe himſelf would not ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have admoniſhed and called upon us to do it; I mean, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him, or to do things of ſeveral kinds by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. <hi>For if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> This Clauſe <hi>(but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body)</hi> containeth and implieth more than an Exhortation or Charge to ſet the Spirit on work to mortifie the deeds of the body. For it containeth a Reaſon to preſs ſuch an Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, drawn from the excellent benefit and advantage that doth attend it, Life Eternal; you ſhall live if you do it. <hi>Seneca</hi> hath a Saying, <hi>Rogat &amp; quidem efficaciſſimè, qui profert rogandi cauſas:</hi> He asketh, and that moſt effectually, who expreſſeth reaſons why he ſhould ask; ſo we may truly and pertinently ſay, when the Holy Choſt delivereth unto us reaſons or motives, whether one or more, why we ſhould be exhorted to ſuch and ſuch duties, he doth incluſively exhort us hereunto, and this after the moſt peircing and effectual manner. Telling and promiſing us, that if we ſhall mortifie the deeds of the fleſh we ſhall live, doth he not moſt affectionately excite and ſtir us up to mortifie them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly? Now we cannot mortifie them by the Spirit, but by prevailing with the Spirit in one kind or other to mortifie them. Thus alſo <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 20. <hi>But ye, Beloved, building up your ſelves in your moſt holy Faith, praying in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> that is, in, or by, or through the help and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt; meaning, that they ſhould do that which they well enough underſtood and knew would prevail with the Holy Ghoſt to aſſiſt and help them in praying. So again, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>That good thing which was committed unto thee</hi> (ſpeaking of that Pattern of wholſome words and ſayings of the Doctrine of the Goſpel) <hi>keep by the Holy Ghoſt which dwelleth in us.</hi> He addeth theſe laſt words, <hi>which dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in us,</hi> to put <hi>Timothy</hi> in mind that the Holy Ghoſt was near at hand ready and offering himſelf to be imployed by Chriſtians in all the great, difficult, and worthy occaſions of their ſouls; and conſequently, to encourage him to addreſs himſelf unto him (I mean, the Holy Ghoſt) that he would enable him to keep, <hi>i. e.</hi> to preſerve in memory and mind the good things he ſpeaketh of. To theſe places I ſhall only add <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16. <hi>This I ſay then, walk in the Spirit and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh. Walk in the Spirit,</hi> I ſuppoſe his meaning is not in
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:95016:154"/>this Phraſe, that they ſhould walk according to the direction and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Spirit, which in <hi>ver.</hi> 18, and elſewhere he calleth a being led by the Spirit; but that they ſhould walk thus by the ſtrength, or by the excitations, and quicknings, or actuations of the Spirit; that they ſhould walk (as it were) on the Legs of the Spirit, ſo that he may carry them out to all they do, and ſo interpoſe likewiſe in their doing it, that the burthen and ſtreſs of the work may lie chiefly upon him, and that men themſelves may taſte little of the difficulty, bardneſs, or offenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if any ſuch thing be in it: This, or ſome ſuch thing as this, the Apoſtle (I ſuppoſe) meaneth by walking in the Spirit; and by putting Chriſtians upon it, to walk in, or by the Spirit he ſuppoſeth ſuch a thing that may be done or attained by them if they will take a courſe thereafter.</p>
               <p>But then it may be objected, If we may engage the Spirit, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> and ſet him on work about any of thoſe ſpiritual employments that have been mentioned, or the like; Muſt not we be looked upon as principal or firſt Movers in every ſuch work, and the Spirit as the ſubordinate Agent only, and ſubſervient unto men, and dependent upon them in his workings?</p>
               <p>To this I reply, no: Firſt, Becauſe when any man doth awaken the Spirit, and engage him to his aſſiſtance, he is firſt awakened by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hereunto, yea, and engaged too; by which the Spirit himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh engaged by himſelf; for we are thus, or after ſome ſuch manner as this, to conceive of the ſpiritual treaty or entercourſe, and of the ſtate of affairs between the Holy Ghoſt and the ſoul of a Chriſtian in whom he dwelleth, in reference to the buſineſs now in hand: Firſt, the Spirit of God was in men before they believed; for otherwiſe they neither could or would ever have believed; yea, and a long time before they believed, otherwiſe there would have been no workings of Conſcience, or movings unto things either morally or ſpiritually good. When men are prevailed with by him to believe, he advanceth his preſence in their ſouls, and now moveth them to things, Actions, and waies of a more worthy and bleſſed conſequence and import, and of a nearer and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Connexion with their ſupreme good and happineſs; as to love God with all their hearts, with all their ſouls, to embrace waies of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, waies of Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs, to mortifie the deeds of the Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By the way, When, I ſay, that the Spirit of God moveth the hearts of men when they believe; I do not ſay, or ſuppoſe withal, that Believers alwaies are prevailed with by theſe movings of the Spirit to do the things, or effectually to conſent to the doing of the things whereunto they are thus moved: For though the Spirit be Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, yet he is a voluntary Agent, and ſo can exert or put forth his Omnipotency in what degree or manner of efficacy himſelf pleaſeth; and we have heretofore (I remember) upon occaſion ſhewed and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:95016:155"/>proved unto you, that the Spirit of God is not pleaſed to work, either compulſively or neceſſitatingly, upon the hearts and wills of men, but only ſo, as to leave them at liberty, at leaſt a poſſibility of going their own way contrary to that whereunto he moveth. To plead that God is Omnipotent, and from hence to conclude, that therefore he ſhould not fail of any, or all things which he intendeth to do, it clearly ſheweth, that men do not underſtand the true nature of God; For though God be Omnipotent, yet God uſeth his Omnipotency according to Rules of Wiſdom and Counſel. Now therefore he putteth forth his Omnipotency, only in putting men into a capacity of doing ſuch things upon which he will reward them; which capacity would be utterly deſtroyed in caſe men ſhould be neceſſitated to do any thing pleaſing unto God. Only this by the way. Now this is one thing why the Spirit of God is not an under Agent, becauſe that men covld never have called for, nor ſought for his aſſiſtance, did not the Spirit firſt move them thereunto: Therefore hence it is evident, that he is the principal Agent, and yet this notwithſtanding he may truly and properly be ſaid to be drawn into our aſſiſtance by us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This is by God himſelf Enacted and eſtabliſhed for a Law between his Spirit and his Saints: That when they having any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Work, ſervices, or Exerciſe to perform, ſhall apply themſelves unto the Spirit, now at hand, and dwelling in them, after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and upon ſuch terms, as we ſhall preſently declare unto you; If they ſhall ſeek for his help and aſſiſtance herein; that then he will aid and aſſiſt accordingly, he will not deny them, but will condeſcend gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly unto them, and aſſiſt them. Now, by the knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this Law, and confidence that there will be no failing on the Spirits part (all which too are preventing wiſe wrought in men by the Spirit) they are encouraged to make their recourſe unto him, and to depend upon him for his aſſiſtance at all times of need: In this caſe the application of the Creature to the Spirit of God, being ſubmiſſive and obediential and not authoritative, there is no reaſon or ground to judge or call the Creature the principal Actor or Mover in what is done by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit; though the Creature may properly enough be ſaid to engage the Spirit to aſſiſt in ſuch and ſuch Actions. As when <hi>David</hi> being to encounter with his Enemies, calling upon God for his help and his preſence with him in the Battle, may properly and truly enough be ſaid hereby (by his Prayer) to engage God to him in his Battel; yet it doth not follow from hence, that <hi>David</hi> was the principal, chief, or firſt Actor in the Battel; Becauſe firſt, It is God that freely maketh that gracious Covenant with <hi>David</hi> (as with other Saints) that if they call upon him in time of trouble (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.15.) or danger, he will hear and deliver.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe that it was God that put it into <hi>David's</hi> heart, and
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:95016:155"/>ſtirred up <hi>David's</hi> ſpirit to go and apply himſelf by Prayer for his help in ſuch a caſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) That which <hi>David</hi> did in this caſe to draw in God to his aſſiſtance, he-did it in ſubordination to the will and good pleaſure of God in that kind, who had encouraged him to call upon him in a day of trouble. There is a like conſideration in Believers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the Spirit of God, and his aid in all our ſpiritual occaſions, works, and employments. For firſt, the Spirit of God hath made a Law, that if we will call upon him (upon the Spirit) in the time of our need, he will be preſent with us and help us.</p>
               <p>But then ſecondly, Becauſe we are engaged hereunto (I mean to call upon him for his aſſiſtance) by his inſtigation hereunto.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) All that you do in this kind it is in ſubjection to his will and pleaſure. Theſe things being conſidered, it is clear that the Creature Man, though he have a power to obtain the Spirit, yet he is not principal Actor, but the Spirit of God is the principal Agent. Thus much for anſwer to the firſt Queſtion.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Queſtion was, How, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> and by what means we may engage or prevail with the Holy Ghoſt to Act with us, and to aſſiſt us in ſuch occaſions of our ſpiritual Concernments as have been mentioned?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, This may and ought to be done by theſe four means:</p>
               <p>Firſt, By diſclaiming (when we go about any thing, any ſpiritual duty or ſervice) our own ſtrength and ſufficiency, as to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it in an holy and acceptable manner, as of our ſelves without the preſence and aſſiſtance of God; I ſay, when men and women ſhall preſent themſelves in all their works and ſervices as weak and impotent, unleſs they be endued with ſtrength from on high; this is one ſpecial ſtrain that doth marvelouſly comport with the Spirit, and that which is in the firſt place to be done by us if we deſire to do any thing; if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire his help and aſſiſtance at any time. Now, to preſent our ſelves alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether weak, without ſome ſuch preſence and aſſiſtance we ſpeak of, this is that which will awaken us to do things by the Spirit: For the way to do things by the Spirit, is not to forbear the doing of things, or duties our ſelves; or not to perform any ſervices: I ſay, it is not to forbear the doing of things until we find the Spirit of Grace, and feel it to work upon us: But to go about that which is our duty to do, in the ſeaſon of it, with a ſerious and humble acknowledgment, and deep ſenſe of our own inability for this work we are about. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Ariſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> to his Son <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>therefore and be doing, and the Lord be with thee:</hi> He doth not ſay, ſtay untill the Lord doth come unto thee, but ariſe and be doing. So that this is the firſt thing to be done, we muſt lay all thoughts of Confidence aſide of any ſufficiency as of our ſelves.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:95016:156"/>
               <p>Secondly, We muſt turn our ſelves towards the Holy Ghoſt with the like ſerious, and thorough, and unfeigned acknowledgment of a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in him: that ſtrength which we diſclaimed in our ſelves we muſt aſcribe unto him. We know that the Lord Chriſt ſtill requireth this acknowledgment from thoſe who obtain any great Requeſt as to any great matters: <hi>Believe ye that I am able to do this?</hi> Saith he to the blind men that came to him to be healed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.28. So again, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>If thou canſt believe, all theſe things are poſſible,</hi> &amp;c. The Father of the Child anſwered, <hi>Lord I believe, help my unbelief.</hi> So then here is another thing whereby to intereſt the Holy Ghoſt in what we go about; namely, that we do acknowledge a ſufficiency in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>But then Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> We muſt acknowledge a readineſs, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a gracious inclinableneſs in the Holy Ghoſt to help and aſſiſt us in thoſe things wherein it is any waies meet for him to interpoſe on our behalf. He who doth unfeignedly acknowledge his own weakneſs, and doth addreſs himſelf unto him ſhall be ſure to find his aſſiſtance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. <hi>Likewiſe the Spirit alſo helpeth our infirmities,</hi> &amp;c. There is a very rich and compaſſionate inclination in the Holy Ghoſt towards the Saints, in reſpect of the great infirmities which he diſcerneth in them, to aſſiſt, ſtand by, and relieve them in their holy endeavours; To help them to perform things in an holy and humble manner upon terms of accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It is a uſual Dialect in Scripture, when the Act is expreſſed by the means or courſe that uſually is taken to effect it: As <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to enlighten every man that cometh into the World,</hi> becauſe he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth them ſuch means, and taketh ſuch a courſe with them which is proper to enlighten them: Even ſo the Spirit helpeth our infirmities; that is, he is ready to help our infirmities, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> as oft as ever he is ſought unto; as if he ſhould ſay, The Spirit knoweth how unable men are for ſuch Actions and Services; and therefore out of a kind of compaſſion and Sympathy, in reſpect of their weakneſs, he is ready to help them. Theſe gracious inclinations in him are apt to advance, and expreſs themſelves in their might and power, when the Creature is under a full knowledge and ſenſe of its own weakneſs, and a full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of this readineſs and willingneſs of the Spirit of God to help and to relieve. <hi>The poor committeth himſelf unto thee: Thou art the helper of the Fatherleſs,</hi> Pſal. 10.14. Meaning, that when the poor do commit themſelves unto God, then he is ready to help them, there is a Synechdoche of the Species for the Genius. By Fatherleſs he doth mean, thoſe that be not in any capacity to help themſelves. Now they that are under a ſenſe that they are not able to help themſelves, by reaſon of their Poverty, God is wont to come in to their relief and ſuccour. So when a man or a woman is ſmitten with the ſenſe of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in being not able to hold out in theſe ſervices; if they ſhall have
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:95016:156"/>recourſe to the Spirit of God, as their helper; this is a Signal given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spirit, and he taketh the Alarm, and he cometh and ſheweth himſelf in his ſtrength unto the Creature. All theſe three means for the intereſſing of the Spirit in our Services I conceive our Saviour himſelf (<hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17.) chiefly pointeth at and aſſerteth. <hi>I will pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he ſhall give you another Comforter; that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth, whom the World cannot receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him,</hi> &amp;c. The World cannot receive the Holy Ghoſt becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him; that is, becauſe they have no manner of ſenſe or diſcerning of him in any ſuch property wherein he deſireth to be known. For we ſhould have given notice of that, though there be a preſence of the Spirit of God in men in the ſtate of Nature or Unregeneracy; yet the Scriptures do nor ſpeak of the Spirits dwelling in men, nor of a mans receiving the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit untill they receive him in a greater meaſure, or after the manner in which Believers receive him, and as he is when he doth advance his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in an excellent degree in them to put them upon Actions of an excellent concernment. But that only by the way. The World cannot receive the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him; that is, becauſe it hath no manner of diſcerning of him, or at leaſt no diſtinct or clear knowledge of him. A man may have the ſight of a Perſon, but that deſerveth not the name of the knowledge of him: But when a man cometh to underſtand of what temper or frame he is; either in reſpect of wiſdom, or goodneſs, or as to matter of Eſtate, or the like, then he is properly ſaid to know a man when he knoweth ſuch things as theſe of him. It is the manner of the Scripture to expreſs Gradations after ſuch a manner as this; ſo He that keepeth <hi>Iſrael</hi> neither ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth; ſo here, the World neither ſeeth him, nor knoweth him; that is, they have not ſeen him, much leſs have they any conſiderate knowledge of him. And when our Saviour giveth the true reaſon why the World did not, or cannot receive him, meaning, that they cannot according to that Principle by which the Spirit of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to give out himſelf, <hi>i. e.</hi> they cannot go beyond God's Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they cannot break the Bars of Gods Decree, nor the Method by which he is purpoſed to diſpoſe of his own Spirit. This deep ignorance which the men of the World have concerning the Holy Ghoſt, is the reaſon why they cannot receive him in any ſupernatural, or in any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving manner; they cannot receive the indwellings, or the inhabitation of him ſo, as to receive ſtrength, to perform ſervices in any ſpiritual or acceptable manner before God; for otherwiſe they are capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Spirit in a way of common illumination: They are capable of receiving of him in another ſenſe, though they are not capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him in ſuch a manner as he is to be received, ſo as to be led by him into the waies of life. By the light of this Diſcourſe we ſee that
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:95016:157"/>they who are not convinced of the neceſſity, both of the preſence of the Spirit of God to help them, and likewiſe of his ſufficiency, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and willingneſs to afford his preſence with them, are under a kind of incapacity to receive the Spirit: But on the other hand, thoſe who have the knowledge of him they are in a capacity of receiving him upon the moſt deſirable terms, and are capable of making uſe of him, as hath been in effect ſaid unto you.</p>
               <p>In the fourth place you muſt pray unto God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> or unto the Spirit of God; for Prayer it ſelf is a means which we are to make uſe of, in order to our being filled with the Spirit. We do here mention it as a part of that Method which ſhould be obſerved by him, who is engaged in the drawing in of the Spirit, in order to a being acted by him. Now then, if this be agreeable to the Will of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that men ſhould pray for the gift of the Spirit, and that in the loweſt meaſure; then there is no queſtion to be made, but that Prayer is as profitable means to effect it in the higheſt in the one as well as the other; and that there is no more unlawfulneſs in the one than in other. This then in the fourth place, by way of direction how you may engage the Spirit, and ſet him on work within you to perform what you are not like to perform by your own ſtrength, without ſuch a preſence of him to aſſiſt in your work.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt Queſtion was, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> In caſe we be able, and ſhall actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally engage the Spirit of God to aſſiſt us, how the things done by him, or by his aſſiſtance, can be attributed unto us, as the Scriptures frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do; or, we be looked upon as the doers of them, as we muſt be if ever we be rewarded for them by God? To this Queſtion we gave an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (in effect) formerly, when we opened this unto you; namely, how, notwithſtanding men do draw in, or engage the Spirit to their aſſiſtance in ſpiritual works and ſervices, yet they are not to be looked upon as principal Agents, and the Spirit as the ſubordinate Agent. Where we explained unto you the Agency or Efficiency of man in ſuch works; in reſpect of which, being truly and really ſuch (as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures every where ſuppoſe them to be) the ſaid Actions and Services may truly and properly be called ours: For whatſoever Action a man doth voluntarily and freely conſent unto may properly enough be ſaid to be his; eſpecially, when the Act of his Will and Conſent contributes any thing towards the Action: Which is clearly the caſe in hand; for whatſoever a man doth by the Spirit, or by his aſſiſtance, is done not only with, or by means of the conſent of his Will, but by the more active deſire and application of the Will unto the Spirit for the doing of it (as we have heard;) yea, that which is yet more, and entituleth a man more clearly unto ſuch Acts as we ſpeak of, is the contriving, and ſtudying, and plotting how they may and ought to be done by the man who doth them. If a man did not conſider how, and by what means,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:95016:157"/>to bring in the Spirit to his aſſiſtance, the great work we ſpeak of would not be done; therefore there is no great difficulty in the queſtion; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that is to be remembred (as we paſs from it) that they who make the Creature either meerly Paſſive, in ſuch Works or Services, or (which little eaſeth the buſineſs) willing (as we ſay) by, or from a neceſſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they deſpoile the Creature of all capacity of being rewarded by God for ſuch ſervices. and thus whilſt they importunely pretend to be the great Magnifiers of the Grace of God, they do indeed and in truth reduce it to a morſel of bread (as the Scriptures ſpeak) and make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it; ſo that in them the Latine Proverb is fulfilled, <hi>Stultorum gratia ingrata:</hi> The grace or favour of inconſiderate perſons is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, or ſuch as there is no reaſon why they ſhould be thanked for it. But this only by the way.</p>
               <p>If you ask, But why ſhould the imploying of the Spirit of God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> in ſuch a manner as you have taught us, be a means for a Believer to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Spirit? Or how ſhould it conduce any thing towards ſuch a bleſſed effect as this is?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That ſuch an imploying of the Spirit, as that we have deſcribed unto you, is a regular uſe of that great Gift of the Spirit given unto us by God; for the Spirit is given of God unto the Saints, for this end and purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that by him, and by his aſſiſtance, they ſhould do all their works which he commandeth them to do. I do not ſay, that it is the ſole end; but that this is one great and material end why the Holy Ghoſt is given unto men, and why he dwelleth in the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. <hi>Now we have received</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God:</hi> That is for this end (amongſt others) and for others depending upon this; that by his help duly ſought and obtained by us, we might be able to know and rightly to conceive, apprehend, and underſtand, and likewiſe firmly to believe the Goſpel, <hi>i. e.</hi> the particular things revealed in the Goſpel concerning Jeſus Chriſt, and the mind and Counſels of God concerning our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: which things are ſaid to be given, or freely given unto us by God, beeauſe they are there exhibited, and lie in a readineſs for all men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and know, that are willing to take the courſe which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed unto them for ſuch an end. There is the ſame conſideration of other ſpiritual Actions and Services as theſe, Mortification, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt is given for this end and purpoſe, that by his aſſiſtance and ſtrength they may be able to perform theſe things after a worthy manner, and with higheſt acceptation unto God. If ſo, then to anſwer the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious intentions of God in giving him (which is by imploying him as we have heard;) This muſt need be a direct and proper means to abound with him, to have an anointing more rich and full of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. For it is a Principle in Reaſon and Equity, that they who make a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:95016:158"/>regular and worthy uſe of a leſs proportion of any good thing intruſted with them, or beſtowed upon them, that theſe ſhould (no other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance hindering) be intruſted with a greater. Upon this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation are theſe, and the like Sayings in Scripture built, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.12. <hi>for whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: But whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away even that he hath.</hi> So again, <hi>Luke</hi> 16 10. <hi>He that is faithful in that which is leaſt, is faithful alſo in much:</hi> Meaning, it is meet that ſuch a perſon who hath approved himſelf faithful in a leſs proportion of any good thing committed unto him, ſhould upon the account of his approved faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs therein be intruſted with more. for God (as hath been obſerved upon the like occaſion) uſually walketh with men, in the Scripture and Goſpel, by ſuch Principles and Rules which are written in the Tables of their hearts by the Finger of Nature, and which they are wont to obſerve and walk by in their common and Civil Affairs. Thus becauſe amongſt men an <hi>Oath is the end of all ſtrife,</hi> Heb. 6.16. Therefore God will ſwear too, and treate with men by the mediation of an <hi>Oath;</hi> and ſo in abundance of other particulars, God ſtill applieth himſelf unto men, and treateth with them by the ſame Rules and Principles which men walk by in tranſactions amongſt themſelves. Now becauſe one man is ignorant of what is in the heart of another, and knoweth not how they will prove, whether diligent or negligent, faithful or unfaithful in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of truſt committed unto them; therefore thoſe whom they have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to truſt, they will firſt try them with a little, that in caſe they ſhould miſcarry and prove unfaithful, the loſs may be the leſs, and eaſier to be born; if they approve themſelves with wiſdom and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in managing that little, then they are encouraged to truſt them yet deeper. And as men are wont ſometimes to try Casks or Veſſels that are new made, and never had Liquor put into them, whether they be tight or leaky; not by putting Wine, or Liquor of value, but water into them: if they will hold water, men have ſo much the better ground to truſt them with Wine alſo. In like manner, though God (as is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.25.) <hi>needed not that any man ſhould teſtifie of man: Becauſe he knew what was in man;</hi> and conſequently, what would come out from him, and what he would do: So (I ſay) though God knoweth before hand how men will prove, whether faithful or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful in any thing committed unto them, and in this reſpect needeth make no experiment and trial of them, in reference to any truſt; yet becauſe it is the manner, and according to the Principles of wiſdom in men to take ſuch a courſe; he alſo will do it, though he hath other ends and reaſons likewiſe for the doing of it, which it is not neceſſary now to ſpeak of. Thus alſo it is in matters of reward (more properly and commonly ſo called;) though he knoweth from the beginning the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs integrity of mens hearts, and what ſuch men in time will
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:95016:158"/>do all the good work, all that righteouſneſs, and ſuffer all thoſe things for righteouſneſs ſake, which afterwards they do and ſuffer; yet until they have given an account, both unto himſelf, Angels, and men, of that their integrity, by waies of righteouſneſs and well-doing, he will do no great things for them; he will reward men only according to their works, according to what they ſhall do or ſuffer, nor according to what they purpoſed to do or ſuffer; unleſs happily they be prevented of an opportunity; for that by the way, leaſt there ſhould be miſtake, not as if God ſhould have no conſideration or regard of any mans faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful intentions; that is not the meaning of it; as many times you may find perſons whoſe hearts are full of fruitfulneſs; that notwithſtanding are taken away by death. Now it is not imaginable that God ſhould deprive them of the reward of ſuch ſervices, when as God himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth men the opportunity to do them, it is not reaſonable, nor like unto the waies of God, or his proceedings, that he ſhould deprive them of their reward, in ſuch a caſe, or under ſuch circumſtances: But the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the good things which men have done, whether they be few or more, theſe ſhall be rewarded accordingly: So that men and women who have given teſtimony unto the World of their own integrity, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs, and faithfulneſs unto God, God will give them rewards anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hereunto.</p>
               <p>We ſpeak this for this end, to ſhew that God's manner is, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, nor to take knowledge of the righteouſneſs of men, until the World have taken knowledge of it, until that they have given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count unto men that they are perſons fearing God: I ſay, God will not take any knowledge of them, until they having given ſome Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony unto the World of the integrity and uprightneſs of their hearts; a Teſtimony of the truth of their Faith, and of the ſoundneſs of their Love, that the World cannot deny but that certainly theſe are very worthy men; then (as in Scripture Phraſe) God is not aſhamed of them, but they are in an immediate capacity for him to own, and to reward, and do great things for. As it is ſaid of <hi>Enoch,</hi> he was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. of whom it was reported that he walked with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.22. Now God could ſuffer no diſparagement, in point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by owning of him. And ſo 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. <hi>That the trial of your faith being much more precious than of Gold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>might be found unto Praiſe, and Honour, and Glory:</hi> It is not ſaid, that your Faith being more precious than Gold; but that the trial of your Faith, this is that which will turn to an account of Praiſe, and Honour, and Glory unto men in the great day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the trial of your Faith might be a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony in abundance given unto men, yea, unto God himſelf; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when their Faith ſhall have been tried; whether it be by their conſtant ſufferings for righteouſneſs take, or whether it hath been by a holy and blameleſs Converſation, it is not much material; if this trial of it be the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:95016:159"/>making of it known, and bringing it to light in the World, that ſo it may be known and obſerved by men: In ſuch a caſe it is a thing but equal, and juſt, and well becoming God to be found rewarding of them with great and wonderful things.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> Another means whereby we may come to be filled with the Spirit of God, is to ſow unto the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>He that ſoweth to the Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption: But he that ſoweth unto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſhall of the Spirit reap Everlaſting Life.</hi> If the Queſtion be, What is it to ſow to the Spirit?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, according to the uſual import of that Metaphorical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſowing, to ſow to the Spirit is to do ſuch things which will redound to the praiſe of the Spirit of God; to manage Actions ſo, that the benefit of them may accrue to another. This the Apoſtle calleth a ſowing to others, <hi>If we have ſown unto you in ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnal things?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11. To ſow unto the Spirit, is to imploy a mans ſelf about ſuch things, ſuch waies and works, whereby the Spirit may receive honour and praiſe, which is all the harveſt which the Spirit of God, and ſo God himſelf, is capable of receiving from men. Only we may add this, That when men do ſuch things which are for the honour and praiſe of the Spirit, they muſt do them with an intent that they may turn to his praiſe; we muſt not do ſuch things only which may accidentally turn to the praiſe of the Spirit: But we muſt do them with a deſire and purpoſe of heart that they may be to his praiſe. So that to ſow to the Spirit denoteth fruitfulneſs in good works, eſpecially in ſuch good works wherein more particularly the glorious goodneſs and power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Spirit may be diſcovered unto the World; and when men are addicted unto ſuch waies, and ſuch works which have a proper and clear tendency to diſcover the goodneſs, bounty, power, and excellency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Spirit of God; then they may be ſaid to ſow unto the Spirit; eſpecially, when they do theſe things with an intention to commend his goodneſs and power unto the World. So to ſow to the Fleſh is to do that which tendeth to pleaſe the ſenſual part of man; and this with an intent to gratifie the Fleſh: whether we underſtand it in reſpect of the outward Actions of the body, or the corrupt workings of the mind, it is clear that men in either of them do ſow to the Fleſh. Only this is to be minded, that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care of the outward man, and the doing of ſuch things which in a regular way tend to the maintenance and comfortable ſubſiſtence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, are never ſaid to be a ſowing to the Fleſh, in oppoſition to the Spirit, but only when men are inordinate in the uſe of theſe things, then, and only then doth the Intereſt of the Fleſh come in. For whilſt men and women are providing for the comfortable being of the outward man, they all this while walk by the Rule of the Word of God, and comport with the Spirit of God. Theſe kind of doings are not properly the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:95016:159"/>works of the Fleſh, but may be more truly ſaid to be the works of the Spirit; For the Spirit of God requireth that all things ſhould be done in a regular manner, that the outward man may not be diſadvantaged unto ſpiritual Services, therefore the Spirit of God doth charge men with particular care and circumſpection over their Bodies, that by this means he may rejoyce with ſo much the greater Joy where he findeth men manage themſelves ſo that they may be in a good capacity to do ſuch things which are holy, juſt, and good, and that are righteous, and of a good report. Now the reaſon why ſuch things as theſe muſt needs be matter of praiſe unto the Spirit of God is, becauſe the hearts of men cannot lightly, when they ſee men full of good works, but acknowledge that theſe things do come from the Spirit of God; becauſe ſuch works as theſe, being in goodneſs and glory above the Line of men, plainly aſſert their Original to be Divine; and plainly inform the World that God by his Spirit vouchſafeth to dwell and to act in men and women, from whom ſuch excellent works as theſe proceed. But more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſuch waies and works which outſtrip the generality of men (yea, of Chriſtians) and which they are not at preſent able to underſtand, nor to ſee the reaſon of them; ſuch were ſome of the actions and waies of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.13. <hi>For whether we be beſides our ſelves it is for God, or whether we be ſober it is for your cauſe. For the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemed in ſome of his Actions as a man half-witted or beſides himſelf, and as a man bereaved of his ſenſes; yet this doubtleſs was of the beſt and choiceſt ſeed, the beſt kind of ſowing unto the Spirit of God; it is true, that at the firſt performance of them the World did not underſtand (no nor Chriſtians neither, of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary anointing, as was even now hinted) nor could-reſolve them into their proper Principles; so as to ſay, that this was the Spirit of God that moved and ſtirred him up. As the Seed for a while lieth buried in the ground, and afterwards ſpringeth up: Even ſo when the reaſons of ſuch actions ſhould be manifeſt unto them, then they ſhould confeſs, that he had a great and mighty aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God with him. There are ſome things which are above the ordinary reach of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and moral men, though the truth is, there hath been here and there a Son of Nature (<hi>Philoſophers,</hi> and ſuch like men) that have gone very far, and as high (it is likely) as many of the Sons and Daughters of God have done, or do; as, in that great work and ſtrain of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in forgetting and forgiving of injuries, and paſſing by all matters of unkindneſs, diſparagement, and contempt which they have met withal from the hands of men. Now, for men and women to take no knowledge of ſuch things from any, nor to draw back from them, or to withhold the hand of their goodneſs, bounty, or good will in any kind from them, upon the account of any ſuch hard meaſure received, this is one of the higheſt, and one of the moſt ſpiritual ſtrains that can
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:95016:160"/>be, that the nature of man is likely to partake of. To be able to do good in the preſence of all theſe diſcouragements, doth argue, even to the generality of men, that ſuch a man is of an excellent ſpirit, and that he hath a great preſence of the Spirit of God with him. And doubtleſs, though there may be excellent things written in this kind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe that have not been ſeaſoned with the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt (at leaſt in ſo explicite a manner;) yet is there a more peculiar and a more rich preſence of the Spirit vouchſafed unto thoſe who enjoy the Goſpel, and which moveth them more ſtrongly to ſpiritual actions, and which have a more immediate and ſtrong connexion with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent joy and comfort, and alſo with their Eternal life and good of their ſouls. But beſides this, there are other things of an excellent import, <hi>Let your moderation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.5.) <hi>be known unto all men:</hi> The word ſignifieth, let your yieldingneſs, or comportance, and compliance be known unto all men: he meaneth, ſweetneſs and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs of diſpoſition; a readineſs in men ever and anon to give away their own right, to deny themſelves in many things, which, according to ſtrict terms, and the rigour of the Law, they might ſtand upon. When ever there is danger that upon their account the Goſpel is like to ſuffer in the hearts and conſciences of men, in caſe they ſhould ſtand ſtifly upon their own rights, then the opportunity is before a man, then hath he a call to practice that moderation, and that yieldingneſs, and gentleneſs of Spirit which the Apoſtle calleth for at the hands of Chriſtians. We might inſtance in many more particulars of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but you ſee by that little which we have inſiſted upon what we mean by ſowing to the Spirit.</p>
               <p>But if you ask, How ſhould ſuch a thing as this be any way or means to help us forwards in this, <hi>viz. A being filled with the Spirit,</hi> or any waies promote ſuch an end?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, This is clear from the Principle inſiſted upon in the former Point, That to him that hath ſhall be given: He that is willing to ſow to the Spirit, it is a ſign that he (in the ſenſe of this Scripture) is a man that hath received the Grace of God. Now they that declare that they have, <hi>i. e.</hi> that take a courſe to make the World acknowledge that they have; they that have in this ſenſe, ſhall have more abundantly; and yet ſtill the more they have, the more they ſhall have; and the faſter and the thicker that men ſhall ſow to the Spirit, they ſhall ſtill have more ſeed. As God giveth natural Seed unto the Sower, ſo doth he give ſpiritual Seed unto him that ſoweth unto the Spirit; he ſhall have more ſtrength, and vigour, and ſtronger Propenſions to do well and worthily, yea, to abound in well doing. This is a third means to be made uſe of in order to a being filled with the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another means for the ſame end, I mean, of being filled with the Sprit, is to feed and cheriſh, to nouriſh and ſtrengthen the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:95016:160"/>motions of the Spirit: when at any time he beginneth to burn or riſe up in a little flame in the ſoul; then <hi>(toties quoties)</hi> to be ready to caſt ſpiritual oyl upon the flame, that ſo he may advance the motions which he hath begun, is another excellent and pregnant way and means to be filled with the Spirit. To open this means or direction unto you, it is to be ſuppoſed, that the Spirit where he inhabiteth and dwelleth will ever and anon be heaving and putting forth in the hearts and ſouls of men; he will be ſecretly inciting, and gently moving and perſwading men and women unto good waies and actions, unto waies of Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, and Goodneſs, and the like, ſometimes in one kind, and ſometimes in another; yea, many times (it is likely) he will be moving men, and perſwading them to actions, not ſimply and poſitively good, but unto ſuch waies and actions that are higher and more excellent, and more worthy than any of thoſe wherein they yet walk, or have been accuſtomed, or have lift up their hearts or hands unto. This then is that we adviſe you, in this means or direction, that whenſoever you perceive or feel the Spirit riſing or moving within you unto any thing that is good, worthy, or meet to be done, as (if you live inwardly, and have much and cloſe communion and converſe with your hearts and ſouls) you may frequently find that he is: When (I ſay) at any time you are ſenſible of any good motion conceived and raiſed in you, that then, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, you provide ſpiritual milk and honey to feed, ſtrengthen, and nouriſh the tenderneſs of it; for when theſe motions come from the Spirit they are at firſt but weak, and tender, and faint; but you may take a courſe, by nouriſhing of them, that of ſoft and tender motions you may make them ſtrong, if you take unto you ſuch and ſuch conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which are apt and proper both to continue on foot and keep alive the ſaid motions within you, and likewiſe to fortifie and encourage them. Gentle and ſoft motions, bearing upon your hearts and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, are but like a ſoft Air or breathing of wind upon a Ships ſails, which help her not much on her way: So the breathings of the Spirit, the firſt riſe of them are but ſoft and gentle, but there is a proper kind of nouriſhment to be adminiſtred unto them which will enlarge and ſtrengthen them. Let the motions be what they will (as indeed there may be a thouſand motions of this kind) the Scripture doth afford wherewithal to nouriſh them all. As the Earth bringeth forth all kind of of Herbs, Trees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the Scriptures yield a proper and peculiar kind of Nouriſhment, a peculiar kind of conſideration of truth, which will fortifie and ſtrengthen all thoſe motions, and raiſe them up in growth and ſtature. As ſuppoſe it be a motion unto a more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, frequent, and conſciencious attendance upon the Ordinances of God's Houſe, and the Affairs there; the Scriptures will fill you with motives and conſiderations which are apt and proper to nouriſh, fortifie, and ſtrengthen you in this ſervice. So again, ſuppoſe that the motion
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:95016:161"/>be to works of Charity, to a more open handedneſs unto works of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; the Scripture will furniſh you with nouriſhment for ſuch motions alſo. Or if the motions of the Spirit be to abandon or caſt off idle and unprofitable company, who are good for nothing but to waſte our precious time; I ſay, the Scriptures will nouriſh theſe motions alſo: You ſhall find meditations there, and ſuch words and conſiderations that are proper nouriſhment for all ſuch motions of the Spirit as theſe mentioned, with their fellows, which will cauſe them to wax, and grow, and gather ſtrength until it be too hard for the contrary corruptions and infirmities to hinder them. My Brethren, there be many choice moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Spirit of God which may die, and never bring forth. As there are many Children that die in their Infancy, and never grow up unto men: Even ſo the truth is, that where there is one Motion that doth grow and come to any maturity, it is to be feared that there are many thouſands which for want of nouriſhment (and becauſe they are not propagated and encreaſed by adding further ſtrength unto them) die, and come to nothing. As it is with the Seed of Mankind in their Infancy and tender years, we know that they are capable of living and growing up unto men, yet are they not capable of propagating in their kind till they are grown up to ſome maturity: Even ſo, motions to good, take them in their beginning, though they are capable of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto their full ſtrength, yet they are not preſently capable of action untill they be trained and fed up, until they come to maturity: Then they will beget in their own likeneſs, then they will produce in their kind. Thus we ſee, if we deſire to be filled with the Spirit of God, we muſt do as we uſe to do with our new-born Infants, make much of them, and not deſpiſe them becauſe they are weak: No, but we are to be very tender of them, and to nouriſh them, and to cheriſh them, to miniſter ſuch food unto them that will ſtrengthen them unto, or at leaſt until they are grown to Maturity. A motion which at firſt hath little or no ſtrength, and ſo cannot go abroad into any Action or Service, by that time you have nouriſhed and carefully tendered it in your hearts and ſouls, though it was but like a grain of Muſtardſeed at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yet being nouriſhed and fed in your hearts, after a while it will be full of ſtrength and vigour; and whereas at firſt it might eaſily have been quenched, after it cometh to maturity it will be able to nouriſh it ſelf. Now the reaſon of this direction, in order to a <hi>being filled with the Spirit,</hi> runneth upon the former Principle which we lately men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>viz. To him that hath ſhall be given.</hi> Man who ſhall nouriſh and cheriſh the motions of the Spirit of God when they are in him (as it were) in ſwadling cloaths, and little, and ſhall be a good Foſter-Father unto them, ſhall certainly have a greater and greater preſence of this Spirit, untill it ſhall enable him to do great and glorious things; and ſo ſhall delight in him daily more and more, and ſtir and raiſe up
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:95016:161"/>other and more excellent motions which never came into his mind, or heart before.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> Another means whereby the Temple of your ſouls may be filled with the glory of the Spirit of God is to be <hi>led by the Spirit, Rom.</hi> 8.14. You know there are ſome Horſes will not be led, but a man muſt pull and haule them after him; but there are other Horſes that are obedient and tractable in your hand: So where there is a tractableneſs and teachableneſs in men, that the Spirit of God leadeth them, as it were, by the hand this way and that way, when men are eaſie to be taught by him, this is another ready and pregnant means whereby to be filled with the Spirit. My Brethren, you may be ſaid to be led by the Spirit when you go along with him, or are willing to go that way wherein he would lead you by every good motion. The Spirit doth take (as it were) every man and woman by the hand, and doth upon the matter deſire them to be willing to be lead: Now when men and women are willing to accept of the Spirit of God for their Leader and Guider in ſuch waies and courſes as he doth like to lead them unto, theſe are they that are led by the Spirit of God. It is no great difficulty, no great Maſter-piece to know when, and in what caſes we are led by the Spirit of God, and when not; for if we know but ſo much, as to be able to diſtinguiſh between good and evil; if we can but diſtinguiſh ſuch motions that be good from thoſe that be evil, we may know by this alone when we are led by the Spirit of God, and when not: For moſt certain it is, that all motions to good, which are either mediate or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, are from the Spirit of God; therefore, if it be a good motion, it is eaſie to know what Parent it hath, namely, God. So now, if by any motions, which are at any time ſtirring or working within us, we find our hearts drawn out unto ſuch and ſuch a good way and work; in this caſe, if we ſhall ſeek for, or conſult with the dark part of our ſouls to find out Arguments to diſparage them, as if they were not the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, or of the Spirit of God, but were from ſome other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, there may be much danger in it: But if men ſhall not ſeek to draw back upon any ſuch pretenſes as theſe (only becauſe they would not go along with the motion, it being contrary to ſome unruly luſt, or unworthy deſign which they are carrying on in the World) but ſhall be willing to be led by the Spirit: If they need not to be pulled and hauled, but ſhall come on freely and readily, and ſhall be willing to go along with the motions of the Spirit, without asking any queſtion for conſcience ſake, or rather for luſts ſake; this is another great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that will turn to an happy account in order to a compleating this great deſign of your <hi>being filled with the Spirit of God.</hi> For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that giveth a more demonſtrative proof that a man is a true born Son of God than that he is willing to be led by the Spirit, in the ſenſe declared. It was a ſaying amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> He is an ill Souldier
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:95016:162"/>that followeth his Captain groaning and ſighing: Even ſo, he is not a reconciled perſon with his own peace and comfort who ſtudies and caſteth about, and would fain be excuſed from the ſervice of God. By the way, that we may not diſcourage any to comply at any time with the motions of the Spirit, when any perſon, man or woman, ſhall make a long work of finding out pretenſes before they will go along with theſe motions; nevertheleſs if they do comply and go along with them at laſt, though it be late, yet better ſo than wholly to reject and caſt them off; but this is not the way of wiſdom, there is a far better and more excellent way than this, in order to the great bleſſedneſs (we ſpeak of) of being filled with the Spirit, which is, to be freely willing to go along with the Spirit of God in his leading and guidance. And ſo we have briefly done with this means alſo; Only the reaſon or ground of this direction we ſhall illuſtrate a little further, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that hath ſhall have more abundantly; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> They that comport with the Holy Ghoſt in his motions, who are willing to go along with him in works of Holineſs and goodneſs; they do by him as a man doth by his friend whom he ſymbolizeth with in Diſpoſition, Genius, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; his waies, are his waies; his delight, his delight; his ſorrows, his ſorrows; this ſtrengthens Friendſhip between man and man: Juſt ſo, when a man ſhall ſymbolize, and fall in at every turn with the Spirit of God, and ſhall be like unto him in his waies, and ſhall follow him in his motions, and ſhall own them; ſuch a deportment, as this is, will cauſe the Spirit of God to delight in a man, and to rejoyce in him: For if the Spirit of God be capable of being grieved, as it appears he is by what the Apoſtle ſaith concerning him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God,</hi> &amp;c. Then certainly he may be pleaſed and delighted; he may be ſo uſed and entreated by men, ſo that he will take pleaſure and delight in them. We have opened this Metaphor unto you hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, therefore we ſhall only touch it by the way. Grief, when it is applied unto the Spirit of God, doth not ſuppoſe or imply any ſuch thing as if the Holy Ghoſt may be grieved in a true or proper ſenſe: No, but the meaning is this, that ſuch a courſe may be taken by men that the Spirit of God may be provoked to do as men uſe to do under grief. As for inſtance, when men are under the Paſſion of grief they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed unto action, they are liſtleſs unto any expreſſion of themſelves in one kind or other; grief and ſorrow ſtraitens and contracts the hearts of men, that they become half dead, having no life, no luſt, no ſpirit to any thing out of themſelves: So likewiſe, the Spirit may be ſaid to be grieved when he keepeth ſilence in men, and doth not act as he was wont to do. When there is a deadneſs in the Soul, when there are no luſtings therein unto that which is good, it is a ſign that the Spirit is grieved; becauſe he ſtirreth not, he moveth not, he cometh not forth as he was wont to do, but leaveth the ſoul ſolitary and to it ſelf: And
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:95016:162"/>when there is ſuch a calm, no breathing of the Spirit upon the ſoul, there will be no luſt, no motion, nor deſire to do any thing that is ſpiritual or heavenly; and then it is with the ſoul as it is with a quantity of Wine, when the Spirits are extracted out of it, that which remaineth is but as a little water: Juſt ſo are the Spirits, and hearts and ſouls of men when the Spirit of God is grieved within them, when he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth; Their very life, and all that vigour of ſpirit which at other times is found in them, all is under hatches and doth not appear: On the contrary, when the Spirit of God is pleaſed and delighted in men, he is like unto men when they are under greateſt contentment and ſatisfaction of mind, they are now in a poſture and readineſs to do all the good they can, to pleaſe and gratifie every man. This we have opened unto you formerly, and have ſhewed you how the Scriptures run much upon it; As ſaith <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> to <hi>David, Let him take all foraſmuch as my Lord the King is come again in peace,</hi> 2 Sam. 19.30. And ſo <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Where is then the bleſſedneſs you ſpeak of? For I bear you record, that if it had been poſſible you would have plucked out your own eyes,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo again, <hi>Bleſs, and curſe not;</hi> bleſs I ſay, for thereunto you are called; as who ſhould ſay, Chriſtians by means of that rich portion of contentment and joy which they are intereſſed in by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are in a poſture to do good unto the World, under all the curſings and proſecutings of it: Even ſo it is with the Spirit of God when he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth delight and pleaſure in a man, then is he enlarged towards him, he is then active, ſtirring, and vigorous in the heart and ſoul. Theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, quicknings, and encitements unto waies that are good, theſe beat ſtrong upon a man. Now the Spirit of God, the more he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the more he doth enlarge and give out himſelf unto men. So then, if we deſire to be <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> here is another means proper to obtain it, namely, if you will be led by the Spirit. There is nothing more pleaſing unto a man, eſpecially unto a man of wiſdom, than to ſee his Counſel followed: This very impreſſion being found in the hearts of men, argueth, that there is a like ſtrain of this in the nature of God; for we have often ſignified unto you, that God made man after his own Image, endued him with the ſame Principles of Wiſdom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (namely, for nature or kind) which were in himſelf; he drew a kind of Copy of his own Wiſdom in the Nature of man. And this by the way is the reaſon of another thing alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> That in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with men about the great and important buſineſs of their everlaſting Peace, he ſtill goeth by ſuch Rules which men go by, and manage the things of their higheſt concernments. But now the reaſon why God doth deal with men in very many caſes by their own Principles, is not ſimply becauſe he will thus fall in with them, but becauſe theſe are the Rules of God himſelf, according to the excellency of his Nature, by which he ruleth and governeth the World.</p>

               <p>Sixthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> It muſt needs be of good conſequence unto you, in order to your being filled with the Spirit, to take and keep all things out of the way which are contrary hereunto; I mean, which are like to hinder, and will hinder your being filled with the Spirit, in caſe they be not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and kept out of the way, to ſee that we do not lay any obſtruction in his way, but that it may be plain and ſmooth before him. Now thoſe things in the general, which are like to be an offenſe unto the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, and ſo obſtructive to your being filled with him, are all ſuch things which are gratifactory and pleaſing unto the fleſh, and tend to the encouragement and ſtrengthening of the hand thereof. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe the Apoſtle informeth us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. that the Spirit and the Fleſh are contrary one to the other, and luſt one againſt the other; one luſteth after that, or after the doing of that, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth and perſwadeth men and women to the doing of that, which being done, is contrary to the intereſt of the other; it diſcourageth, weakens, and diſableth the force or moving power of the other in the ſoul. Therefore a courſe is to be taken, and ſomething done that may reſtrain the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Fleſh, or at leaſt break the heart or ſtrength of it. It is not like the Spirit will advance to the filling of the ſoul with his preſence ſo long as luſt remains in heart and ſtrength in men; for this is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred and taken along by way of caution at this turn, that though there be a contrariety in all the luſts of the Fleſh unto the Spirit, yet all kinds or degrees of theſe luſtings are not ſo, or upon ſuch terms repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and contrary to the Spirit and his growth in men, but that this may proceed and go forward ſome of them notwithſtanding. For as it is in the comings in of the Tide and flowings of the waters, whilſt the Waters are encreaſing, and the banks filling, there are ſome ſmaller refluxes or fallings back of the water, which are preſently recovered, and this with advantage by the next reflux and bearing up of the Tide, ſo that the Tide holdeth on its way, maketh good its courſe untill it cometh to its height and fulneſs, theſe leſſer refluxes notwithſtanding: In like manner, though there be at times ſome leſſer yieldings and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings back of the Spirit in the ſoul, meeting with the current or ſtream of the Fleſh, yet he may be brought on again, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> and that with power, to the over-bearing and breaking the motions and current of the Fleſh, and ſo keep ſtill upon the advance, and be filling of his channels and banks daily.</p>
               <p>There are two kinds or degrees of the luſtings of the Fleſh, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> though they be both contrary to the Spirit and his motions, and advance in the ſoul; yet one of them doth little or nothing to interrupt him in his courſe, the other is that which grieveth him, and obſtructeth him in his way. The former kind of theſe luſtings are ſuch, which, for diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſake, we may call natural, though the word be not altogether ſo proper to expreſs the thing intended; the Greek hath ſomewhat a more
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:95016:163"/>ſignificant term, wherein to expreſs them, calling them <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſudden ruſhing or inconſiderate riſings or ſtartings up of nature, or the natural faculties in the ſoul, which-they compare to the winking or ſhutting of the eye-lids when any thing threatneth the eye; or ſo to the lifting up of the hands to the head for ſafeguard, when a blow is coming upon the head; theſe are Natures motions by inſtinct, and they do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the conſent of the will, or diſcourſe of reaſon. The latter kind of theſe luſtings are ſuch which have gained or gotten the conſent of the will unto them, and hereby they conceive (as <hi>James</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15.) <hi>i. e.</hi> are made pregnant, like a woman that is with Child; ſo have ſuch luſtings as theſe, the Act or Deed it ſelf of ſin in their womb or bowels, <hi>Then when luſt hath conceived it bringeth forth ſin, and ſin when it is finiſhed</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi> actually or externally perpetrated or commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted] <hi>bringeth forth death. Then when luſt hath conceived,</hi> &amp;c. This clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſeth that there is, or may be, a luſt or luſting, which (in this reſpect) is Virgin like, hath no corruption of the act of ſin in it; wherein the act of ſin is not formed or ſhaped. This kind of luſt, we ſpeak of, is <gap reason="foreign">

This kind of luſt may be troubleſome unto a man, and find him inward exerciſe and work, more than enough, to ſuppreſs it as it riſeth, that ſo the will and conſent may not touch it, or come at it; yet this is not the luſting of the Fleſh which doth much obſtruct the Spirit in his way, or prejudice the ſouls being filled with him. <hi>Paul</hi> was a man that was abundantly filled with the Spirit; and yet he ſaith, that he <hi>knew that in him</hi> (that is in his Fleſh, as he interprets) <hi>dwelleth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. <hi>And that he ſaw</hi> ver. 23.

I have ſtood ſomewhat the longer upon the opening of this paſſage of the Apoſtle, becauſe I deſire, with as much evidence and ſatisfaction as may be, to make out this unto you, that ſo you need not be diſcouraged in the courſe or way of your endeavours to be filled with the Spirit, by ſuch kind of luſtings of the fleſh within
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:95016:164"/>you as theſe we have ſpoken ſo much of, though they ſhould ſtill haunt and follow you, in as much as you have heard that he that was filled (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the brim) with the Spirit was notwithſtanding obnoxious to ſuch a luſting. Such Luſts as theſe do not intoxicate, bewitch, or drink up your Reaſon, Judgments, or Underſtandings; but they may remain whole and intire unto you (them notwithſtanding) for any ſpiritual work or ſervice, and conſequently for comporting with the Spirit of God, in order to his filling you with himſelf. But</p>

                  <hi>it bringeth forth ſin,</hi> &amp;c. as plainly ſhew, that Luſt alſo may be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated and dealt with, as to be made pregnant and big with the external Act it ſelf of ſin.

By the way, when <hi>James</hi> ſaith (as we have heard) <hi>Then, when Luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin;</hi> The meaning is not, as if this alwaies proved ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that every Luſt conſented unto produceth the external or complete Act of ſinning; there are many times Conceptions where there are no Births or bringing forth of Children; many things may interpoſe to occaſion an abortion, or a conſumption of that which is conceived in the womb: And thus it may be, and often is in the caſe of Luſts in their conceptions; many men have for a time intended and purpoſed to do many things that are evil, whoſe purpoſes and intentions notwithſtanding have been diſſolved or turned out of their way; ſo that they never come to be put in execution. This is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, when by <hi>Abigail's</hi> wiſe behaviour and advice he was taken off from his hard and bloudy intentions againſt <hi>Nabal</hi> and his Houſe. Therefore the Apoſtles meaning, in ſaying, that <hi>when luſt hath conceived it bringeth forth ſin,</hi> is not to ſhew what is alwaies done in the caſe he ſpeaks of, but what is frequently done, and alwaies like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or probable to be done, of which kind of ſayings there are very many in the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.9, 10. <hi>If any man walk in the day</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>he ſtumbleth not: but if a man walk in the night he ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth;</hi> his meaning is, neither to affirm that no man that walketh in the day ever ſtumbleth, nor that every man that walketh in the night doth ſtumble, but only, that there is a probability both of the one, and of the other, and that they are likely either to ſtumble, or not to ſtumble: So likewiſe (the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.32, 33. <hi>The unmarried careth for the things of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. But this only by the way. The buſineſs we have in hand is to give you to underſtand and know, that that kind of luſting, which hindreth your being filled with the Spirit, yea, and will hinder it, untill it be taken away, is that which is owned, accepted,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:95016:165"/>and approved of by the will and judgement of a man or woman, and for the gratifying and fulfilling whereof care is taken by men. Such luſts as theſe are they which grieve and quench the Spirit, and conſequently hinder his progreſs, motion, or advance in the ſoul. When (with the Scriptures) we ſay the Spirit is grieved, we do not mean, nor doth the Holy Ghoſt in this expreſſion mean any thing elſe, but only that he is turned out of the way; he doth retire himſelf, and is quiet and ſtill, men ſhall hear but very little from him, ſo that there will be but very weak and faint motions and ſuggeſtions from him.</p>
               <p>But we were ſaying unto you that all fleſhly luſts in the general are obſtructive to the courſe of the Spirit, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> in his advance or growth in the ſoul. Now as all Luſts in the general entertained and countenanced (as hath been declared) in the heart and ſoul, are malignant againſt, and oppoſite unto the growth and coming on of the Spirit in the Soul; ſo the Scriptures ſeem to caſt an eye upon ſome as being of a more virulent and expreſs antipathy in this kind than others, and obſtruct that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of the ſoul we ſpeak of, with an higher hand than their fellows: Theſe are ſuch luſts which carry in them a direct contrariety to thoſe ſignal characters, or properties which the Scriptures take notice of, and aſcribe unto the Holy Ghoſt. We ſhall take notice of (at preſent) and briefly inſiſt upon only four of theſe, and the like number of luſts in men more directly oppoſite unto them. Firſt, The Spirit of God is famouſly known, throughout the Scriptures, by the great attribute of holineſs; he is more frequently termed the holy Spirit, than ſpoken of under any other name, or expreſſed by any other Character whatſoever. We ſhall not need to cite places for this: The thing (I preſume) is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known unto you all.</p>
               <p>A ſecond property, which the Scriptures attribute unto the Spirit of God, is, Grace, or a gracious diſpoſition, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. He is termed, <hi>The Spirit of grace.</hi> And God is termed, <hi>The God of all grace,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10.</p>
               <p>A third property taken notice of in the Holy Ghoſt by the Scriptures is his heavenlineſs; he is ſaid in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. to have been <hi>ſent down from heaven,</hi> which implies that his coming, or ſending into the World, is about the affairs of heaven, and that he only mindeth theſe; ſo elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he is ſaid to be <hi>the Spirit which is of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12, 14. So alſo in <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26. Chriſt promiſeth to ſend him from the Father, all which imply him to be an heavenly, and heavenly minded Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
               <p>A fourth property, and the laſt we ſhall now take notice of, which the Scriptures mind in the Holy Ghoſt, is, a diſpoſition and propenſneſs of mind in him to be communicating and revealing the Counſels and ſecret things of God unto the minds and conſciences of men. This property of the Spirit of God (which is of ſome aſſinity with the laſt
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:95016:165"/>named, and gives teſtimony unto it) is oft mentioned in the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12, 13. <hi>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit ſearcheth all things: yea, the deep things of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man ſave the Spirit of man which is in him?</hi> &amp;c. So again, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>Now we have not received the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> by his diſcovering it unto our Judgments and Conſciences) <hi>the things that are freely given to us of God; which things alſo we ſpeak, not in the words which mans wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth.</hi> And ſo in <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Howbeit, when the Spirit of truth is come</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Comforter) <hi>he will guide you into all truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he will ſhew you things to come,</hi> &amp;c. This is another heavenly property of him who cometh from the Father to communicate and acquaint men with the great myſteries of the Counſels of God, ſo far as it doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the ſouls of men to know them. Now all ſuch luſts and ſinful diſpoſitions (being indulged and nouriſhed) which are contrary to, and fight againſt theſe properties and diſpoſitions of the Spirit, are (and muſt in reaſon needs be) moſt diſtaſteful unto him, and conſequently moſt obſtructive to him in his way of advancing his bleſſed preſence in the ſouls of men.</p>
               <p>The firſt of the four Particulars attributed unto the Holy Ghoſt in Scripture was holineſs; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> he is ten times over (and I believe twenty times to that) called the Holy Spirit, and ſometimes (in our Engliſh Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations) the Holy Ghoſt. Now holineſs, as we know (or at leaſt have often heard) imports ſeparation, or diſtance from every thing that is unclean. And where holineſs is in its exaltation, it importeth the greateſt diſtance from uncleanneſs that is poſſible. But without diſpute holineſs in the Spirit of God is in the height of its exaltation: It dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in him bodily; Therefore there muſt needs be the greateſt diſtance between the Spirit of God and all manner of uncleanneſs. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do ſhew that this is the nature of holineſs, not ſimply to fly from that which polluteth and defileth, but to be at the utmoſt diſtance from i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Upon this account it is in Scripture often oppoſed unto uncleanneſs, as the Eaſt is oppoſite unto the Weſt, as being at the greateſt diſtance from it. <hi>For God hath not called us unto uncleanneſs, but unto holineſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.7. And ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. And very frequently in the Scriptures you ſhall find a great oppoſition made between holineſs and that uncleanneſs, whoſe fulfilling polluteth and defileth the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of mens bodies; as the luſt of Adultery, Fornication, Inceſt, and all impurities of ſuch a kind, which being conſented unto, and harbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the ſouls of men and women, are obſtructive with an high hand to that great felicity and happineſs of their being filled with the Spirit. The Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 30. plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates ſuch an Antipathy between ſuch luſts of uncleanneſs as theſe,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:95016:166"/>with their fruits: and the Spirit of God, that they are a grief unto him, and conſequenly (as we lately opened the Metaphor unto you:) that his hand is weakned by them to that good work of filling men with his preſence; which otherwiſe was in his heart to have been wrought for them; <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed cut of your mouths, but that which is good to the uſe of edifying, and grieve not the holy Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Let no corrupt communication, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, putrified or <hi>rotten ſpeech;</hi> ſuch as is wont to proceed from theſe impure Fountains we ſpeak of in the hearts of men and women. For even as thoſe ſents and ſmells which are wont to breath from Laiſtoffs and Dunghils are noyſome and offenſive unto men who have their ſenſes quick and good: So are unclean Communication and rotten ſpeech unto men who have their ſpiritual ſenſes about them. Now laſcivious, wanton, unchaſte, or unclean communication is therefore termed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, corrupt or rotten; becauſe unto them that have their ſenſes (their ſpiritual ſenſes) ſound and in a good temper and habit, exerciſed in diſtinguiſhing things that differ; ſuch Communication and Diſcourſe is ſuch a kind of annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or offenſe which anſwers that annoyance to the bodily ſenſes, which is occaſioned (as was ſaid) by the fumes and ſmells of Laiſtoffs, Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, and putrified bodies, which are not ſimply unpleaſant and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, but of dangerous conſequence alſo to diſſolve, ſtifle, or deſtroy nature; for otherwiſe there may be ſents that are offenſive and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and yet not Enemies unto nature, nor yet of any tendency to her diſſolution, but for her preſervation and health: In like manner, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton communication and diſcourſes are not only or ſimply noyſome or unpleaſant unto men and women, that have their ſpiritual ſenſes about them, but have a dangerous influence alſo to deſtroy their ſpiritual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that work of grace which is begun in their ſouls; according to that of the Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.33. <hi>Evil words corrupt good manners;</hi> not that they do alwaies do it, but they have a property ſo to do; they are of a deſtroying nature, and if theſe deſtroy good manners, then have they a property to do this alſo, <hi>viz.</hi> to deſtroy all thoſe good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples out of which good manners are produced. And whereas to this Exhortation, that no corrupt or rotten communication ſhould proceed out of their mouths; he immediately ſubjoyneth, <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of Redemption;</hi> he doth it by way of motive, clearly implying, that ſuch <hi>communication</hi> will <hi>grieve</hi> the Spirit of God. Now this connective Particle, <hi>and,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times implieth a motive enforcing the precedent Exhortation, <hi>Do this and live,</hi> Gen. 42.18. <hi>i. e.</hi> for you ſhall live by doing this. <hi>Exalt her, and ſhe ſhall promote thee,</hi> Prov. 4.8. <hi>i. e.</hi> for ſhe ſhall promote thee: I give thee this for thy encouragement, that ſhe ſhall promote thee. So that the meaning of the place in hand is, that ſuch a kind of rotten communication will grieve the Spirit of God: That is, hath a direct
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:95016:166"/>tendency in it to cauſe the Spirit of God to do as men uſually do when they are grieved (as we formerly ſhewed) withdraw themſelves from thoſe who ſo grieve them, and grow liſtleſs unto action, and have no luſt to go forth in their way; but retire themſelves, and mourn, and grow ſolitary. In like manner, rotten Communication will cauſe the Spirit to withdraw his preſence in his wonted influences, he will have no deſire to exert, or put forth himſelf (at leaſt with any ſtrength or vigour) in motions or encitements to holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by means whereof the Fleſh will gather more and more ſtrength, and the luſts thereof en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe daily. This ſheweth that there is a ſpiritual oppoſition between rotten Communication, or any other luſts of the Fleſh and the Spirit of God. So <hi>Jude,</hi> ver. 19. <hi>Theſe be they who ſeparate themſelves, ſenſual, having not the Spirit;</hi> Implying, that they who are given over to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and voluptuous courſes are perſons who have no the Spirit. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this diſtinguiſhing Character that they ſeparate themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Bodies and Societies of the Saints, and from the Ordinances of God. The Apoſtle would ſignifie this unto us, that ſuch perſons as theſe did it under pretenſe of a greater meaſure of the Spirit; ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial diſcovery of ſomewhat more than had been made known unto other men: As if they were of too tall a ſtature and growth to aſſemble themſelves with others; as men think not themſelves fit company for Children; ſo theſe men, upon pretenſe of a more excellent inſpiration from the Spirit of God, ſeparated themſelves from other men. But (ſaith he) there is this in the bottom, they are ſenſual: this ſeparation doth not proceed from the Spirit of God, nor from any further Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion more than others which they have with him: But they are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual, ſenſual pleaſures and courſes have bewitched and taken away their heart: And now, that they may enjoy themſelves in this courſe, they muſt pretend to Revelation, and ſome extraordinary Knowledge (for the Saints in their Communion know no ſuch thing, but that which they know is of another nature) and therefore that they might not be troubled and checked in their way, they muſt give ear to an unclean Spirit; and this they call the Spirit of God, and that in oppoſition unto others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, A ſecond Property of the Spirit mentioned was his grace. We read <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. of <hi>deſpighting the Spirit of grace.</hi> And ſo God is called 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>The God of all grace;</hi> meaning, that he is a gracious Spirit. Now grace (as we have formerly opened the nature of it unto you) importeth a readineſs, or great propenſeneſs in the will and ſoul of a man, to ſhew kindneſs, or to do good where no engagement is from without from him unto whom kindneſs is ſhewn, it differeth from mercy. For the object of mercy alwaies is miſery, or perſons in miſery: But the object of grace may as well be perſons in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and free from miſery, as thoſe that are in miſery; for Grace
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:95016:167"/>only reſpects, as it were, an abſence of all motives or engagements, from thoſe to whom we intend good, and reacheth no further. So then, when the Spirit is called the Spirit of grace, it doth import a freeneſs, a readineſs, a willingneſs, and propenſeneſs of mind to do good unto ſuch perſons who never laid any engagement upon him, to whom he is no waies Debtor by one Law or other. When there is a propenſeneſs in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus freely without engagement to deal courteouſly or kindly with others, this is Grace truly ſo called. Now the Spirit is ſaid to be a gracious Spirit, becauſe he vouchſafeth to come unto men, and to dwell with them, and to couple and joyn himſelf with men, whileſt they are ſtrangers unto him, even whileſt as yet he hath received to no kindneſs from them, he is pleaſed to come unto them, and to invite them. Nay, the truth is, there is a more excellent degree of grace than this in the Spirits dealing with men; when kindneſs is ſhewed not only where no engagement hath gone before, but contrary to engagements on the other hand. This is grace in abundance, and in its exaltation, when a perſon hath done us wrong, or diſgraced us unjuſtly, and offered us injury, and we, notwithſtanding ſuch hard meaſure received from him, ſhall yet be ready to ſtand by him, and accommodate him, then are we gracious in an excellent and eminent degree. Now, ſuch luſts and ſinful diſpoſitions in men, which are contrary to this Character or property of Grace in the Spirit are very diſtaſteful unto him, apt to grieve and obſtruct him in his courſe as well as the former, <hi>viz.</hi> uncleanneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In that former place, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. where the Apoſtle had added, <hi>And greive not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are ſealed unto the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption</hi> (meaning, by corrupt communication:) He immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking be put away from you, with all malice,</hi> &amp;c. The motive lieth in the middle between the two Exhortations, and it enforceth them both; it is a motive both to that which went before, <hi>Let no corrupt Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceed out of your mouth;</hi> and unto that which followeth, namely, that all wrath, and malice, and the like ſhould be put away. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this clearly ſhews, that theſe kind of corruptions, and diſtempers, bitterneſs, and malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are contrary to the Spirit of Grace, and thoſe gracious diſpoſitions and inclinations of his to do good, and to ſhew kindneſs and love where there is no merit; yea, even unto thoſe men who have rather merited ſorrow and hard meaſure from him. But much more when men, without any provocations, ſhall be in bitterneſs of Spirit, and full of wrath and anger, and ſhall entertain and admit malice evil thoughts, and intentions of hardneſs, cruelty, and bloud into their hearts, this being ſo extremely contrary to that gracious and ſweet property of the Spirit of God, in reaſon muſt needs be ſignally obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive unto him in his way of filling men with himſelf.</p>
               <p>A third Property was the heavenlineſs of the Spirit of God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> 
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.31.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:95016:167"/>
                  <hi>He that is of the earth, is earthly, and ſpeaketh of the earth; He that cometh from heaven, is above all:</hi> Therefore that Luſt that is contrary to this property in the Spirit of God (heavenlineſs, or heavenly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) this muſt in a way of reaſon be offenſive unto the Spirit of God. Of this kind are all luſts of Covetonſneſs, inordinate Love unto this preſent World, earthly mindedneſs, when mens hearts ſavour the things of the earth only, or mainly; when the matters of this life eat out the very heart and ſinews of a Man. Such Luſting as theſe muſt needs like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be of a very offenſive nature unto the Spirit of God. When the Holy Ghoſt ſhall come unto men, and offer them life, and ſhall be ready to lead them into the Faith, Knowledge, and Love of God; when he ſhall talk and diſcourſe with men and women about heavenly things, and they anſwer him with their carnal and their ſenſual things; when he diſcourſeth unto them of Faith and Holineſs, and the things of their Eternal Peace and bleſſedneſs, and they ſhall have cars only to hear of Silver, and Gold, and Wealth, and Grandeur, and Power, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the like; certainly, if luſts of this nature be made much of, and harboured in the ſoul of a man, there can be no expectation that ever the Spirit of God ſhould take pleaſure or delight to put forth, or to give out himſelf in his glory in ſuch a ſoul.</p>
               <p>A fourth and laſt particular was a diſpoſition, aptneſs, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> or readineſs of mind to communicate the things of God, matters of a ſpiritual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, the Secrets of God unto the minds and conſciences of men: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch kind of Luſts in men which are oppoſite to this property in the Spirit of God muſt needs be offenſive unto him, and obſtruct him in this bleſſed work we are ſpeaking of. Which luſts and diſtempers are theſe, and ſuch like, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch luſts by which men are invited, tempted, and carried away from the Miniſtry of the Spirit, and thoſe waies whereby the Spirit is wont to utter himſelf, which are the Ordinances of God, and eſpecially that of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and more eſpecially, ſuch a kind of Miniſtry which is prepared, as it were by God on purpoſe, to bring forth the mind of God unto men. For as God of old appointed <hi>Moſes</hi> and the People to meet at the door of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle: So now hath he appointed the World, the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, to meet with him in theſe Miniſtrations of his Houſe, and to treat with him there about the great buſineſs and things of their peace. If men and women therefore ſhall ſuffer the great Enemy of their peace ſo to bewitch them, that they fall in their eſteem of theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments of his; and look upon them as if there were no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in them; this is another thing which hath a direct oppoſition unto, and is a ready way to quench the Spirit of God. Mind and compare theſe two verſes together, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi> But how, or which way ſhould they prevent it? <hi>Ver.</hi> 20. he informeth them, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not Propheſying.</hi> As fire, by laying on, and throwing combuſtible
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:95016:168"/>matter upon it, may be made greater and greater, and the flame to wax and grow more and more: So the Spirit of God is like a fire in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men; he may be nouriſhed after ſuch a manner that he will flame out, as fire doth when more wood is laid on it; but as fire will go out if you withdraw the Fuel, or throw Water upon it: So (ſaith the Apoſtle) you will quench the Spirit, if you ſhall deſpiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying; for that is the fuel or nouriſhment by which the Spirit of God is fed, theriſhed, and maintained in the ſoul, and conſcience, and heart of a man; if you will withdraw this fuel, and deſpiſe Propheſie, neglect the Ordinances of God, and Miniſtrations of his Houſe, he will ſoon be gone and leave his place: He cannot live in the ſoul with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this kind of nouriſhment and food adminiſtred unto him from day to day, and time to time. And thus you ſee as all kind of fleſhly Luſts in general fight againſt the ſoul, and are obſtructive unto the peace thereof, being as ſo many bars in the way of the Spirit; ſo there are ſome Luſts which do more appropriately, and in a more particular manner oppoſe his progreſs. So that if you deſire to be Poſſeſſours of ſuch an invaluable Treaſure, as a being filled with the Spirit of God, you muſt not make a light matter of it, ſo as to ſuffer ſuch words and directions as tend thereunto to come in at one ear and go out at the other; No, but you muſt make Treaſure of them, and be very ſerious in a buſineſs of this nature. And if you will proſper in this deſign, you muſt be ſure to remove out of the way, as theſe four kinds eſpecially, ſo alſo all other Luſts of the fleſh, which elſe will hinder you in ſo bleſſed an enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But it may be you will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> How ſhall we keep our ſelves from the luſts of the fleſh, in order to our being filled with the Spirit?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, and ſay; You may do it; yea, the doing of it may, without any preſumption, be attributed unto you, as done by you (eſpecially in their firſt riſe, and before they are grown to any great ſtrength, or maturity within you) without any ſpecial preſence of the Spirit of God (I mean, a full and rich preſence of him.) For there is a kind of ſtanding preſence of the Spirit of God with every man, which we call his preventing Grace, which every man hath (if he hath not conſumed it, and made a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſpoyl of it) which will keep men from theſe kinds of Luſts, in caſe men ſhall but comply with it. For (my Brethren) theſe kind of Luſts have no power in them to compel or to neceſſitate any man or woman unto ſubjection to them; No, they do but only offer or preſent themſelves to ſee if you will entertain, or own them, and nouriſh and bring them up. If you will take pleaſure in them, and go with them whither they will lead you, you may: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they have no inſſuence of power and authority over you, neither have they any Commiſſion from God; and Sathan can give them none, any way to compel you to open the door of your hearts unto them, to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:95016:168"/>give them room and entertainment there. No, but if you ſhall be true and faithful unto your own ſouls and their itnereſt, and be in love with that bleſſedneſs of being filled with the Spirit, you may keep your ſelves free from vanity, and fleſhly luſts. For to abſtain from them, is but to let them alone, to let them go as they come; do but you keep on your courſe, and follow the light which is ſet up within you; do but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain and keep from an inward converſe and communion with them, and they ſhall never do you any harm, nor ever prejudice you, in the carrying on your work, and in the proſpering of your ſouls, as to your being filled with the Spirit. There is only one means or directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh and laſt means which I ſhall preſcribe unto you, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> or rather remind you of, being preſcribed by God himſelf for your being filled with the Spirit, is Prayer unto God for it. If you deſire that your anointing ſhould be rich and full, you muſt imploy your Angel, which God hath given to ſerve you in this, and all other your ſpiritual occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, about it: I mean, the Spirit of Prayer which you have received from God. Many great and excellent things (you well know) are ſpoken of Prayer in the Scriptures; that it is a Key to open Heaven as oft as we deſire; a Meſſenger that, if his diſpatch be thereafter, will fetch us any thing out of the Treaſury of God that we ſtand in need of. You know alſo that heap of Promiſes and Encouragements which the Lord Chriſt himſelf hath heaped upon the head of Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7, 8. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 11.9, 10. <hi>And I ſay unto you, ask and it ſhall be given you; ſeek and you ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh, receiveth; he that ſeeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened.</hi> Firſt, theſe words (<hi>And I ſay unto you,</hi> &amp;c.) ſeem to imply, that what he was now about to ſay unto them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the marvelous efficacy and acceptation of Prayer with God, if another one ſhould have ſaid it, it might reaſonably ſeem doubtful or queſtionable in point of truth unto you: But I would have you to take knowledge, that it is I that ſay it, you may believe it upon the account of my authority, though it be, indeed, a great and ſtrange ſaying, and hath a world of grace in it: yet ſaith he, this is enough ſufficiently to balance this, I ſay it. Now, by <hi>asking, ſeeking, knocking,</hi> our Saviour (queſtionleſs) meaneth all kinds, or variety of Prayer; intending to declare and ſignifie ſome ſuch thing as this unto us, that if men be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and upright hearted in their praying unto God, whether the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or form of their Prayer be of this kind, or of that; whether it be <hi>asking, ſocking,</hi> or <hi>knocking,</hi> it ſhall be of like acceptance with God, and ſhall obtain what is deſired. If any man will pleaſe to adventure upon any narrow diſtinguiſhing, of asking, ſeeking, and knocking, he may do it after ſome ſuch manner as this is; though I would not have too much to be given to the Notion. Asking very probably may be ſuch a
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:95016:169"/>kind of Prayer which is right down, where there is little or no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or little or no Scripture Rhetorick, but only a right down, and direct, and immediate asking, ſignifying unto God what it is that a man would have without any more ado. And ſecondly, Seeking ſeemeth to be a more exact or enlarged kind of Prayer, wherein a man goeth about to fortifie his heart to believe that he ſhall receive the things that he prayeth for,, by conſidering ſuch and ſuch Arguments and Grounds in Scripture; ſo that it noteth a kind of diligence, and ſuch an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a man which taketh up much of his time. And thirdly, to knock, that may ſeem to ſignifie a kind of Prayer with importunity. As ſome men are right down, and cannot uſe many words, nor form and faſhion a Prayer with that dexterity and commendableneſs, which others can; ſo there are ſome that are importunate, and with a kind of leſs curioſity than others are. Now the Promiſe is not made joyntly unto them thus; If you ask, and if you ſeek, and if you knock, you ſhall receive, find, and it ſhall be opened unto you. No: But there is the ſame Promiſe in effect and ſubſtance made unto every one of them apart, Seek and you ſhall find, Ask and you ſhall receive, and knock and it ſhall be opened unto you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, to ſecure and eſtabliſh them to whom he ſpake (who were his Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.12. that they, howſoever, ſhould obtain their deſire of God in Prayer, in what form or manner ſoever they ſhould pray, he delivereth this general Rule or gracious Declaration in the name of God, <hi>That every one that asketh, receiveth;</hi> and he, <hi>i. e. every one that ſeeketh, findeth; and to every one that knocketh, it ſhall be opened unto him; for every one that asketh,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, you that are my Diſciples, and believe in me, you may be confident that what good thing ſoever you ſhall ask of God in Prayer, it ſhall be done; for, or becauſe <hi>every one that asketh, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> &amp;c. Meaning, that Gods will and gracious good pleaſure is, not only that you, and ſuch as you are, ſhould have whatſoever you ask of him, alwaies ſuppoſed that you ask things meet for him to give, and things that are good and meet for your ſelves to receive, as it is explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11. But whoſoever ſhould ask any thing of him upon ſuch terms, ſhall receive it from him likewiſe, therefore you much more. To make the truth and certainty of the performance of this Promiſe more eaſie of belief unto them he uſeth this Argument, <hi>A minori ad majus</hi> (as the Logicians term it) an Argument which proceedeth and riſeth from a leſs probability unto that which is greater, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.11, 12. <hi>If a Son ask Bread of any of you that is a Father, will he give him a Stone? Or if he ask a Fiſh, will he give him a Serpent? Or if he ſhall ask an Egg, will he offer him a Scorpion? If ye then being evil</hi> [a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration hard hearted, and indiſpoſed unto Acts of bounty] <hi>know how to give good gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> That which <hi>Matthew</hi>
                  <pb n="311" facs="tcp:95016:169"/>expreſſeth in the general <hi>by good things or good gifts, Luke</hi> (as we ſee) expreſſeth in particular, <hi>viz. the gift of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> clearly imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that of all other gifts which God hath in his power, and in his will too to give unto men; he is moſt free, ready, and willing to give his holy Spirit upon their making known by Prayer their deſire unto him on this behalf. Now then, it is a Rule or Principle in Reaſon, which heretofore (I remember) upon like occaſion I have ſometimes menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned unto you; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſe habet ſimpliciter ad ſimpliciter, ita magis ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis.</hi> If a thing may ſimply, or to a lower and leſſer degree, be obtained by the uſe of ſuch or ſuch means ſimply, or in an ordinary degree, then by doubling or trebling the means, the thing or end deſired (being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being obtained either more fully or more ſparingly) may be obtained more amply or fully. As if fire ſimply, or in a leſſer quantity, will warm a man, then a greater fire will warm him yet more. And as the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> told the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when with his Bow and Arrows he had ſmote the ground only thrice, and there ſtaid, a <hi>Kings</hi> 13.18. <hi>Thou ſhouldſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have ſmitten five or ſix times, then hadſt thou ſmitten Syria until thou hadſt conſumed it; whereas now thou ſhalt ſmite Syria but thrice.</hi> In like manner, if Prayer ſimply, or praying once, twice, or thrice, or praying with ſuch or ſuch a degree of giving out of the heart and ſoul in Prayer, will obtain the gift of the Spirit of God ſimply, or to ſuch a degree, then certainly praying yet more, more frequently, and more fervently muſt needs obtain this gift in an higher and richer degree, and conſequently by advancing ſtill, and riſing higher and higher in Prayer, we may obtain to a <hi>being filled with the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be here demanded, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>22</label> But if God be ſo willing and free (as you have ſaid) to give his holy Spirit unto men; Why doth he impoſe the condition of Prayer upon them in order hereunto? Why doth he not give it unto them without Prayer? Or how ſhall they to whom it is not, or hath not been given pray for it? Can men pray for the Spirit of God without this Spirit, ſo as to obtain the gift of him from God? To theſe things I reply, Firſt, God may be exceeding willing and free to give his holy Spirit unto men, and yet not be willing to give him in any other way, and upon any other terms, than of mens applying themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by prayer, for the obtaining this gift of him; yea, his declaring of himſelf in this point unto men (I mean, that upon their prayer he will give his Spirit unto them) is a clear Argument that he is ready and willing to give him; For will any man teach another how, or by what means he may come by ſuch or ſuch a thing, which he hath no mind or deſire that he ſhould have or come by? Surely no man will do it. The reaſon then why God requireth prayer at the hands of men, in order to the obtaining of the gift of the Spirit from him, is not to make the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the gift more difficult, or becauſe he is in any degree loath or
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:95016:170"/>unwilling to give him: but becauſe the tranſcendent excellency or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs of his wiſdom requires ſuch a thing as this of him; Judging it meet to enact ſuch a Law whereby he ſhould ſubject his Creature Man to the condition of Prayer for the obtaining of ſuch a donation or gift as this is from him, and that he ſhould not give it unto him in any other way. And this meetneſs we our ſelves are capable in part to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and apprehend: For upon a like ground or account it is that we nurture our Children (at leaſt many diſcreet Parents do) ſubmiſſively to ask of us ſuch things as are neceſſary and meet for them before we give them unto them. As our Saviour himſelf alſo ſeemeth to intimate in thoſe paſſages lately mentioned: <hi>If a Son asketh bread of any of you that is a Father, will he give him a ſtone? Or if he ask a fiſh,</hi> &amp;c. By theſe Expreſſions it ſeems it was the manner amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviours daies, to ask their Parents ſuch things as they deſired, or ſtood in need of, before they gave them unto them. And as God ſhews no unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (as hath been ſaid) to give his holy Spirit unto men; but rather a readineſs and propenſeneſs in him in this kind (to give him) by enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men to pray for him: So neither doth his requiring righteouſneſs and holineſs in men to render them capable of happineſs and bleſſedneſs from him any waies prove, or intimate in the leaſt, any unwillingneſs in him to make them bleſſed, but the contrary rather; I mean, a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in him to make them bleſſed, according to that of the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 81.13, 14, 15. <hi>Oh that my people would have hearkened unto me, and Iſrael had walked in my waies; I ſhould ſoon have ſubdued their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> &amp;c. We ſee evidently in this place, that God had an ardent, and even a longing deſire in him to make <hi>Iſrael</hi> an happy and bleſſed people; and that in order to the obtaining of his deſire herein he had preſcribed unto them Laws and waies of righteouſneſs for them to obſerve and walk in. For that is to be conſidered, and taken knowledge of, that the great and ardent deſire of God, here expreſſed, was not ſo much that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould have hearkened unto his voice, that they ſhould be a holy people: But he would have them a holy, righteous, and worthy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in order to their being a happy people; it is ſtill the end, not the means that is principally deſired. Now the end, which God princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally deſired and projected in his giving righteous Laws and Statutes unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> to obſerve and do, was not their obedience unto theſe Laws, but the making of them a happy people, by means of this their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in ſuch a way which might not be repugnant to his infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. This <hi>Moſes</hi> had clearly informed them of long before (ſaith he, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.15, 16.) <hi>I have ſet before thee life and death, good and evil,</hi> &amp;c. You ſhall find that God doth expreſly profeſs unto them (<hi>Deut.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.25, 28. <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.18, 19.) that all that he doth require of them in rendering ſuch obedience unto him was for their own comfort, and for the comfort of their Poſterity, that they might live and poſſeſs that
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:95016:170"/>good Land, and that they might enjoy it. And as Gods requiring of men Faith, Love, and Obedience unto his Commands to put them into a capacity of Salvation; and as his threatning them with the loſs of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unleſs theſe things ſhould be found in them, do not argue any the leaſt degree of unwillingneſs in God that men ſhould not be ſaved; but the contrary, even the great deſire of his ſoul that way: In like manner Gods requiring men to pray unto him for his holy Spirit, to make them capable of receiving him, doth not at all prove, or ſo much as intimate the leaſt unwillingneſs in him to give him unto men, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the longing deſire of his ſoul to give him. This for Reply to the firſt thing in the difficulty propounded. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas it was demanded, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>23</label> How can ſuch perſons pray for the Spirit that are not in the ſtate of Grace (I mean) pray ſo as to be accepted with God in their Prayer, and to obtain what they pray for in this kind without the Spirit firſt had and obtained? To this alſo I reply.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By Conceſſion, that no man (doubtleſs) can pray for the Spirit, ſo as to obtain what he prayeth for, but he that hath the Spirit; [<hi>viz.</hi> in ſome degree and meaſure or other,] for it is the Spirit of God in men, that enlightneth them to ſee and diſcern things that are juſt, and good, and meet for them to do, and ſo likewiſe which admoniſheth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth them to do them. Now therefore if any perſons do pray unto God for his Spirit, ſuch perſons are quickned, moved, and ſtirred up hereunto by the Spirit of God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I anſwer by way of Exception two things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Spirit is in ſome meaſure or degree graciouſly vouchſafed unto every man coming into the World, in as much as every man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned (at leaſt to ſome degree) to ſee and diſcern the things menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; and ſo likewiſe is ſecretly minded, and put upon it to do things that are apprehended juſt, and good, and meet to be done; for that which mens Conſciences do, or are ſaid to do in this kind, they do by the help and motion of the Spirit of God within them. Therefore from hence it followeth:</p>
               <p>Secondly, That whoſoever ſhall pray for the Spirit, doth not pray for it ſimply, without the Spirit, though (poſſibly) he may pray for it without any ſuch preſence or aſſiſtance of the Spirit, which is found in true Believers (I mean) in thoſe who believe to Juſtification.</p>
               <p>If it be here replied and ſaid, <hi>That without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> therefore no preſence of the Spirit without Faith can enable men to pray any Prayer unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>od with acceptation, and conſequently not any Prayer upon which the Holy Ghoſt can be attained. I Reply.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That as the Apoſtle affirms it, to be in the caſe of contributing to good works; <hi>That if there be firſt a willing mind it is accepted</hi> [or
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:95016:171"/>rather he, or the man is accepted] <hi>according to that which he hath, and not according to that which he hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.12. Meaning, that if he be willing in his way, and doth that which he is well able to do, God doth accept him, and doth not reject him, or diſapprove him, becauſe he doth not more than he is able to do: So it is in any other kind of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours or engagements of a man whatſoever; for there is the ſame reaſon of others which there is of this. If a man doth that, or be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do that which he is able to do (I mean, well able, humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities conſidered) this is accepted with God, though it comes not up to the perfection, or degree of worth, which is found in the ſame kind of action performed by other men. Therefore he that prayeth unto God, ſuppoſe it be for the Holy Ghoſt, according to the ability of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which God hath given him, he is accepted with him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Concerning that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> I Reply, If we underſtand him to ſpeak of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith, then we muſt underſtand him likewiſe to ſpeak of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God unto Salvation; and thus the meaning of the ſaying will be only this: It is impoſſible without a true Faith, ſuch a Faith which worketh by love, for any man to pleaſe God, ſo as to be ſaved by him: But otherwiſe that God may be pleaſed in a ſenſe, or to an inferiour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree without that Faith which is juſtifying and ſaving, is evident from many places in Scripture. <hi>Ahab</hi> pleaſed God to a degree, and to the obtaining of the removal of a ſore Judgment both from himſelf and his Houſe, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.29. Yet evident it is by the tenour of the place, that he was far from being a perſon truly believing, or a perſon juſtified in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>In like manner, <hi>John</hi> was not a man endued with Juſtifying Faith, as appears by the Character which the Holy Ghoſt gives of him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.29, 30. yet was God well pleaſed with him, not only to do as great matters for him (as he did for <hi>Ahab</hi>) <hi>viz.</hi> To eſtabliſh the Kingdom to him, But likewiſe to continue this Kingdom unto his Poſterity for four Generations; howbeit from the ſins of <hi>Jeroboam Jehu</hi> did not depart. This is Character enough to ſhew that he was not a true Believe; and yet the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done well,</hi> &amp;c. Men may do well, though they may be without juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faith. It is no way probable that all of the Family of the <hi>Rechabites</hi> were Perſons ſo juſtified in the ſight of God, and in favour with him, yet was God well pleaſed with them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35.14, 18.19. So the men of <hi>Niniveh</hi> were not all and every one of them in the favour and love of God, they were not in the ſtate of Juſtification. The like may be ſaid of the young man in the Goſpel, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21, 22. It appeareth from that ſad parting between the Lord Chriſt and him, when he went away ſorrowful from him (you know upon what words ſpeaking) that he was not in the ſtate of Juſtification in the ſight of God; yet nevertheleſs
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:95016:171"/>he did many things well, and was in very great favour with Chriſt as man, for it is ſaid, that <hi>Jeſus beholding him loved him.</hi> So then, men that pray unto God for the gift of his Spirit may be accepted with God, as to the obtaining of what they pray for, though they be not in an eſtate of Juſtification.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly, If we underſtand the Saying of the Apoſtle men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> of ſuch a Faith which only importeth a knowledge of the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of what we do, or intend to do, in which ſenſe the word is ſometimes uſed in the Scriptures: And particularly thus it is twice uſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>He eateth not of Faith;</hi> here the word Faith is taken for knowledge of the lawfulneſs of what a man doth. I ſay, if we underſtand ſuch a kind of Faith as this, then it imports no more but this; that without a belief or knowledge of the lawfulneſs of what a man doth, he cannot pleaſe God in the doing of it. Now, that men may know the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of praying unto God for his Spirit without Juſtifying Faith, and conſequently, pleaſe God in the Action, ſo far as to obtain what is prayed for, needeth (I ſuppoſe) be no mans queſtion, at leaſt if we grant or ſuppoſe, that a man may believe, or know, and that without Juſtifying Faith, that God hath a Spirit to give unto them that ask him. Now, though it be ſomewhat hard to conceive, how a man without Juſtifying Faith (yea, and ſomewhat more) ſhould diſtinctly know or believe, that God hath a Spirit to give coeſſential, or of the ſame infinite being with himſelf; yea, poſſibly many that have Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith may be ignorant or doubtful of this (as we read of ſome in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. that they did not know, as they profeſſed, whether there were any Holy Ghoſt or no) yet that God is able inwardly to enlighten, quicken, ſtir up, and ſtrengthen to that which is good, men may know and believe without ſuch a Faith which juſtifieth: and to know this (I mean, that God is able to enlighten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is interpretatively, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructively to know that he hath a Spirit to give, becauſe theſe things are proper for him to do by his Spirit; and (doubtleſs) God, out of his abundant Grace and Condeſcention unto his Creature Man, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue his Prayer as a Prayer made unto him for his Spirit, who ſhall pray for illumination and quickning unto waies and works of well doing. This for the ſeventh and laſt means we ſhall inſiſt upon (at preſent) by which men and women may be filled with the Spirit of God, <hi>viz.</hi> Prayer. And thus much likewiſe for reſolution of the Second Queſtion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <hi>viz.</hi> How men and women may come to be filled with the Spirit, and what is to be done by them in order hereunto?</p>

               <p>THe Third (and laſt) Queſtion was this, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> How a man may know or judge, whether either himſelf or others are filled with the Spirit of God, or with ſome other Spirit that pretendeth to be the Spirit of God, but (indeed) is a Spirit far differing from it? For reply hereunto theſe five things are neceſſary (in a few words) to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the way:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there are a Generation of men and women in the World who cannot properly be ſaid to be filled with any Spirit at all, in one kind or other, unleſs (haply) it be with that which the Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth (in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8.) a ſpirit of ſlumber, or rather a ſpirit of ſloath; ſuch as the Wiſeman deſcribeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>How long wilt thou ſleep O ſluggard? When wilt thou ariſe out of thy ſleep? Yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little folding of the arms together.</hi> Some there are, that are of a dull, heavy, and of a ſtupified temper, little active or ſtirring in one kind or other; ſomewhat like unto the men of <hi>Laiſh, Judges</hi> 18.7. who are ſaid to have been <hi>quiet and ſecure, and to have had no buſineſs with any man.</hi> We know there are ſome ſuch in the World, who ſeem to have little ſenſe, either of the one World, or of the other; yea, ſcarce to know whether they be alive, or in being or no. Now, though theſe kind of perſons, we ſpeak of, be as good as dead unto all manner of activeneſs; yet if this be come upon them by any Judgment of God, by reaſon of any preceding ſin or provocation, they may truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly enough be ſaid to be filled with the Spirit of ſlumber, drowſineſs, or floth; becauſe God hath left them in the hand, and to the power of ſome evil ſpirit or other, who diſmantles and bereavs their nature, bodies, and ſouls of that activeneſs, or diſpoſition unto Action, in one kind or other, which is natural unto them, and otherwiſe would be found in them. But if that ſuch a kind of temper be found in any perſon ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, by way of Nature, and not by a juſt recompenſe of reward, for ſome
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:95016:172"/>former ſinful miſcarriages, then the caſe is far differing; I cannot ſay that this is a ſpirit of ſlumber or ſloth that is upon them: But if it be upon ſome other account; if it come upon them in a way of Judgment from God, for ſome ſinful abuſe of mercies, then they may be ſaid to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a ſpirit of ſlumber: and this heavy temper, that renders them thus unactive every way, and in all reſpects, ſeems to be the effect of ſome evil ſpirit, unto which God hath given Commiſſion or Permiſſion thus to puniſh or abaſe the Creature for his ſin. For it is very probable (to add this only by the way) that as in Commonwealths, or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Politique, the Inhabitants, for the accommodation and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the whole, betake themſelves to ſeveral Callings, Occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Trades; ſome are Husbandmen, ſome Carpenters, ſome Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the body of a Commonwealth (as it was the ſaying of a Philoſopher) doth not conſiſt of a Husbandman, and a Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but of variety of Trades; wherein reſpectively by means of an Appropriation or Confinement of themſelves, to one and the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, they become more expert and dexterous, every man in his way, and ſo the whole is the better accommodated and provided for. In like manner (I ſay) it is very probable, that theſe wicked and unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Devils (who have a Politie, ſuch as it is, to manage and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold) for the accommodation of their affairs, and the advantage of their Kingdom, and the greatneſs thereof, that they do betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſeveral Trades and Occupations in their way; and that ſome of them apply themſelves to one kind of Action or imployment, for the better managing and maintaining of their Kingdom, and ſome unto another. All the variety of imployments which are practiced amongſt them, or is (indeed) any waies neceſſary for the welfare (ſuch as it is capable of) of their Kingdom, being reduceable to theſe two general Heads:</p>
               <p>Firſt, The tempting men unto ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The troubling and tormenting them, when he hath overcome them by temptation.</p>
               <p>Now, under theſe two Heads may be reduced all that they have to do. And in both theſe there is a kind of Appropriation or Aſſignment of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and things ſutable unto particular Spirits. We know there are ſeveral kinds and great varieties of ſins which the Sons and Daughters of men may act, and perpetrate, and are ſubject to be tempted unto. And ſo again, there are great varieties of Puniſhments and Judgments which are inflicted by God upon Men. Now as there are great varieties of ſins whereunto men and women may be tempted, as ſins of Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Adultery, Covetouſneſs, Idolatry, and the like: So is it very probable (from the Scriptures) that there are ſeveral Devils that do at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon all theſe ſins; there is one kind of Devil that attends upon this kind of ſin, another upon that; ſome, that do tempt men unto
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:95016:173"/>Uncleanneſs; others, to Covetouſneſs; another, to Murder: another ſort of them tempt to Pride; for there are Devils in abundance, and whole troops that do manage one kind of ſin. And ſo likewiſe in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Judgments and Puniſhments, there are ſome that God maketh uſe of (as men are wont, in their way, to uſe and employ men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Capacities) to afflict in one kind; and then he ſets other Devils on work who are of another Occupation, and who know how to afflict men and women (ſuch perſons who have offended, whom he judgeth worthy to be chaſtiſed) in another kind. Methinks the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures give a little hint of this, where we read of ſome Devils that were dumb and deaf, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.17, 25, 26. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.32. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 11.14.</p>
               <p>The Devil may be called dumb, becauſe he doth inflict that kind of puniſhment, or affliction, which we call dumbneſs; and ſo likewiſe of others.</p>
               <p>If then any perſons be reduced to ſuch a kind of Lethargie, that they neither feel the one World, or the other; nor are enclined to labour after the concernments of the one, nor of the other. Such perſons as theſe may be ſaid to be filled with the ſpirit of heavineſs, flumber, or drowſineſs. This by the way. In the firſt place then take notice that there are a Generation of men and women which we can hardly ſay that they be filled with any Spirit, unleſs it be a ſpirit of drowſineſs or flumber.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing to be taken knowledge of by the way, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> is, that the ſame perſons at ſeveral times, and in different caſes, may be filled with the Spirit of God, and with the Spirit of Sathan; or (which is the ſame) with a contrary ſpirit; and this not only under the two different Eſtates of Regeneracy, and Unregeneracy (which was <hi>Paul's</hi> caſe:) but even under one and the ſame ſtate and condition of Regeneration; yea, and poſſibly of Unregeneracy alſo. A good man, that is full of the Spirit of God, if we ſpeak of him in his habitual eſtate and condition ordinarily, may yet at ſometimes be filled with the ſpirit of Sathan. From this laſt particular it followeth, that there are two kinds of being filled with the ſpirit of God, and proportionably two kinds of being filled with an unclean Spirit, the one actual, and for a time only; the other habitual and ſtanding. Now, though it be this habitual and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fulneſs of the Spirit of God that we chiefly intend to enquire after, and to propound ſome Characters of, yet ſomething may fall in, relating to the other alſo. He then that is filled with the Spirit of God ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and this in the ſtanding courſe of his life, yet is it very poſſible, that at ſome time Satan may get into him, and fill him with himſelf, with a luſting of his Spirit: And ſo on the contrary, A perſon, that is filled with an unclean ſpirit ordinarily, may at ſeveral times be prevented with the Spirit of God; that is, God may do by him as ſometimes he
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:95016:173"/>did by <hi>Balaam,</hi> the Spirit of God did ſo fill him that he ſpake and propheſied of great and excellent things; yet the truth is, that the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual frame of <hi>Balaam</hi> was a being filled with the ſpirit of the Devil: He had familiar converſe with the Devil, yet nevertheleſs at that turn he was filled with the Spirit of God, which put to ſilence that ſpirit of the Devil. So is it likewiſe poſſible, that upon him that is filled with the Spirit of God, the Devil may break in with a guſt of temptation; as (doubtleſs) <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf was a regenerate man, and a Diſciple of Chriſt, yet when he denied his Lord and Maſter Chriſt, and not only ſo, but forſwore him, with an Oath of Execration upon himſelf, that he knew him not, certainly Satan was in him. For what could he have done more if he had been filled with that unclean ſpirit? Yea, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, when he diſſembled at <hi>Antioch,</hi> when he complied with the Jews, and ſo endangered the truth of the Goſpel, and that liberty which was now brought unto the World, here alſo he was touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at leaſt with this unclean ſpirit. This is a ſecond thing by the way.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We may add that likewiſe (by the way) that in reference to many perſons, the queſtion now under conſideration is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> upon the matter no queſtion at all (I mean) in this reſpect, becauſe they are ſo manifeſtly, and ſo apparently filled with an unclean Spirit, one or more, that there is no place left for any conſiderable enquiry, whether they be filled with the Spirit of God or no: The reaſon is, becauſe they do plainly diſcover themſelves to be filled with the ſpirit of the World. Of this ſort of perſons are all thoſe who live, whether in the ſecret or open practice of thoſe ſins, whether one or more, which the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures expreſly declares to be inconſiſtent with an eſtate of Grace, and with Salvation, and for which the Holy Ghoſt excludeth them out of heaven. We have a liſt of ſeveral of theſe kinds of perſons drawn up by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Know ye not, that the unrighteous ſhall not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither Idolaters, nor Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Railers, nor Extortioners ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God</hi> (meaning, if they continue ſuch:) <hi>But you are waſhed,</hi> &amp;c. Some of theſe, with a clauſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement which taketh in more than are here named, we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where mentioned by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5 5, 6. <hi>For this ye know, that no Whoremonger, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nclean perſon, nor the Covetous man, who is an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hath any,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words, for becauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God upon the Children of diſobedience.</hi> It ſeemeth that there was in the Apoſtles daies ſuch a Generation of men, like unto which we have in theſe daies, who are called Rantors; who bear men in hand (being firſt deceived themſelves, they labour to deceive others alſo) that for ſuch things as theſe are, even all manner of abominations,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:95016:174"/>though they commit them, yet there is no ſuch thing as the wrath of God coming upon them: no; but they can follow theſe wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices with the greateſt liberty; and that they underſtand their liberty to be ſuch, that they may do ſuch things as theſe without any regret. So that concerning ſuch perſons as theſe, we need not ſpend time in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating the caſe, whether they be filled with the Spirit of God, or with ſome other Spirit contrary unto him: The caſe is evident enough without debate. As a man needs not a touchſtone for a Chip, or a piece of brown Paper, to try whether theſe be good Gold or no; theſe plainly enough diſcover themſelves to be no Gold without the Touchſtone, every mans ſenſe will inform him of it. So that the Queſtion propounded lately, is, chiefly or only to be managed between perſons that have ſome co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable or plauſible pretenſe to a being filled with the Spirit of God, and ſuch who have a real and ſubſtantial ground for ſuch a claim.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> That alſo is to be premiſed, and remembred by the way, that we do not intend to ſift or examine the difference between a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and an unregenerate eſtate, nor make a diſcovery of thoſe who have the ſanctifying Spirit of God in any degree from amongſt thoſe who totally want it; but only to ſearch after, and (if it may be) find out who they are that are really filled with the Spirit of God amongſt thoſe who pretend to ſuch a fulneſs, and how theſe may be manifeſted from the other.</p>
               <p>Fifthly (and laſtly) This alſo would be taken along with us, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> that the Spirit of God, being a voluntary Agent, doth not utter himſelf in all or every perſon whom he filleth with his preſence in all the variety of his gifts. And from hence it followeth, that men may be filled with the Spirit of God, in reſpect of ſome one of his operations, and yet make no appearance of the fulneſs of the Spirit in ſome other 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8, 9, 10. <hi>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of Wiſdom, to another the word of Knowledge, by the ſame Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. Here we may clearly ſee, that one and the ſelf ſame Spirit of God is able to fill ſeveral men with variety of gifts, with ſeveral kinds of filling: One may be filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in reſpect of Knowledge; another may be filled with the Spirit of God in reſpect of Wiſdom, and yet may not be filled with him in ſome other conſideration. But if you ask me the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Wiſdom and Knowledge, you may conceive it thus; Wiſdom implieth, a heavenly dexterity; a faculty and ability to apply general Rules or Sayings to particular Caſes; to be able to find out Rules whereby to reſolve Queſtions and Caſes which another man, who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the Spirit of Wiſdom, will not be able to ſee. As for inſtance, Our Saviour, when he was put to it by the Scribes and Phariſees to juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Fact of his Diſciples in plucking the Ears of Corn againſt their unjuſt Clamours, if he had not had a rich anointing of this gift of the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:95016:174"/>Spirit of Wiſdom, he would not have been able to find out a paſſage of Scripture to have juſtified this Practice of theirs (but you know where he findeth it) and to prove the lawfulneſs of what his Diſciples did. Have ye not read (ſaith he, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.3, 4.) what <hi>David</hi> did, and thoſe with him when they were hungry, how that they went to the Houſe of God, and eat the Shew-bread, which was not lawful for them to do? And ſo he gives another inſtance of the Prieſts Circumciſing on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, and yet they pollute not the Sabbath. Here he, by the Spirit of Wiſdom, findeth the grounds that are contained in theſe paſſages of Scriptures, laid up ſomewhat cloſe out of the way of the ordinary thoughts of men. It is like not any of the Apoſtles had been able to make uſe of theſe to plead their own cauſe; but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by reaſon of that Spirit of Wiſdom, did it effectually. There is the like gift of the Spirit to a degree which is diſcernable to thoſe that have eyes to diſcern. Men that are but of competent Judgments may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee that in ſome men the Spirit of God doth put forth himſelf in this great and happy gift of Wiſdom, making them able to find out grounds and paſſages of Scripture for the clearing and unfolding of ſuch queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and difficulties, which other men (and men that are more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, in their way, in ſome other gifts of the Spirit) are not able to do.</p>
               <p>Now Knowledge noteth an underſtanding of the general Rules them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the things themſelves which are delivered and aſſerted in the Scriptures. A man may have all Knowledge (as the Scriptures ſpeak) he may be able to repeat the whole Scriptures, from firſt to laſt, by heart, and give an account of the ſenſe and meaning of every obſcure and knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty paſſage. Such a man as can do this, is an excellent man too, and full of the Spirit of God, in reſpect of Knowledge; and yet this man (poſſibly) may not be able or dexterous to apply or bring thoſe things and general Principles that he knows, and ſute them with particular caſes and queſtions which are brought to him, and laid before him; whereas another that hath not half his knowlege may be able to do it, and to give a plainer and fuller ſatisfaction unto him that ſhall propound a Caſe or difficulty unto him. So that this we would have you take notice of by the way, that the Spirit of God hath variety of gifts; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not to eſtimate a man as not filled with the Spirit, becauſe he is not dexterous at every turn. Theſe things being premiſed, we now proceed to the Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Now then, whether a perſon, man or woman, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> who pretendeth to be filled with the Spirit of God, be indeed filled with this, or any other Spirit contrary unto it, may be diſcerned or diſcovered (for the moſt part) by theſe conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, When a man is of a cool, calm, and yielding temper, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment in his own matters, his own proper and perſonal concernments in the World, and upon occaſion ſhall be apt to be raiſed and ſtirred in
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:95016:175"/>his ſpirit about the things of God: this is a ſign of very great probability (at leaſt) that ſuch a perſon is full of the Spirit of God. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, The genius and property of the Spirit of God may be diſcerned and judged of by the nature and property of that Wiſdom <hi>which</hi> (as <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17.) <hi>is from above;</hi> and this, as he informs us, is <hi>firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſie to be entreated full of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> &amp;c. meaning, that it diſpoſeth men and women to thoſe worthy properties; that where it is received, it works their hearts and ſouls to theſe gracious diſpoſitions; it makes men firſt <hi>pure,</hi> it diſpoſeth and enclines men and women to avoid all pollution with ſin, above any other thing whatſoever; it perſwadeth men not to meddle, not to have to do with ſin upon any terms, whether of Pleaſure, Profit, Honour, or whatſoever: And then next to this, it teacheth men to be <hi>peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be entreated,</hi> &amp;c. which is to be underſtood chiefly in a mans own Affairs and Concernments, and in his ordinary Converſe with men; for otherwiſe, this Wiſdom teacheth men to be as ſtiff and reſolute, in the Affairs of Jeſus Chriſt and the Goſpel, as <hi>Paul</hi> was (<hi>Gal.</hi> 2.5.) when he yielded not, <hi>gave not place, no, not for an hour</hi> (as he ſaith) to certain falſe Brethren, who went about to incumber the Goſpel with matters of <hi>Judaiſm.</hi> And again, when he withſtood another to his face who was not a falſe Brother, but equal to himſelf, a great Apoſtle (I mean <hi>Peter</hi>) in a buſineſs of the Goſpel, wherein (as he ſaith) <hi>he was to be blamed,</hi> Verſe 11. and yet again, when he fought with <hi>beaſts at Epheſus after the manner of men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32. Now then, as it is the genius and property of that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom we ſpeak of, that Wiſdom which is from above, thus to mould and faſhion the minds and manners of men: So is it the property of the Spirit of God alſo to do the like; becauſe this Spirit worketh not upon men but by the mediation of this Wiſdom, and works only ſuch diſpoſitions and inclinations which this Wiſdom worketh. This then is that we ſay, that when men and women are very peaceably diſpoſed, and of a yielding and quiet ſpirit in their own worldly Affairs, and yet when occaſions require are apt to quit themſelves like men of courage and reſolution; this argues that they have a very rich anointing of the Spirit of God. I add this latter particular, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are apt to be zealous and ſtirred in Spirit, in and about the things of God, becauſe otherwiſe a ſoftneſs or quietneſs of diſpoſition about their own Affairs may be rather the reſult of their own natural complexion or conſtitution than any effect of the Wiſdom from above, or of the Spirit of God working in and by this Wiſdom. For though peaceableneſs of ſpirit, gentleneſs, eaſineſs to be entreated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be the fruits or effects <hi>of the wiſdom from above,</hi> [<hi>viz.</hi> in the moſt of thoſe in whom they are found] yet it doth not follow from thence, but that there may be, in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, impreſſions or qualities like unto theſe from another original or
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:95016:175"/>cauſe. The Woods, Paſtures, and Fields produce of their own accord ſome kind of Herbs and Fruits like unto thoſe, and of the ſame name or denomination with thoſe which grow in our Gardens by ſowing, ſetting, and planting; yet are they but of a wild kind and nature, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo fair nor fit for uſe as theſe, every palate will be able to diſtinguiſh between the one and the other. As it is between thoſe two ſorts of of <hi>Eunuches,</hi> which our Saviour diſtinguſheth in the Goſpel thus, that ſome are ſuch from their <hi>mothers wombs,</hi> others <hi>have made themſelves ſuch (Eunuchs) for the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 19.12. Meaning, that they have been perſwaded and prevailed with by the Goſpel to embrace a ſingle life, that ſo they might with more freedom of mind, and with leſs diſtraction and incumbrance of ſecular Affairs, attend the Service of God and of his Goſpel; intimating withal, that the former kind of <hi>Eunuch</hi> was little conſiderable with God, little ſet by in compariſon of this latter. In like manner, ſome have a kind of goodneſs, and facile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of diſpoſition, with ſome other impreſſions of morality, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in their kind, and commodious to a degree, both unto the perſons themſelves who are endued with them, and unto others, which yet ſpring naturally in them; but theſe are not like unto thoſe of the ſame name or denomination that are begotten and planted in the hearts and inward parts of men and women by the Goſpel and Miniſtry of it. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is termed the incorruptible Seed of the Word, which liveth for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. There is a kind of excellency and glory which goes along with the Word of God, which leaves a lively Impreſſion or Character of it ſelf upon thoſe holy diſpoſitions and qualifications which are planted or begotten by it in the hearts and ſouls of men, which doth diſtinguiſh them from thoſe moral qualifications, planted in men and women by the hand of Nature. But this only by the way. The ſum of what we laid down in the Character or Rule of Dijudication (now in hand) whereby to judge of men and women that be filled with the Spirit of God, is this; He that is as a weaned Child in his own Matters, but is ſtrong and active as a Giant in the Affairs of Jeſus Chriſt and of the Goſpel, he (I ſay) is like to be a perſon ſo filled with the Holy Ghoſt: But if a man be forward, and full of heat in the matters of Religion, and the ſame alſo, of the ſame hot temper in his own private Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his heat in matters of Religion may be but of the ſame account with other mens coldneſs; I mean, may be nothing elſe but his natural temper, and ſo argue no fulneſs of the Spirit of God. I confeſs, it is poſſible, that he that is ſomewhat warm, and ſomewhat apt to be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his ſpirit about his Worldly Affairs, and withal is zealouſly affected with and about the things of God, may be filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. But however the Judgment of this latter heat is taken away by the former: though ſuch a mans zeal in the things of God may proceed from a fulneſs of the Spirit of God in him, yet his heat other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:95016:176"/>drowns the Argument of it: This heat we ſpeak of, in his World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Affairs, though it doth not contradict the reality or truth of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with the Spirit, yet it contradicteth and deſtroyeth the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, proof, or manifeſtation of it. The reaſon why I conceive that ſome fervour of ſpirit, in a mans own occaſions, may poſſibly conſiſt with a fulneſs of the Spirit of God (in which caſe a mans zeal for God muſt needs proceed from ſuch a fulneſs) is, becauſe the Spirit of God, even when the heart and ſoul is to a good degree filled with him, doth not alwaies diſſolve the natural frame of the heart in ſuch diſpoſitions which are not ſinful, or not apprehended to be ſinful. And many times we find men who are flames of fire in their own occaſions, yet like ſo many dul clods of earth in the things of Jeſus Chriſt; yea, this is the ordinary temper of the generality of men, even of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors themſelves, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. <hi>All men ſeek their own, not the things of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In this caſe, when he that <hi>ſeeketh,</hi> or hitherto hath ſought his own things with zeal and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, but hath been remiſs and cold in the things of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be reduced to greater zeal for the things of Jeſus Chriſt than for his own, this change in him muſt needs proceed from the Spirit of God, yea, from a great work of this Spirit in him; and conſequently, ſuch a Perſon, continuing thus zealous for Chriſt, may well be conceived to be full of the Spirit of Chriſt, notwithſtanding he be ſomewhat zealous of his own Cauſe and Affairs alſo. Now the reaſon hereof is, becauſe his heat in his own Affairs is but ſomewhat of the natural frame of his heart, which is not diſſolved by the Spirit of God, it not being apprehended to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. I confeſs, there is a kind of zeal in a mans ſecular and worldly Affairs, which is found in too many, which is hardly, if at all conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with a being filled with the Spirit; this is that which the Apoſtle calleth, <hi>A warring after the fleſh.</hi> Now, What is this ſame warring after the fleſh? It is to be importunely troubleſome unto the World, to quarrel almoſt with every man that comes in our way, and with whom we have to do, about theſe outward things and accommodations. When men fight, they lay out their ſtrength, and all they have, as Souldiers, they do it with all their might and power: So when men are zealous to ſuch a degree, for their own Affairs, that the managing and providing for them is a kind of Warfare, wherein they are acted by the fleſh, and by the deſires, luſts, and unreaſonable motions of it, ſo as to quarrel and contend with every man that ſtands in their way; ſuch a kind of zeal in men (which appeareth in thus warring according to the fleſh) teſtifieth unto their Faces, that certainly they are not filled with the Spirit of God. There is (indeed) another kind of zeal, which you may conceive better of, and this is a kind of diligence in your Affairs, which is worthy of commendation: For men, being diligent in their Callings, by this means declare themſelves to be Loyal Servants of
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:95016:176"/>Jeſus Chriſt: if he ſet them about their own work, then they will ſerve him there; if he ſet them on work for himſelf, there they will ſerve him alſo: In ſuch a kind of heat as this there is ſomewhat that anſwers unto, and is conſiſtent with a fulneſs of the Spirit of God. But when men are hot, fiery, and fierce in their own things, and likewiſe fierce in the things of God; their being hot in the things of God is an Argument of no weight, no way convincing, that they are filled with the Spirit.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Rule for diſcovery of thoſe who are filled with the Spirit of God, from thoſe who are not filled with him, but with a contrary Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> may be this; when men and women have the command of their Spirits, ſo as to keep them in and let them out, to cauſe them to riſe and to fall, to go and to come, according to the true exigency of the affairs of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the real benefit of men. For when men are alwaies, and in all caſes alike hot and fiery, or elſe alike cold and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and put no difference between times and times, occaſions and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, perſons and perſons, it is an argument or ſign of great probability, and which ſeldom faileth, that there is no great preſence of the Spirit of God with them, and that that zeal and heat wherein ſome men, upon all occaſions, and without any difference made between any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances appear, is but either a kind of natural temper (or, which is worſe) ſome affected ſtrain of hypocriſie. It is a Promiſe made by God unto thoſe that will cauſe their ear to hearken unto Wiſdom, <hi>And encline their heart to underſtanding,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 2.2. compared with <hi>ver</hi> 9.) <hi>That they ſhall underſtand righteouſneſs and judgment,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of judgment,</hi> &amp;c. I conceive he means theſe two things: Firſt, A diſcerning and underſtanding what is meet and worthy to be done upon all occaſions, according to the regular and due exigency and requirements of every of them reſpectively; And ſecondly, An heart and inward diſpoſition to do every thing accordingly. Now, when men and women thus, and in this ſenſe, <hi>underſtand judgment;</hi> that is, know how to riſe and fall in their ſpirits, how to change and temper their behaviour and ſpeech; when to be authoritative, ſtout, and reſolute; and again familiar, gentle, and ſubmiſſive, according as the perſons are with whom, and according to the nature of the occaſions and affairs, wherein they have to do; and this in order to the glorifying of God, and the juſtifying of his Wiſdom; it is an Argument of much weight to prove that they have a rich anointing of the Spirit of God. We find <hi>Paul</hi> a man very excellent and active in all the variety of theſe ſpiritual poſtures we ſpeak of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19, 20, &amp;c. <hi>For though</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I be free from all men, yet have I made my ſelf a Servant unto all:</hi> To the Jew I became a Jew, unto them that are under the Law as under the Law, to them that are without the Law as without the Law; to the weak I became weak; I became all things to all that by all means I might win ſome. <hi>Paul</hi> had gone ſo to work with himſelf, that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:95016:177"/>he had brought himſelf to a conformity to all occaſions and kinds of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and could comply with all for their benefit. When men ſhall ſee the carriage and deportment of a man, and ſhall not be able to ſee what the natural temper and genius of the man is; when they ſhall ſee him in ſuch variety of action, and all that which he doth to become him, to have beauty and reaſon in it; this is a ſign that the man thus endued hath a very rich and glorious anointing of the Spirit of God in him: But when mens natural tempers do encreaſe in them, ſo as that theſe will have part and ſhare in their actings, it is a ſign that Nature is not thoroughly broken, nor wholly ſubdued, but that there is ſomewhat yet more for the Spirit of God to do. Elſewhere he demandeth of theſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.21. <hi>What will you? Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the Spirit of meekneſs?</hi> From whence it appears, that <hi>Paul</hi> could upon occaſion both uſe the rod of Apoſtolical Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, where he ſaw cauſe, and take vengeance on diſobedience (as he ſpeaketh elſewhere:) And could likewiſe demean himſelf with gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards Chriſtians, even as a Nurſe cheriſheth, and is tender over her Children (as he ſpeaketh of himſelf) 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7. In matters of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſtate, he knew (as he ſaith) both <hi>how to be abaſed, i. e.</hi> to want, <hi>and how to abound, Phil.</hi> 4.12. Meaning, that he was able and knew how to manage both eſtates, Adverſity, and Proſperity, according to ſuch Rules by which theſe conditions ought to be managed reſpectively; yea, and may be managed to the glory of God, and likewiſe to the comfort and contentment of men that partake in either. And, as he ſaith, he knew how to be <hi>abaſed,</hi> and how <hi>to abound;</hi> ſo likewiſe in his deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he knew how to ſtoop to the ground, and to ſit upon a Dunghil with thoſe that were Poor, and weak, and of Low degree in the Church of Chriſt: And he knew likewiſe how to be a Companion for Princes, and to ſtand up with the higheſt and greateſt of all, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of greateſt eſteem. <hi>Paul</hi> (we know) had a ſpirit that was able to reſiſt even <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, one of the greateſt Pillars of the Chriſtian Faith then in the World, and to withſtand him to his face when there was juſt occaſion ſo to do. My Brethren, He that knew how to do this, muſt needs have a mighty command of himſelf: For take him at another turn, when the ſtate of buſineſſes was altered, and when he was in the preſence of poor and weak Saints, he could act another part, and quit himſelf like a poor and weak man, as if he had nothing of the carriage or of the reſolution of a man in him. Thus Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to whom the Spirit was given not by meaſure (as <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34.) is compared in Scripture as well to a Lamb as to a Lion, and is preſented unto the World under both theſe Denominations; one while he is called the <hi>Lamb</hi> of God; another while he is called <hi>The Lion of the Tribe of Judah;</hi> to ſhew, that he knows how to act the properties of both, according as he judgeth ſeaſonable and meet. When
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:95016:177"/>he cometh to thoſe who are poor in Spirit, he bleſſeth, and ſpeaketh in a ſtill voice unto them; and when he hath to do with the Scribes and Phariſees, then he pronounceth with a loud voice, <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees, hyppocrites.</hi> Now his Spirit was up on high, and full of courage and undaunted reſolution: Yea, now he is in heaven, and aſcended <hi>to the right hand of the Majeſty on high,</hi> Heb. 1.3. Yet doth he ſtill retain the ſame qualifications or diſpoſitions. To many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he doth behave himſelf like a Lamb, with much ſweetneſs and great condeſcention; and otherwhile he can roar like a Lion upon others, and appear in judgment when he ſeeth his time, and when the exigencies of the buſineſs which is before him requireth it.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> why I conceive that ſuch a ſweet conſorting of a mans ſpirit and behaviour to all variety of occaſions which he can meet with from time to time, muſt needs be a great Argument of a rich anointing of the Spirit, is this; partly becauſe to diſtinguiſh exactly between the Exigencies of Occaſions requireth a very excellent degree of Wiſdom, a much refined Underſtanding; and partly alſo, becauſe it requireth a great command of a mans ſpirit, a depreſſing or diſſolution of a mans natural temper, whatever it was, to be able to apply himſelf only and conſcienciouſly to all variety of occaſions reſpectively; both which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a large and liberal preſence of the Spirit of God in men; partly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, becauſe it is ſo rare a ſight to ſee a Perſon, man or woman, even amongſt Believers themſelves, in whoſe Converſations and Deportments that ſavory, wiſe, and conſciencious comportment with the various na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Exigencies of occaſions is to be found. Firſt, I ſay, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand judgment (as the Scripture Phraſe is) to know what is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and worthy for a Chriſtian to do, at all times and caſes, requires a great ſpiritualneſs of underſtanding; to apprehend how the feries and tenour of all a mans actions may be made ſpiritually harmonious, when to riſe, and when to fall, and when to keep a middle ſtrain between high and low, as every of theſe reſpective carriages may beſt accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the intereſt of God in the World (I mean, his honour and praiſe) and the intereſt likewiſe of men; this requireth an heart in ſome degree like unto <hi>Solomons;</hi> which the Scriptures compare <hi>to the ſands that are upon the Sea-ſhore,</hi> 1 Kings 4.29. Now the heart of <hi>Solomon</hi> is ſaid to be large, like unto the ſands of the Sea-ſhore, which are not to be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, becauſe he had a world of notions and apprehenſions in his mind or underſtanding, by reaſon whereof he was able to underſtand moſt exactly how he ought to behave himſelf upon all occaſions, and how to ſute himſelf with the Exigency of every affair; he had all circumſtances before him, and he turned them and weighed them in his hand, and therefore (ſaith he, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.1, 2, &amp;c.) There is a time for every purpoſe under the Sun; A time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a time to build and a time to break down, a time to weep and a
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:95016:178"/>time to rejoyce, a time to caſt away ſtones and a time to gather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, he muſt be a wiſe man indeed (as he ſpeaketh, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.5, 6.) <hi>Whoſe heart diſcerneth time and judgment, i. e.</hi> that is able to diſcern the time and ſeaſon for one Action, or one kind of deportment from that which is proper for another; to know with what Perſons, and in what Caſes to deal in a ſpirit of Meekneſs and Sweetneſs, and when to deal with men in Fire, Earthquake, and Thunder; and when to hold a courſe between both, and to know how proportionably to meaſure out by drams and ſcruples a behaviour ſutable to all caſes, ſuch as will make a man harmonious with himſelf, and not to be over-bearing when that which is leſs will beſt become him, and ſo not be light where a greater weight is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> Many men may be better provided at this point, at the intellectual part, and for matter of underſtanding and diſcerning times and ſeaſons than they are at the ſecond, which is a readineſs, an aptneſs to comport with theſe actions or occaſions; for (alas!) there is not one man or woman of many that do live up to their light. <hi>If ye know theſe things</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> As it requireth a rich anointing of the Spirit of God to diſcern times and ſeaſons, ſo doth it no leſs to have a mans heart throughly broken and ſubdued under him, to comply with them. Doubtleſs many perſons know the neceſſity of duties, yea, of many highly acceptable and beneficial things, which yet their hearts will not ſerve them to come up unto: Their eyes are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally better than their hearts, their apprehenſions are more raiſed and full, and their affections more ſlow and heavie within them: And therefore ſecondly, For men to have all things that may render them apt to all due and regular compliance with all ſervices incumbent on them, this doth require a marvelous degree of ſelf-denial and mortification; for the heart of a man is exceeding ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ff, and will not bend nor bow, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in ſuch and ſuch caſes that fall in with the natural frame and temper of it: But for a man to be univerſally comportant and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all thoſe ſpiritual occaſions and affairs of God that come in his way, this will never be done, a mans heart will never ſtand upon ſuch terms, until it be mightily broken, until the Spirit of God have pulled down that building of the Old man, and have not left one ſtone thereof upon another. It is true, the heart of a man requires much hammer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before this building of the Old man will fall, before the fleſh and luſts thereof will be ſubdued: But would men be faithful unto the intereſt of their own ſouls, this bleſſed work might be accompliſhed. For the Word of God is abundantly furniſhed, there is enough in it wherewithal to ſubdue that (or thoſe luſts) which are moſt diſturbing, enough quite to change and alter the property and conſtitution of a man, and to reduce thoſe that are moſt froward to the greateſt gentleneſs, and thoſe that are moſt fiery and turbulent in their Spirits to the greateſt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:95016:178"/>Meekneſs and Patience. I ſay, If men would but ſet that Wiſdom which is from above on work upon their hearts and Spirits, this would fill up all the Valleys, and bring down all the Mountains, and reduce the frame of the heart and ſoul of ſuch a man who thus imployeth it into a conformity with it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> in Purity, Peaceableneſs, Gentleneſs, and an eaſineſs to be intreated. My Brethren, we do admire (and we have cauſe ſo to do) at that excellent temper of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> how active he was, he could ſtop the Fleſh (as it were) with a curb in the midſt of its Career; like a Horſe that is excellently taught, that will ſtop in the midſt of his way with the leaſt check of the Bit or Bridle: So <hi>Paul's</hi> heart being broken and diſciplined by means of the Goſpel, and by his own care and induſtry was brought to that ſame paſs. And doubtleſs we have the ſame Word and Goſpel that he had, and if we had but the ſame mind, we might be as excellent even as he himſelf was; if we did but love that ſame more excellent way as he did, what hindereth, or what is there in the way between him and the pooreſt Chriſtian of all? He ſaith he laboured more abundantly than they all, and therefore no marvel that he got ſo far before them in the Race. But if we reſpect our ſelves and the generality of Chriſtians in theſe daies, no marvel if we lie in the very Center of the Earth, and have made ſo little advance in waies of excellency; and that on the other hand, we are not deſcended ſo much as one degree lower from that height and pride of ſpirit which we firſt began withal, and which we found in our ſelves when we ſet upon the work of Mortification: I ſay, it is no marvel, if we conſider how exceedingly indiſpoſed Chriſtians (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) are to ſpiritual labour, without which theſe things cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. This for the ſecond particular. But then,</p>
               <p>The third (and laſt) is this. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> The rarity and fewneſs of ſuch perſons in the World who do thus genuinely and kindly anſwer unto, and ſuite their ſpirits and deportments with all occaſions and circumſtances that come in their way. There are very few that are expert in the Word of God, and that can, or are willing to take the pains to be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between an ordinary preſence of the Spirit, and that which we are ſpeaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> a being filled with the Spirit, and therefore ſit down and content themſelves without ſtriving after it. I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but the Spirit of God is abroad in the world, and that he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in many of your hearts and ſouls. But though I would be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent unto your ſpiritual credit and repute to the utmoſt that I am able, yet I cannot believe any ſuch thing concerning you, that all of you are what you ought to be, and what you might very well be. The commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity indeed is rich, but it is very coſtly; yet if you would go to the price of it, it is to be had at the hand of Jeſus Chriſt: But according to the preſent ſize and ſtate of Chriſtianity, and the Profeſſours thereof in the World, there are very few to be found of that excellent Character
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:95016:179"/>we ſpeak of; but that their natural Temper, Humour, and Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be found in their actions; they will be ſtiff, and not fall in, nor comply gently, nor ſweetly with many occaſions; when they ſhould quit themſelves like men of courage, not regarding the faces of men, their hearts will not ſerve them, but they are meal-mouthed, they dare not ſpeak, they are afraid to offend ſuch and ſuch a man. Otherwhile, when they have occaſion to treat about any buſineſs, with thoſe that are low and mean, then you ſhall have them high, and ſurly, and over-bearing; Now in theſe caſes, this ſame unworthy Principle of their Nature (as we may call it) ſhews it ſelf. I cannot (by the way) brook that term, for there is nothing ſimply unworthy in nature, but what ſin and the unworthineſs of the hearts of men have put into it. It is hard and exceeding rare to find perſons ſo filled with the Spirit of God, that they do not give ſome ſuch ſign or teſtimony, as now we ſpeak of; ſomething to diſcover their temper, humour, and ſuch kind of Principles within them, that make them ſtiff that they cannot bow nor comply. Their Iron Sinew is not yet broken, they have not taken the courſe, they have not dealt effectually with their hearts to bring them into ſubjection; they have not chaſtened their Souls every morning (as <hi>David</hi> did) who had diſciplined and nurtured his heart to ſome kind of order and compliance with God in all his occaſions and affairs. And ſo much for this Direction, or the ſecond Rule given, by which we may know whether men be filled with the Spirit of God; namely, if they underſtand judgment (as the Scriptures ſpeak) and then be ready in their hearts and affections to concur and to meaſure out to every caſe and buſineſs according to the exigency, and requirements of it: this now doth declare an excellent degree of the fulneſs of the Spirit of God with them. And</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> A deep degree of Mortification, eſpecially, when the work is uniform, ſpreading and ſtretching it ſelf, with an equal force and power unto all a mans Affections, Diſpoſition, and Deſires which ought to be mortified with the Deeds, Fruits, and Works of them. This (I ſay) is another great Argument or ſign of a man or womans being filled with the Spirit of God. The work of Mortification is performable only by the Spirit of God; and therefore where it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and wrought thoroughly, where it appears in any degree of glory, it muſt needs argue a great preſence of the Spirit; <hi>For if ye live after the fleſh</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ye ſhall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,</hi> Rom. 8.13. If you ask me, But why doth the Apoſtle place the great work of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the deeds of the body, in having theſe mortified, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in thoſe ſinful affections and inward diſpoſitions from whence they proceed? I reply; That he placeth it here in the deeds of the body, becauſe it is principally ſeen, and the reality and truth of it found
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:95016:179"/>there: though the work it ſelf lieth moſt in the heart and inward man, yet the energy and force chiefly appeareth in the aboliſhing or ceſſation of the deeds of the fleſh, or of the body. When ſuch ſinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy actions ceaſe to be found in men and women, whereunto others are tempted by the fleſh, or by the occaſions of the fleſh, and ever and anon are practicing of them, it is a ſign that the work of Mortification is real and in truth; yet elſewhere the ſame Apoſtle placeth it in the affections and luſts of the fleſh, in having theſe crucified or mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>and luſts thereof,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with the paſſions <hi>i. e.</hi> with all thoſe affections which belong to the iraſcible part of the ſoul (as both Philoſophers and Divines call it) Anger, Wrath, Hatred, Envy, Revenge, <hi>&amp;c. they have crucified theſe, i.e.</hi> they have taken a courſe to break the ſtrength, and to ſuppreſs the motions and breakings out of theſe; <hi>And the luſts, i.e.</hi> all thoſe affections alſo which belong to the other part of the ſoul, which they call the <hi>Concupiſcible,</hi> ſuch as are Fornication, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, Drunkenneſs, Gluttony, Covetouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So then (we ſay) that when the Fleſh, with the Affections, and Luſts, and Deeds thereof are ſo crucified or mortified, ſo handled that men and women are become Meek, Patient, Humble, Gentle, long-ſuffering, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And again, Chaſte, Pure, Sober, Temperate, free from Covetouſneſs, and all this to an excellent degree, it is a ſign that they are full of the Spirit of God; the reaſon is, becauſe,</p>
               <p>Firſt, If theſe things be in any weak and imperfect degree in men, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> they proceed from the Spirit of God, and muſt be wrought by him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, A being filled with the Spirit is no waies to be eſtimated and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerned but by a proportionable excellency or fulneſs of his operations and effects. Now the work of mortification (as hath been in part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed) is one of the moſt ſignal works of the Spirit, and therefore where it is full, or any thing rich and deep, it argues a great preſence of the Spirit; but the truth is, it is very hard to be found in any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as that we ſpeak of, even amongſt Profeſſours, yea, or Believers themſelves. Men and women have (generally) ſome ſinful humours and diſpoſitions or other unbroken and unſubdued; either they are Cholerick, Haſty, Froward, eaſily Provoked, Revengeful, and the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:95016:180"/>like; or elſe they are given to Pleaſures, Eaſe, Voluptuouſneſs of life, deſires of Riches, Honour, Power (the great things of the World.) And though many keep within ſome tolerable compaſs, in reſpect of the breaking out of theſe, and ſuch like unmortified affections, whilſt the Tempter keepeth at a diſtance from them, and ſome few (it may be) whilſt the Temptations runs ſomewhat low, and are but ordinary; yet the greateſt part of the perſons we ſpeak of (Profeſſors I mean) are apt to be overcome, and led away Captive unto Sin by every touch of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; any Temptation (almoſt) that will may ſerve it ſelf upon them: Even as ſome mens Judgments are ſo weak, that they are apt to be carried about with every wind of Doctrine (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) apt to take impreſſions of any thing that is preſented unto them with the lighteſt appearance of truth; but to find a man or woman that is able to ſtand their ground of innocency, when any ſtrong temptations beare hard upon them, is exceeding rare: which argues the work of Mortification to be very imperfect and ſlight in the greateſt part of men, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that they are far from being filled with the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>If it be here demanded, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> But are not all the works of the Spirit of God perfect? If he work Mortification in any perſon, muſt it not needs be perfect? Can any thing proceed from that which is perfect, yea, moſt perfect (as the Spirit of God is) but that which is perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed?</p>
               <p>I reply, The perfection of a work may be eſtimated, or conſidered two waies: Firſt, Abſolutely, or in reference only to it ſelf. Or elſe ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Relatively; I mean, in reference to other things, to certain ends or purpoſes, which are not eſſential unto the work. In the former conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration or ſenſe, a work is ſaid to be perfect when it is ſo well and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly performed, that no degrees of perfection are wanting, or can be added to it. In the latter ſenſe, a work is ſaid to be perfect when it is wrought after ſuch a manner, or upon ſuch terms, that it accommodates ſome ends and purpoſes of greater weight and moment than a ſudden or preſent perfection of the work it ſelf. To explain this diſtinction a little, and then briefly to apply it. God (we know) in the courſe of Nature, though (as the Apoſtle ſaith) he giveth to every Seed its own body, yet he doth this gradually. As our Saviour in his Parable (<hi>Mar.</hi> 4.28.) expreſſeth it concerning the Seed or Grain of Corn, <hi>Firſt, the blade, then the ear, and then the ripe or full corn in the Ear.</hi> Now the work of Providence, in bringing the Seed that is ſown thus by degrees to perfection, is in this reſpect at firſt, and for a time after, <hi>viz.</hi> until the ripe Corn in the Ear, imperfect; becauſe after the ſpringing up of the Blade, and after the Ear, there remains ſomewhat further to be done to bring there to their natural and due perfection, <hi>i.e.</hi> to be ripe Corn in the Ear. But now look upon this work of Providence in another
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:95016:180"/>conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is ſubſervient to ſuch ends and purpoſes as God projecteth to bring to paſs by it, <hi>viz.</hi> to exerciſe the Faith and Patience of the Husbandman in waiting upon him a convenient ſpace for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the fruit of his Labour; and ſo to diſplay his own Wiſdom in the orderly Progreſſion of Nature, or ſecond cauſes; and ſo it is perfect all along from firſt to laſt, and under every degree or advance of it, and would have been leſs perfect in caſe it had been carried on and wrought otherwiſe; I mean, in caſe the Seed that is ſown ſhould preſently upon the ſowing be brought to perfection, or full Corn in the Ear. Though this had been perfect in the former conſideration, yet in the latter it would have been imperfect, and ſo would not have accommodated the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman in his waiting with patience.</p>
               <p>Now to apply the diſtinction; All the works of the Spirit in men, the work of Faith, the work of Repentance, or Mortification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are all perfect in the latter ſenſe, but not in the former. We read in the Scripture as well of a little Faith as of a great Faith; and a little Faith is the work of the Spirit as well as that which is great: Yet a little Faith, ſimply conſidered, is an imperfect work, becauſe many degrees remain to be added to it, to perfect or complete it; but, in the latter conſideration, the work of a little Faith in men, and ſo of a lower degree of Mortification, is as perfect a work as a greater.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is, becauſe the Spirit in working a work of little Faith, and not of greater accommodates the righteous and wiſe Counſel or Deſign of God; <hi>viz.</hi> in rewarding mens Labour, Diligence, and Faithfulneſs proportionably to their degrees; not making thoſe who have been leſs diligent and faithful (though both in ſome degree) equal unto thoſe who have abounded in theſe above their Fellows. Now we know the Wiſdom and the Holineſs of God have in conſultation the promotion of Godlineſs in the World upon the higheſt and beſt terms that may be. And among many waies and means wherein the God of Grace doth intend to expreſs himſelf for the promoting this great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of his, there is no means more effectual than this way, <hi>viz.</hi> That thoſe who will be more diligent, and more laborious, and more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſhall more and more apply themſelves to the uſe of ſuch and ſuch means; that they ſhall be inveſted with ſuch and ſuch Priviledges in a greater meaſure. Whereas if God ſhould do that upon any uſe of means, <hi>viz.</hi> if they ſhall pray once a month, or hear the Word once a month; if God ſhall give as much; and as rich a preſence of himſelf unto ſuch a perſon as unto him who ſhall be diligent in the uſe of means: Then, or by means of ſuch a procedure, God ſhould pull down that with one hand which he endeavoureth to build up with the other; and would by ſuch a courſe take men off from the uſe of means; for, Who would give double or treble to procure that which he might have at a
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:95016:181"/>lower rate? This for a third ſign or means of diſcerning who are filled with the Spirit; a deep and effectual work of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> Another thing which argueth a man or woman to be filled with the Spirit of God is, ſome worthy degree of Holineſs, where a Spirit of holineſs breaths uniformly, and with an equal tenour of life and converſation in the World. We have heretofore ſhewed what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs (in the ſenſe we now ſpeak of it) is, <hi>viz.</hi> a gracious impreſſion or propenſion, enclining the heart and ſoul where it reſideth unto waies and actions eminently righteous and juſt, with a real abhorrency of the contrary, or of whatſoever is ſinful. Indeed, that holineſs which we now ſpeak of ſeemeth chiefly to conſiſt in the latter; A real loathing, abhorring, and deteſting what is ſinful and unclean, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.17. <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his waies, and holy in all his works. Righteous in all his waies, i. e.</hi> All his waies, and works, and diſpenſations, all his interpoſures in the World with every Creature are all righteous and juſt: He meaneth juſt in ſuch a ſenſe as men are able to call juſt; for elſe to what purpoſe was it to inform the World that God was juſt and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and then to mean it to be ſuch a kind of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs which men cannot underſtand? And holy in all his works; I ſuppoſe it is according to the manner of the Scriptures, where uſually in the latter Clauſe of the Verſe there is ſome Explication made of the former. And ſo here, the Holy Ghoſt having ſaid, <hi>The Lord is righteous in all his waies</hi> (he addeth) <hi>and he is holy in all his works:</hi> As if he had ſaid, He is not ſimply in all that he doth juſt and regular: No, but he doth abhor with a perfect hatred all things that are contrary. We know, a man may do a thing out of ſuch or ſuch an affection or diſpoſition, or in reference to ſuch an end that he would provide for and accompliſh; and yet poſſibly he may do the contrary: But now (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, there is ſuch a mighty propenſity, and going out of his heart and ſoul to holineſs in all his works that he cannot do otherwiſe; he hath the greateſt abhorrency in his nature to do otherwiſe. As the Wiſeman ſaith in the <hi>Proverbs, It is joy to the upright to do juſtly;</hi> that is, the Propenſions of their heart and ſoul ſtand for ſuch actions. Now all Actions which are ſutable to a ſtrong Propenſity in a man are actions of joy and great delight unto him; ſo that to do juſtly and righteouſly when the heart is full of this diſpoſition muſt needs be matter of joy and of high contentment; it muſt needs eaſe the heart and ſoul that is filled with this fulneſs. And ſo God taketh a pleaſure in mercy; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is his delight, becauſe he is full of mercy, his Nature and Eſſence is full of theſe gracious Principles, theſe ſweet and bleſſed affections, and ſo likewiſe Righeouſneſs is his delight; as on the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is planted in his Nature a deep and unſpeakable deteſtation and abhorrence of that which is ſinful and unrighteous, therefore he cannot come near any ſuch Action.</p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:95016:181"/>
               <p>Now the reaſon why I make a worthy or conſiderable degree in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs an Argument or ſign of a mans being filled with the Spirit of God, is, becauſe the Spirit of God is a Spirit of Holineſs. And according to the common Maxime in Reaſon and in Natural Philoſophy. <hi>Omne Agens aſſimilat ſibi patiens,</hi> &amp;c. Every Agent endeavoureth to make the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent like himſelf, as fire would make all hot.</p>
               <p>So water doth moyſten and ſoften all that doth come near unto it, and that will mingle with it. The Spirit (we know) is from place to place in the Scriptures ſtiled the Holy Spirit; this is his proper Name or Character by which he is diſtinguiſhed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom</hi> [or by whom] <hi>alſo after that ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of Promiſe.</hi> He is here diſtinguiſhed from all other Spirits, and termed the holy Spirit, <hi>In whom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>after that ye believed ye were ſealed with the holy Spirit of Promiſe:</hi> that is, the Spirit promiſed by God, or by Jeſus Chriſt unto Believers. Only this is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred by way of Caution, when any perſon is wont to appear in the Form of holineſs, in reſpect of any great and ſolemn deteſtation of ſome things or waies that are evil (as it is obſervable in ſome, that they have a great fierceneſs, and, as it were, a fierce keen edge of Spirit againſt ſome kind of ſins) but are remiſs, lukewarm, and neutral in reſpect of others, being manifeſt and generally known or acknowledged to be ſins: This is no Argument of perſons being filled with the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?</hi> So when men ſhall abhor one kind of ſin, or abomination, but yet either practice or paſs by, or connive at, and are not troubled at the practice of another, this is a ſign that it is not from the Spirit of God, or from any fulneſs with this Spirit that that abhorrence and deteſtation of that particular ſin doth proceed; and conſequently, this is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of any great worth or value to prove that a man is filled with the Spirit of God. And thus you have many great pretenders unto holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and conſequently, to a being filled with the Spirit, by this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of truth diſcovered to be nothing ſo. There may be (indeed) other reaſons and other motives that may put them forth in a deteſtation of ſome ſins; but if there be other ſins that they can ſuffer without any trouble or regret of ſoul, certainly, this is not the Spirit of God that worketh. For he never teacheth men to put any ſuch difference between abomination and abomination.</p>
               <p>A fifth Particular, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> by which a man or woman may be diſcerned to be filled with the Spirit of God, is, if they be eminently godly; if God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs hath its perfect work in them, <hi>i. e.</hi> if they be all really and in good earneſt ſolicitous and careful that their waies and actions may have a direct, clear, and proper tendency to the glorifying or manifeſting of God in the World; when men without much regret or reluctancy, or much pain unto the Fleſh, can accommodate all their occaſions and
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:95016:182"/>affairs to the intereſt of God and his glory. This is a great ſign of their being filled with the Spirit of God. For as we have formerly ſhewed unto you that as the heavineſs of a Stone carries it downwards to its Center, juſt ſo Godlineſs maketh the Soul hang Godward, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, diſpoſeth a man to a kind of ſolicitouſneſs in all his waies, that theſe may all lead in a ſtraite Line unto the magnifying of God, and the advancing of his glory.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why we deliver this as a Property or Character of a mans being filled with the Spirit, is, firſt, becauſe the Spirit who is ſaid to be of God, or from God, cannot but be conceived to be for God alſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> perſwade and encline men to make God and his Glory their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign end, and to ſet him up and his Intereſt here as the higheſt and ſupreme end of all their undertakings, and of all their Counſels and dealings in the World. And ſecondly, The motions and workings of the Spirit in the hearts and ſouls of men, being every way concurrent with the Goſpel (for the Spirit moveth not, ſtirreth not, doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline any mans heart or ſoul but in conſort, and in a full and expreſs concurrence with the Goſpel, with the Sayings, Precepts, and Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hereof.) And the Goſpel being calculated, as it were on purpoſe, with the moſt exact and beſt Skill, and Wiſdom, and Underſtanding to promote Godlineſs; being a Doctrine according unto Godlineſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> a Doctrine framed and made on purpoſe to promote Godlineſs in the World; a Doctrine of ſuch a nature and import, as if God had a deſire by means hereof to ſet up himſelf, and to draw men unto himſelf: Now then (I ſay) the Spirit never working but with a full concurrence with the Goſpel, and the Goſpel being ſet for Godlineſs, and for the advancement of it in the World; it cannot be but that the Spirit of God muſt ſet the heart on work in order to the ſame end alſo; and therefore when it appears that men are to a conſiderable degree induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and earneſt for the advancing of Godlineſs, it is an indubitable ſign or Character that the Spirit of God is preſent, that he is there with a great preſence with an abundance of himſelf and of his power.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> Another ſign of perſons being filled with the Spirit of God is a like worthy degree of heavenly mindedneſs. When mens minds and thoughts are much intent upon, and taken up with heavenly things; when the daily converſe of the heart and ſoul is with things of another World; when a man can ſacrifice his greateſt earthly accommodations and conveniences upon his ſpiritual and heavenly intereſt; and when, notwithſtanding any ſtate of bleſſedneſs doth accrue unto us, as unto the things of this World, yet a mans heart is daily in heaven when by our Faith we can rent the Vail: I ſay, when the mind and thoughts of a man are much exerciſed and acted about theſe things, this is a great ſign likewiſe that there is much of the Spirit of God in him. The reaſon
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:95016:182"/>of this is, becauſe the Spirit of God came down from heaven on purpoſe to make men heavenly minded, and to negotiate the intereſt and affairs of his own Country, much after the manner of Agents and Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, who come to treat about the things of their own Country: So the Spirit doth come down from heaven; he is the great Prince that doth negotiate the affairs thereof with men, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. <hi>By them that have preached the Goſpel unto you with the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from heaven.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt is come to preach the Goſpel, and the effect he deſireth may be produced by it, is, that of earthly and carnal he might tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form perſons into heavenly and ſpiritual. Now in whomſoever this is carried on to any ſenſible and notable degree, inſomuch that it is percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by thoſe that have to do with them, that their minds are queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs much taken up, much ſet upon the things of the World which is to come, the things of heaven; and that in compariſon thereof the things of this World, and the concernments hereof are undervalued, and made to ſtand by when the other are in place; that theſe are made to give way when the intereſt of the other requires it; I ſay, when any man is diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by thoſe with whom he converſeth to be of ſuch a frame and temper of ſpirit as this is, it is a very promiſing ſign and Character that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is full of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If we ſow plentifully to the Spirit, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> this is another ſign of a good import, and very promiſing that men are filled with the Spirit. What it is to ſow to the Spirit we ſhewed you formerly, when we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed a ſowing unto the Spirit as a means whereby to be filled with the Spirit. To ſow to the Spirit we ſignified unto you was to live in ſuch waies, to perform ſuch Actions, and theſe frequently and conſtantly, which the Spirit may reap, <hi>i. e.</hi> from whence the Spirit of God may have acknowledgement, honour, and praiſe amongſt men in the world. In the ſame phraſe of ſpeech the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11.) calls the preaching of the Goſpel unto men, the ſowing of ſpiritual things unto them: <hi>If we have ſown unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great matter for us to reap your carnal things?</hi> The faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel are ſaid to ſow ſpiritual things unto men when they preach the Goſpel truly and effectually unto them; becauſe they may reap ſpiritual benefit and advantage from what they ſow, it being the proper tendency of thoſe things which they preach unto men to yield an encreaſe and harveſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature and excellency of the Seed. In like manner, men may be ſaid to ſow unto the Spirit of God when they walk in ſuch waies, and in the performance of ſuch Actions which are like to turn to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of praiſe, and glory, or contentment unto the Spirit of God: As on the contrary, when men and women go ſo to work, behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo unworthily in the World that the Spirit is like to ſuffer preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice or diſparagement by them, <hi>viz.</hi> when men ſhall be occaſioned or tempted to think or ſay that the Spirit of God never regarded, never
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:95016:183"/>looked graciouſly upon ſuch a perſon that walketh and acteth ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, ſo wickedly, in ſuch caſes as this men are ſaid to <hi>grieve the Spirit of God;</hi> they ſow the ſeeds of Gall and Wormwood unto him. If you ask me, What are theſe waies or actions more particularly by which men and women may be ſaid <hi>to ſow unto the Spirit?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I reply, They are ſuch which give teſtimony both of the preſence of the Spirit of God in them, and likewiſe of the goodneſs of this Spirit. Such as are waies of Righteouſneſs, Love, Humility, Patience, Mercy, Bounty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch waies and actions as theſe may therefore be ſaid to give teſtimony both of the preſence of the Spirit in men, and likewiſe of the goodneſs of this Spirit: becauſe, firſt, If he were not in men perſwading unto, aiding, and aſſiſting in ſuch waies and actions as theſe, they would never proceed from them, but on the contrary the Fleſh would prevail and bring forth fruits in its kind. Again ſecondly, If this Spirit were not a Spirit of Goodneſs he would not move and ſtir up men and women to ſuch good and worthy waies and actions as theſe, but to the contrary, as the unclean Spirit (Satan) ſtirreth up many in his kind. Now it is a worthy Teſtimony given to the Spirit, not only when men teſtifie or aſſert his goodneſs unto the World, but alſo when they aſſert his preſence with men, or in men; this argues the exceeding graciouſneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion of his nature.</p>
               <p>So then, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> they who abound in ſuch waies and works as theſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and walk with an high hand in them, are hereby plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be full of the Spirit of God: The reaſon hereof is, becauſe, as the loweſt proportion of the fruits we ſpeak of, and the leaſt, and leaſt conſiderable of them, do argue that men have ſome kind or degree of the Spirit in them; otherwiſe they would be wholly and totally bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in this kind: So doth it argue a worthy and excellent proportion of the Spirit in men, when they are full of ſuch fruits, eſpecially, when the fruits they bear in this kind are any thing more large or fair than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary. As when a fruit bearing tree, in one kind or other; as ſuppoſe a Fig-tree, or a Pear-tree, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> beareth any proportion, though never ſo ſmall, of the fruit that is proper to it; this argues that there is a lively ſap and moyſture in the Tree in ſome degree or other, but if this Tree ſhall be ſeen with boughs laden with Fruit, and that of the largeſt and goodlieſt that is to be found, this is a ſign not ſimply that the Tree hath ſap and moiſture in it: But that it is full of ſap, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks <hi>of the trees of the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 104.16. [<hi>i. e.</hi> according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Dialect, Trees that are excellently thriving and flouriſhing in their kind.] In like manner, when men and women ſhall ſow plentifully unto the Spirit (in the ſenſe declared;) eſpecially, if the Seed which they ſow in this kind ſhall be goodly, fair, and large, this is an unqueſtionable demonſtration that they are filled with the Spirit of God. When men and women ſhall quit themſelves above the ordinary rate of Profeſſours
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:95016:183"/>and Believers, in works of Love, Faith, Humility, and Self-denial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall truly, and without any tincture of ill will, or hard thoughts, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give and paſs by ſome great injury done unto them by men. If thou beeſt able to paſs by an eminent wrong, and if thou canſt upon the next opportunity, as the next day, or the like, kindly intreat him that hath done it; If thou canſt deal freely and lovingly with him, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury hath not at all weakened or enfeebled thine hand; now this doth argue a rich preſence of the Spirit of God, eſpecially in conjunction with the other things mentioned. And ſo again, when the fruits and expreſſions of their love to Jeſus Chriſt, or his Saints and Followers, ſhall be very large and fair, ſuch as ſhall be found in none but themſelves, and perhaps in here one, and there one beſides; as when either with the poor Widow in the Goſpel, they ſhall caſt in their whole ſubſtance or liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood into the Treaſury of God, or elſe ſhall ſacrifice ſome great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table opportunity of worldly advantage upon the Service of God, and of the People of God, eſpecially, if they ſhall do this once and again, and as often as any opportunity affords it ſelf unto them; this cannot but argue an excellent fulneſs of the Spirit of God. <hi>The Tree</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>is known by the Fruit,</hi> and this not only in reſpect of the kind or property of it (which is the knowledge ſpoken of by our Saviour:) But likewiſe in the degree of it; not only good in the kind, and of the ſame nature, but alſo the beſt of the kind for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> Another diſcovering Character of a perſons being filled with the Spirit of God is, when he is able and willing (they are both one in this caſe) to take up any Croſs, though never ſo heavy, that he ſhall meet withal in the way of Righteouſneſs, and of God, without any declining or turning aſide out of his way to avoid it: This is a great ſign and argument of conviction that certainly he is filled with the Spirit of God, eſpecially, when he ſhall ſuffer <hi>Patience to have its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work</hi> (as <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>i. e.</hi> ſhall be content chearfully, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out muttering or complaint, to ſuffer all that God ſhall call him to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, though the Iniquity of thoſe who perſecute (in one kind or other) abound never ſo much, yet he will not ſo much as ſtoop or ſtep out of the way for it; but ſhall keep ſtrait courſe in the waies of God in the view of the World; there cannot be a more promiſing ſign or ſymptome of a perſon being filled with the Spirit of God than this.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of this is, becauſe all kinds of ſufferings are contrary to the Fleſh, and deſtructive to the intereſt thereof; and unleſs it be to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the Fleſh at ſome other turn, and in ſome other way, no man that can decline them will expoſe himſelf unto them, but only ſuch who are ſtrengthened by the Spirit of God in the inward man. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in laying down the ſigns of his Apoſtleſhip, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12.
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:95016:184"/>preſents patience under trouble, a willingneſs to ſuffer all, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of afflictions for the Goſpels ſake: For one among the reſt. If a man have a proportionable aid and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, though he do put his ſhoulder under the burthen of affliction, yet being acted and aſſiſted by this Spirit, the Fleſh will not feel any bitterneſs or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in it, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. <hi>Strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all long ſuffering and patience with joyfulneſs.</hi> 1 Theſ. 3.3. <hi>That no man ſhould be moved by their afflictions.</hi> He acquaints them in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Verſe, that he had ſent <hi>Timothy</hi> unto them to confirm and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh them in the Faith, and in the things which they now had believed: And that for this end, that no man ſhould be moved by any of thoſe things which they ſuffered; <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>I ſent him unto you to hear of your faith, leſt that by any means you ſhould be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted;</hi> implying, that perſecution is a ſore kind of temptation: this is like the Axe that is laid to the root of the Tree. This he knew would put them to it, and be a means even to endanger the ſhaking of their Faith, and to tell the World that they did only make a ſhew of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, but were not eſtabliſhed in the truth. So again, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.3, 5, 6. <hi>Remembring without ceaſing your work of faith, and labour of love, and your patience of hope,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For our Goſpel came not unto you in word only, but alſo in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As ye know what manner of men we were among you for your ſake, having received the Word in much afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with joy of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now this is that I ſay, had they not had the Holy Ghoſt to ſtand by them, as they would never have received the Goſpel, ſo neither without a rich preſence of him would they ever have perſevered therein in a day of perſecution. This then is the reaſon of the Character or ſign in the eighth place.</p>
               <p>Ninthly (and laſtly) A fulneſs with the Spirit of God is diſcernable by a rich and inward acquaintance with the mind and will of God and of Jeſus Chriſt in the Scriptures: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> When a man or woman knows more, underſtands more of the mind of Chriſt in the Goſpel, hath more of things ſecret and hidden unto others diſcovered and made known unto them, this argues that the Spirit dwelleth plentifully in them; only there are two particulars to be conſidered and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That for men and women to pretend to a knowledge of the mind of God in the Scriptures above other perſons, and to be confident of their own apprehenſions and conceits in this kind is nothing, is no Argument or proof at all that therefore they do know the mind of Chriſt in the Scriptures, more or better than other men, or conſequently, that they are perſons filled with the Spirit of God: For all this may be, men and women may ſee the Viſions of their own hearts (as the Scripture ſpeaketh) and be as confident, as confidence it ſelf can make them, that they are Viſions of God, and verily think (as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſometimes
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:95016:184"/>did in like caſe) that they ſee the Viſions of God. The falſe Prophets of old, <hi>who walked in the Spirit of falſhood</hi> (or, as ſome read the words, <hi>in the wind of falſhood, Mic.</hi> 2.11.) Theſe were as confident of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as the Prophets of God could be: See an inſtance in <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the Son of <hi>Chenaanah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.11. He was ſo confident that he would needs make himſelf two Iron horns to puſh the <hi>Syrians</hi> withal until they were conſumed. <hi>Michaiah,</hi> the true Prophet of God, was not more confident of the Viſion which he had ſeen. And ſo the Phariſees in the Goſpel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.40. <hi>Are we blind alſo?</hi> As who ſhould ſay, If any men in all the World doth ſee, and know, and underſtand the mind of God, we do; we can well bear that thou ſhouldſt look upon the reſt of the World, the ordinary ſort of people, as blind, but we pray thee do not make us blind alſo; clearly implying, and that with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt indignation, that whatſoever he ſhould ſpeak that ſhould intimate in the leaſt that they ſhould not know the mind of God, that that muſt be moſt falſe. And in theſe daies, how many pretenders have we to little leſs than a Prophetick Unction, to myſtical diſcoveries, to a deep and further inſight into the mind of God in the Scriptures, and to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of things there; whoſe Notions (notwithſtanding the pretended fruits of ſuch their high Anointings and Revelations) being weighed in the Balance of the Sanctuary, are found light, and to have nothing of the mind of God or of Chriſt in them? Therefore (in the firſt place) unleſs theſe diſcoveries, which are pretended unto, and held forth with the greateſt confidence, ſhall commend themſelves for truth unto the judgments and underſtandings of ſober and judicious men, much verſed and exerciſed in the Scriptures, either from their own light or evidence, or elſe ſhall be made out by light of Argument and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, Whether from the Scriptures, or clear Principles in reaſon to be real truths, and ſuch things that are every waies worthy the Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs of God, they are not to be looked upon as proceeding from any fulneſs of the Spirit in their Authors, but as the exertions and puttings forth of a Spirit of vanity and deluſion in men: For certainly, God would not have ſent Chriſt Jeſus in the end of the World to ſeal vp Revelations and Propheſies, and to ſet bounds unto the Children of men, and afterward ſend theſe men to gather up what Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath ſcattered, and to make perfect what he hath left imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Wko knoweth not that the New Teſtament is ſealed with a Curſe, with dread and terrour unto the man or woman that ſhall either make any breach upon that which is there delivered by diminiſhing ought thereof, and ſo likewiſe unto any that ſhall bring any new or further Revelation, than what is already brought in there?</p>
               <p>Secondly, In caſe by the opportunity and advantage of Education, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> liberty for Study, and ſearching into Authors and Writers, or the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of pregnancy of Wit, quickneſs of Apprehenſions, or the like,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:95016:185"/>any man ſhall attain unto a greater dexterity or ability to unfold the Scriptures, and to bring many of the ſecrets thereof to light which have been hidden from the eyes of others; this doth not neceſſarily argue a fulneſs of, or a being filled with the Spirit (at leaſt in the ſenſe wherein we have proſecuted the Doctrine hitherto, <hi>i. e.</hi> a filling with the Spirit as ſanctifying) unleſs it ſhall appear by their lives and waies that they are really and throughly perſwaded of the truth and certainty of theſe things which they hold forth from the Scriptures. It is true, many men may do great Services for the Chriſtian World, and for the Saints, and that by opening the great Deeps or Fountains of the Scriptures, and may cauſe many beams of light and Spiritual underſtanding to break forth, and many waies of Wiſdom there to appear, and yet may not believe. As it is with a fained Story, though there may be ſome kind of rationality in it, yet the rationality of it doth not therefore argue its truth and verity; juſt ſo, men may maintain the reaſonableneſs of the Scriptures, and conſequently, many great truths therein contained; they may argue excellently, and ſhew how one thing giveth light unto another; and yet nevertheleſs at the bottom there may be nothing elſe but uncertainties and doubtings of the truth of all the Story; and this hollowneſs and defection at the bottom, and core, and root of the heart is like to break out and bewray it ſelf, in ſuch a kind of life and converſation, which is unſutable unto the tenour of Scripture, and unto the Genius, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and light of the glorious Goſpel which they declare or preach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon of the Character or ſign laſt mentioned, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>22</label> whereby to judge of any mans being filled with the Spirit is, becauſe it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work of the Spirit to open and reveal unto men the Scriptures, and the mind of God there; ſo that when any perſon, man or woman, ſhall be found to excell in ſuch a way, upon the terms, and with the cautions lately ſpecified (I mean) to be richly acquainted with the mind of God in the Scripture, it muſt needs argue a great meaſure of the Spirit of God in them. For it is (I ſay) the property of the Spirit of God to reveal the mind of God in the Scriptures, and to reveal ſuch and ſuch truths which have lain dormant in the bodies of the Scriptures, wound up and unpubliſhed: For the Spirit of God hath reſerved and ſet apart ſome particular portion of truth which is appropriate to every Age and Generation that cometh over the World, which is to be opened unto it. Some conceive that the ſeven Seals do reſpect ſeveral Ages and times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſeveral truths are to be revealed, as that in ſuch an Age and Time when one Seal was broken up, there was ſuch a part of the mind of God let out; and ſo at the breaking up of a ſecond, then cometh forth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the mind of God. This is clear, and experience teacheth us, that every Generation and every Age have had ſome ſealed or fallow ground of Scripture broken up unto them, ſome conſiderable paſſage of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:95016:185"/>Scripture that hath never ſeen the Sun, that hath never been ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally underſtood or known by men as in the preſent Generation; ſo that it being the proper work of the Spirit of God to take away the vail and covering which hath been upon the Scriptures, when he findeth ſome perſon whom he doth much delight in, he will ſingle him out for this ſervice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10, 11, &amp;c. <hi>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God:</hi> That is, according to Scripture Language, teacheth men to ſearch, and to find out by ſearching the deep things of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch Counſels of his which do not lie in the ſurface of the Scriptures; ſuch things which cannot be ſeen at the firſt caſt of a mans eye: <hi>For what man knoweth the things of a man ſave the ſpirit of a man which is in him? Even ſo, the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</hi> Now the Notions which are bred in the Mind and in the Nature of God, are of another ſort, of a quite different nature from thoſe which are ingendred and conceived in the mind of men; even as thoſe impreſſions in bruit beaſts are of a far other nature and kind from thoſe which are in men; and being of another nature and kind (and alſo inferiour to thoſe Notions or Impreſſions which are in man) they cannot underſtand or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend thoſe Notions, or Impreſſions, and thoſe Principles of Action that are in men, and by which they order and ſteere their courſe: The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe theſe Notions or Impreſſions that are in Men are of a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour kind to thoſe in Beaſts, and out of the reach of them, or any other created being (eſpecially) beneath themſelves: So that though it ſhould be ſuppoſed, that the Creature man, by reaſon of the excellency of his Nature above other Creatures, were able perfectly to underſtand thoſe ſeveral Impreſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are in their beings reſpectively; yet could they never comprehend thoſe in man, for the reaſon even now hinted: In like manner, though God be able to comprehend all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Principles, and all the Projections that are incident to the hearts and ſpirits of men; yet men are not able, without the Spirit to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend and conceive what his Thoughts, Notions, Counſels, and Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are. <hi>But now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God;</hi> otherwiſe, without this Spirit, no man knoweth what are the things of God, and thoughts of his heart, no more than any other Creature knoweth, or is able to comprehend what is in the hearts of men. So again, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Now we have received not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given unto us of God:</hi> Meaning, the things of the Goſpel, thoſe terms and conditions upon which life and ſalvation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and ſecured unto the World. This ſheweth, that where there is any conſiderable degree of the knowledge of the things of God, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the deep things of God, that have been kept ſecret from Age to Age. This argueth an excellent preſence of the Spirit of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:95016:186"/>
                  <hi>Which things we alſo ſpeak, not in the words which mans wiſdom tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the natural man receiveth not the things of God,</hi> &amp;c. By the natural man in this place is not meant the unregenerate, or the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal man, but the Babe in Chriſt. <hi>I could not ſpeak unto you</hi> (ſaith that Apoſtle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. of the ſame Epiſtle) <hi>as unto ſpiritual, but as unto carnal, even babes in Chriſt.</hi> So that evident it is from this Scripture, that theſe natural men, who could not receive the things of God, were not unregenerate men, or carnal in the ſenſe which we generally take the word carnal, but babes in Chriſt. Now theſe could not underſtand any thing but what was plain; the things here ſpoken of, the deep things of God, ſuch things which lie above the apprehenſions of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary men, theſe things are too ſtrong for ſuch mens ſtomacks, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear them, they cannot ſee how they ſhould be agreeable to the Goodneſs, Wiſdom, and Love of God, neither can they receive them, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt they are Babes, or Children: Yea, though in their ſtate of Childhood they are not capable of them, they are capable of growing and coming to manhood. A man that hath not had to do with Jewels, he knows them not, nor of what value or worth they are: Even ſo it is with the deep and excellent things of the Goſpel, if theſe be ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe that are weak in judgment, and Children in underſtanding; alas! they know not what to make of them; they can make no nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment of them: but in time they may grow to ſuch a capacity, that ſuch meat as this will be the moſt deſirable unto them, and they will ſay as the Jews, <hi>Lord, evermore give us this bread.</hi> Men that are grown will call for ſtrong meat, ſuch as will ſort and ſute with their ſtomacks. And thus much for this Character: And ſo we have done with our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the third (and laſt) of the three Queſtions long ſince propounded for the further clearing and opening of the Doctrine; we are now come to the Uſe and Application. This Doctrine is uſeful three ſeveral waies: For Inſtruction, for Reproof, and for Exhortation.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> The firſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Doctrine, by way of Inſtruction, in four main Points; Firſt, Shewing how comely a thing it is for men and women to be found obedient to the Commands of God in general; and particularly, how beautiful and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a thhing it is for men and women to be filled with the Spirit of God, and to be found acting accordingly. Secondly, An account given what ſtrangers the Saints themſelves are unto many great Duties, and more eſpecially unto this great Duty of being filled with the Spirit, inſomuch that even this Generation are (as it were) aſleep thereunto. Thirdly, That this great bleſſedneſs of being filled with the Spirit is no impoſſible thing, but is attainable by the endeavours and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of men. Fourthly, and laſtly, That it is the will and deſign of God that Believers ſhould be a Royal Generation of Kings and Prieſts unto himſelf, and that they ſhould live accordingly.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, For Inſtruction; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> if it be a Duty impoſed by God upon all men, and more eſpecially upon all Believers, to be filled with the Spirit; then take we knowledge from hence, That it is a comely and honourable thing for men and women to <hi>be filled with the Spirit,</hi> and to act and declare themſelves accordingly; I mean, ſo to behave and demean themſelves in all things, that it may be known to the World that they are filled with the Spirit: their Actions and Waies ſhould be all Heroick and Princelike, and have a luſtre, and beauty, and brightneſs in them above the Actions, Waies, and Converſations of other men. Even as the Lord Chriſt was known to be the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God (<hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14.) by that excellent glory wherein he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; <hi>We ſaw</hi> (ſaith the Evangeliſt) <hi>his glory as the glory of the only begotten Son of God;</hi> meaning, that his glory, whatſoever it was, was ſo glorious, and ſo excellent for the kind of it, that they that ſaw it could not but conceive and judge that it was too full and too Majeſtick for any Creature whatſoever; too excellent for any of the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and much more for man; and by this they perceived him to be the only begotten of God; thoſe Robes of glory were too rich for any Creature to be attired and adorned withal, though they did (indeed) become the glory and dignity of his Perſon: In like manner, it would
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:95016:187"/>be exceeding comely for the Sons and Daughters of God to have ſuch a glory of life and converſation ſtill to accompany them as they walk up and down the World, and where-ever they become, which may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them from all others to be perſons of that rank, and ſuch a Generation that are filled with the Spirit of God. My Brethren, there is a ſtrain of Action and Converſation that is apt and able to convince the World even againſt their minds and wills, and will make them confeſs and acknowledge that theſe are a Generation of men and women by themſelves; for God enjoyns nothing by any of his Precepts or Laws unto men but what is comely, grateful, and lovely for them to do, and that which will commend them both in his eyes, and in the eyes of all his Angels, yea, of all truly judicious and underſtanding men. Even as Parents are wont to teach their Children a good carriage of themſelves, and comlineſs of behaviour that may render them acceptable on all hands: So doth God by his Precepts and Exhortations teach the Sons and Daughters of men ſuch a deportment and demeanour of themſelves in all caſes, and under all circumſtances that will ſet them off with the beſt and higheſt acceptation with men; for every Command and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of his hath a kind of pleaſant correſpondence with the frame and condition of man: and when men and women neglect the performance of any of them in their ſeaſon, or ſhall do any thing contrary unto them, they render themſelves ſo much the leſs lovely and deſirable. No man ever neglected any of the Commands of God, but that by every ſuch neglect, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> they ſtain and ſpot the dignity and excellency of their glory; whereas if they had been true to themſelves, and to their own intereſt, in yielding obedience to thoſe Commands of God, they would have been more lovely, comely, and pleaſant, and more highly accepted both with God and amongſt men. The Holy Ghoſt himſelf very frequently commends obedience and ſubjection unto the Laws of God under this very Notion we now ſpeak of unto men. <hi>My Son</hi> (ſaith <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> Prov. 1.8, 9.) <hi>hear the Inſtruction of thy Father, and forſake not the Law of thy Mother: For they ſhall be an Ornament of grace upon thy head, and Chains upon thy neck;</hi> meaning, that Inſtructions from the Word of God, adminiſtred unto us by our Parents, and thoſe that be over us, being regarded and ſubmitted unto by us, will render us lovely, and reſpected both of God and men. So again, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.22. <hi>So ſhall ſhe</hi> (meaning, Wiſdom ſubmitted unto) <hi>be life unto thy ſoul, and grace unto thy neck. She ſhall be an Ornament of Grace unto thy head,</hi> &amp;c. So again, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9, 10. The Apoſtle in this Contexture of Scripture ſheweth how women, profeſſing Godlineſs, ought to behave themſelves in all Modeſty, Shamefac'dneſs, and Sobriety, accompanied with good works; theſe (namely, good works) are comely Ornaments as well for men as for women. And it is the property of good works, and all manner of conforming to the Will of God to make a kind of noiſe in
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:95016:187"/>the World, and to provoke men to look upon them who are found, fruitful in them: Even as rich Jewels do make and beget by their Luſtre a kind of high eſteem and reverence in men to perſons who wear them: In like manner, they who ſhall adorn themſelves with works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, by ſubmitting to the Commands of God, ſhall by ſuch waies be known to be the Sons of God; even by the richneſs of thoſe Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Jewels which hang about their necks. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.15. <hi>It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh us</hi> (ſaith our Lord Chriſt) <hi>to fulfill all Righteouſneſs;</hi> as who ſhould ſay, This is the way that would advance and adorn him, and make him more comely in the ſight of God his Father, and of Angels, and of Men. And ſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.2. <hi>That ye receive her in the Lord</hi> (ſpeaking of <hi>Phebe</hi>) <hi>as becometh Saints, and that ye aſſiſt her,</hi> &amp;c. My Brethren, there is no occaſion, no buſineſs, nothing to be done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abroad, or at home, when a man is ſitting in his houſe, or ſpeaking to his Servants, or any other perſons, but there is an opportunity for ſuch a kind of behaviour which will well become us, and which will ſet us off with a kind of comlineſs or lovelineſs in the eyes of thoſe which are about us. This then is the firſt thing which we commend unto you by way of Inſtruction; That if it be a Duty impoſed by God upon all men, eſpecially Believers, to be filled with the Spirit, then is it a comly and honourable thing for men and women to be filled with the Spirit, and to walk accordingly, by means whereof they ſhall find acceptation both in Heaven and in Earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> If it be the Will and Command of God that all Believers (eſpecially) ſhould be filled with the Spirit of God, take we further knowledge from hence, that there are ſome Duties, and theſe of moſt worthy conſequence and concernment unto men, unto which the minds and conſciences of men, even of Profeſſours themſelves, are generally aſleep, taking little notice of them, or of yielding obedience unto them; they do not put them into their Roll or Catalogue of Duties, or things commanded or enjoyned.</p>
               <p>For firſt, That this Precept of God which enjoyns a being filled with the Spirit of God, directed more particularly unto the Saints, is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of very high concernment unto them hath been made to appear formerly, and particularly when we gave directions how to raiſe an ardent deſire in your ſouls unto it, by ſetting before you the various and moſt rich accommodations which do alwaies accompany ſuch a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That this Precept, notwithſtanding the excellency of it, is little in the thoughts of Believers themſelves, and that their Conſciences are little better than dead unto it, is too too evident from the general neglect that is found amongſt them of the uſe of the means which are proper to fill them accordingly, without the diligent uſe whereof it is impoſſible they ſhould be obedient unto the Precept (as we have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:95016:188"/>opened the buſineſs unto you;) and beſides, the little regard of this Precept, even amongſt Believers themſelves, is apparent more than enough from the general tenour of their actions and waies, which are nothing like the actions and waies of men filled with the Spirit. And as it is with this Precept of being filled with the Spirit in being ſo generally neglected and forgotten by Believers; So is it with ſeveral other alſo, which ſhare in the ſame diſreſpect at the hand of Believers with it, <hi>viz.</hi> as That of walking circumſpectly [or exactly, as the word ſignifies] That of redeeming the time in reſpect of the evil of the daies wherein we live: That of bearing one anothers burthens: That of not reſpecting perſons for their wealth and coſtly cloaths: That which enjoyns rich men to be rich in good works: Theſe with ſome others; as generally all ſuch which grate hard upon the fleſh, and require a ſpiritual Heroick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true greatneſs of ſpirit to ſubmit unto them, and which are not ſanctioned or back'd with an expreſs threatning of excluſion from the Kingdom of God, and of Salvation, in caſe of diſobedience. Moſt of the Precepts of any of theſe Characters are like ſome abſolute and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Laws or Statutes in a State or Commonwealth, which through a long, cuſtomary, and general diſuſe and neglect are no more minded or regarded than if they were not; nor perſons any waies challenged, charged, or thought the worſe of for not conforming themſelves unto them: So are ſuch Precepts of Chriſtianity, which reſpect excellency of walking, and have not the vengeance of hell fire attending them to awaken the Conſciences of men to the obſervance. They ſeem to be no otherwiſe looked upon by Profeſſours than as if they were given by the Lord Chriſt only to be gazed on, and looked at; and not with any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they ſhould be obeyed by men, or with any expectation that they ſhould ſubmit unto them. The Reaſon hereof hath been lately intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (in part) <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they have not a ſanction like that of the Law given upon Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> they are not given or enjoyned with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Earthquakes, or Fire, but as with a ſtill voice. And the Children of God themſelves (as we lately had occaſion to obſerve) having much ſervility of Spirit hanging on them, and ſo being more intent and taken up in their thoughts about eſcaping hell and damnation, and not ſo much upon obtaining Heaven and Salvation, but only in a collateral and and conſequential way: hence it cometh to paſs, that they chiefly and mainly ſet their hearts and minds upon ſuch Precepts, the diſobedience and neglect whereof is threatned with the vengeance of Hell fire, or with excluſion of the Kingdom of Heaven; and think that thoſe which have not this Iron Rod in their hand to over-aw the Conſciences of men into obedience unto them are leſs conſiderable.</p>
               <p>For this is much to be minded (which I do not remember that I have had occaſion heretofore to offer unto you) <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> That God hath built and framed the body of his Laws and Precepts given unto men upon the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:95016:188"/>like terms, by ſuch Principles and Rules of Wiſdom and Equity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto which, prudent Law-makers amongſt men are wont to compile and frame the body of thoſe Civil or Politick Laws which they make for the benefit or uſe of their States or Communities reſpectively; and very probably (nay, the thing is very little, or not at all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable) God hath imprinted that Principle of Reaſon and Equity we now ſpeak of in the hearts of men in conformity to the Original Copy in himſelf. Now it is generally found in the Syſteme of all Politick Laws and Conſtitutions, that though there be rewards in ſeveral kinds and degrees aſſigned and decreed by Law unto perſons that ſhall do any eminent or worthy ſervice unto their State or Country; yet there is no penalty or puniſhment enacted againſt thoſe who ſhall not quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thus worthily, and honourably for the benefit of this ſtate: Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws and Statutes are not made for thoſe, or againſt thoſe that are not eminently vertuous, eminently valiant, liberal, bountiful, wiſe, or the like: But only againſt thoſe who are eminently vicious; and ſhall act to the detriment, prejudice, or hurt of the Community of which they are Members. Thus the <hi>Romans</hi> had Laws for the rewarding of the high Services of their Souldiers; he that firſt ſealed the Walls of a City or Town beſieged had his <hi>Corona muralis, i.e.</hi> A certain Garland or Crown, which was a Badge of honour appropriate to that Service; ſo he that firſt entred the Trenches of the Enemies had his <hi>Corona vallaris;</hi> ſo he that preſerved the life of any Citizen or free Denizon of <hi>Rome</hi> had his <hi>Corona civica;</hi> But they had no Laws that inflicted any puniſhment upon thoſe that did not perform thoſe Services, or had not valour or courage ſufficient to atchieve them. Anciently in our own Land there was by Law a reward appointed unto him that ſhould kill a Wolf and bring forth his head. So, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 15.16. <hi>Caleb</hi> made a Law or Decree, that he that ſhall ſmite <hi>Kiriath-Sephar</hi> and take it ſhould have his Daughter to Wife. Now as the <hi>Romans</hi> did not enact any penalty to be inflicted upon any that did not attain any of thoſe excellent Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; neither did the Law in this Land inflict any puniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe who could not kill a Wolf: In like manner, God hath ſo contrived and tempered the frame and Syſteme of his Laws in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which are made for the orderly regulation and benefit of the great Community, or Body Politick of the World, that though there be rewards and encouragements Enacted and Decreed in them, for thoſe that ſhall excel in vertue, and quit themſelves above the ordinary rate of men, either for the honour and glory of God, or for the publick benefit or ſervice of men, yet there is no threatning of puniſhment, in one kind or other, againſt thoſe who ſhall not attain to that excellent ſtrain above their Fellows; unleſs (haply) it be that they ſhall not partake in the ſignal reward of the other, which (to ſpeak properly) is no puniſhment: But the threatnings in the Law of God are bent againſt
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:95016:189"/>thoſe who ſhall be wicked, that ſhall live and act to the diſhonour of his name, or to the damage, prejudice, or trouble of the Community of men amongſt whom they ſhould have their being. We ſhall ſee in the courſe of the Scriptures how the threatnings of God lie againſt that kind of ſin or ſinners that are directly ſet and bent againſt the holy and righteous Law of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5, 6. <hi>For this ye know, that no Whoremonger, nor Covetous man who is an Idolater,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words,</hi> &amp;c. and compare <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8, 27. <hi>But the Fearful; and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving, and Sorcerers, and Idolaters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall have their portion in the Lake,</hi> &amp;c. As Civil Conſtitutions, and Politick Laws of men do provide for the peace, ſafety, and comfort of thoſe that ſhall live in ſubjection to them, prohibiting and puniſhing all waies and actions that are prejudicial and hurtful to the publick, yet not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting or inflicting any puniſhment on thoſe that do no rare or excellent ſervice, as though they be not eminent defenders of the State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In like manner, God by his Laws hath provided for the ſafety, for the Eternal Salvation of thoſe that ſhall live in ſubjection unto ſuch Laws and Commands of his, by which men are reſtrained from waies and actions ſignally diſhonourable unto him, or diſturbing and miſchievous to thoſe amongſt whom they live and converſe, although they do not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto the eminent Services of <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> nor deſerve to be numbred amongſt the Worthies of the Chriſtian World; yet for thoſe who ſhall riſe up to the Line of thoſe famous men we ſpeak of, and ſerve God and men at ſuch a worthy rate as they ſerved them in their Generation, he hath in his Law provided better and greater things than ſimply ſafety and ſalvation, <hi>viz.</hi> ſalvation with an Emphaſis or Superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive weight of glory.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe (I conceive) the two Parables of our Saviour (both recorded by <hi>Luke,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> the one in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.36, 37. the other in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.7, 8, &amp;c.) are very conſiderable: The former of theſe, <hi>And ye your ſelves, like men that wait for their Lord when he will return from the Wedding, that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately; bleſſed are thoſe Servants whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall find watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Verily I ſay unto you, that he ſhall gird himſelf, and make them to ſit down to meat, and will come forth and ſerve them.</hi> Compare this Parable with that <hi>Luke</hi> 17.7.8. <hi>Which of you, having a Servant plowing or feeding Cattel, will ſay to him by and by, when he is came from the Field, go and ſit down to meat, and will not rather ſay unto him, make ready wherewith I may ſup, and gird thy ſelf and ſerve me till I have eaten and drunken, and afterwards thou ſhalt eat and drink. Doth he thank that Servant becauſe he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</hi> So likewiſe, <hi>Ye when ye ſhall have done all thoſe things which are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, ſay, we are unprofitable Servants.</hi> Now compare that which was
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:95016:189"/>delivered and taught in the former Parable (how the Lord Chriſt will gird himſelf and come forth and ſerve them) with that which is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed here, namely, that when they had girded themſelves, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto him (the Maſter) while he ſhall eat and drink, then they ſhall ſit down and eat and drink. And withal, Doth he thank ſuch a Servant becauſe he hath done thus? I trow not (ſaith he:) I ſuppoſe his meaning is, that it is not the manner of men, when Servants do but that which commanded them to do, the Maſter doth not think himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to them, neither doth he thank them by the beſtowing any ſignal or particular reward upon them. But now there is a kind of Servant upon whom the Maſter doth intend to beſtow very great and worthy things: For it is ſaid in the other Parable expreſly, he will gird himſelf, and come forth and ſerve them; He will do it in the ſight of Heaven and Earth; all the World ſhall take notice that he will account thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, there ſpoken of, worthy of double honour, he himſelf will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them. But if the Queſtion be, But what is it that maketh the difference between theſe two kinds of ſervices, in point of Reward, both of them were good Servants and typifies ſuch perſons who ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved? The buſineſs is this, if you will but conſider the nature of theſe Commands, you will find a difference of theſe Servants; They that do the things in the latter Parable which are commanded them; that is, which are properly, and poſitively, and ſtrictly commanded them, <hi>viz.</hi> when God ſhall pitch determinately, that either they muſt do them, or elſe ſuffer for it, and be deſtroyed with the vengeance of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fire. Now, they that go forth in their obedience in this kind, ſo far as that they may eſcape theſe dangers, they ſhall ſit down when their Lord and Maſter hath eat and drank, that is, they ſhall receive the common reward of Salvation. But there are another kind of Servants (in another conſideration very proper and paſſable too) that ſerve not as Servants, but rather as Sons; namely, thoſe that ſhall ſet themſelves, and ſtir up their hearts to obedience unto God in theſe high Commands of his, which are not things commanded after ſuch a manner, or with ſuch a kind of Command as was mentioned formerly, with threatnings of hell fire unto thoſe who ſhall diſobey them: They who ſhall perform theſe high ſervices and commands of his, which are calculated on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for the ſpirits of thoſe men who are Children, who are of a filial ſpirit, and ingenuous temper, and who deſire to communicate in the greateſt and higheſt of the affairs and bleſſings of God; they who ſhall not content themſelves with the obſervation of the former kind of Laws, but ſhall riſe up in their obedience to the obſervation of the other, theſe are they whom their great Lord and Maſter Jeſus will <hi>gird himſelf, and come forth and ſerve them:</hi> That is, will ſhew them ſignal and ſpecial grace and favour by themſelves. But that by the way. The truth is, that the performance of the latter kind of ſervices, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that be
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:95016:190"/>not drawn out by the means of threatning of damnation, are of the moſt noble and genuine kind, and of higheſt acceptation with God, yet notwithſtanding there is no Law made againſt ſuch perſons who ſhall not be holy and exact, as <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job;</hi> that ſhall not be as worthy, excellent, and heavenly as theſe were, or as ſerviceable in their Generation; but yet theſe are they whom their Lord and Maſter will gird himſelf and come forth and ſerve, but will not do ſo by the other: So that the Servants or Believers, which are expreſſed in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſhall eat and drink when their Lord and Maſter hath eaten and drank, are theſe, who do only the things which are expreſly and particularly enjoyned, and that upon ſuch terms, that except they do them they ſhall neither eat nor drink: That is, they ſhall never be ſaved. And theſe (compared with the others) may well be termed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Servants, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.30. or rather, as the word ſignifieth (and ſo is tranſlated, <hi>ver.</hi> 26.) ſlothful or undiligent Servants; Servants that will do no more, nor ſtir one Inch beyond their preſcribed task. Now ſuch kind of Servants the Holy Ghoſt calls idle or ſluggiſh, who will not beſtir themſelves in their Maſters buſineſs as they ought to do. This is that which I was ſaying unto you, that it is the obſervation of this latter kind of Commands which are not threatned with deſtruction; this is that which doth beget in men that Child-like Spirit, and that confidence and boldneſs towards God; whereas the obſervation of that inferiour kind of Commands doth riſe no higher than deliverance from deſtruction, but doth not advance them to uſe it to any ſpecial intereſt in the favour and love of God; it riſeth no higher, nor begetteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in them, but a kind of fear, or ſervile ſpirit, full of doubts, and diffidence, and diſtruſtfulneſs; and theſe are the proper and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent effects of the obedience unto theſe two kinds of Commands. To clear this a little further; there are Inſtances in the Scriptures where we may obſerve both the one and the other, and likewiſe the mind and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of God in them. Such Precepts without conformity unto which, men cannot be ſaved, either they are ſuch which the Law of Nature doth impoſe upon men, and condemn and judge them if they break and tranſgreſs them; or elſe they are ſuch Commands, which by reaſon of ſome circumſtances of time and place, and ſome neceſſity, do ſo bear upon the Conſciences of men, that a man cannot neglect them without a manifeſt contempt of the Divine Authority and Majeſty of God; As for example, when God ſpake to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and commanded him to go out of his own Country; and ſo to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to go to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> or to <hi>Paul,</hi> to go to preach the Goſpel; now diſobedience in this kind would argue a great affront to the Majeſty of God: But there are other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands (though perperly enough Commands) wherein men are much left at liberty and freedom, <hi>viz.</hi> after what manner, and with what hearts and affections they do perform theſe; when men ſhall not only
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:95016:190"/>do ſimply and barely the thing that is expreſly commanded, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhall give out their hearts to it, and ſhall obſerve this after the beſt manner. This is that kind of ſervice which ſhall receive grace and thanks from the hands of God; For God eſtimateth the works of men much after the manner that men do the ſervices of their Children: if they perform ſuch ſervices after the manner of Sons, not as if they were a burthen unto them, they ſhall not ſimply have the reward of a Servant, but they ſhall have a further reward, the reward of a Son. The Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. implieth, that Chriſt did thank ſuch a Servant; Why? Becauſe, though in a ſimple conſideration, he did not act above what he was commanded; yet he did more, and above what he was commanded upon the penalty of Damnation. We read (<hi>Luke</hi> 17.12.) of Ten Lepers that were cleanſed, and we know that there was an expreſs Injunction in the Law, that when they were healed they ſhould ſhew themſelves to the Prieſt; and probable it is that all the Ten did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law in this caſe; only here is mention of one that did return and give the Lord Chriſt thanks. Now, though this perſon did no more, in that Act of Thankſgiving, than was a duty lying upon him in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial conſideration to do; and though the Nine did fulfill the Letter of the Law, and ſo did that whereby they might eſcape puniſhment, yet they did not riſe up to that grace and acceptation which the other perſon did; who did not only go to the High Prieſt, but returned and gave thanks to his Phyſician alſo, and did hereby obtain favour, and high acceptation from the hands of God and Jeſus Chriſt; upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſuch a behaviour he was as a Son, of a Son-like and ingenuous frame of heart.</p>
               <p>Conſider that paſſage of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.16. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> 
                  <hi>For though I preach the Goſpel, I have nothing to glory of: For a neceſſity is laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and woe is me if I preach not the Goſpel. For though I preach the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. Meaning, that this is nothing by way of ſpecial acceptation at the hands of God, becauſe he had a neceſſity lying upon him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Command of God, yea, under the Penalty of a Woe, <hi>Woe is unto me,</hi> &amp;c. But if I preach the Goſpel willingly, and with freeneſs of heart and ſoul, ſo, as if there were no expreſs and particular Law lying upon me to neceſſitate me thereunto, then I have ſomewhat to boaſt of; for this Service I know my Lord and Maſter will give me a peculiarity of reward. The Apoſtle in this place clearly diſtinguiſheth the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, when neceſſitated thereunto by a Command of God, from the preaching of it willingly. If I preach the Goſpel I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereof to boaſt, for a neceſſity is laid upon me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A man that hath nothing to engage him to an Action or Service but meerly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from puniſhment hath nothing to boaſt of: <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if I do this thing willingly I have my reward,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore to preach the Goſpel, and to preach it willingly, are two different Services; by doing
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:95016:191"/>the one, a man ſhall eſcape puniſhment, it being obedience to a neceſſity lying upon him: But if I preach it willingly, then (ſaith he) I know I ſhall have conſideration in abundance from the hand of my great Lord and Maſter. It follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>What is my reward then?</hi> The word is taken two waies, ſometimes more largely, ſometimes more ſtrictly; It is ſometimes tranſlated Wages, ſometimes Reward, or that conſideration which doth preciſely anſwer in value to the work which is done, and for which it is given. But ſometimes a reward, as when it exceeds in value the work done, and doth in a tranſcendent degree riſe above the ſtrict worthineſs of the Service; ſo then, <hi>What is my reward?</hi> That is, How muſt I go to work in this great Commiſſion which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto me to preach the Goſpel to make my ſelf capable of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? Why, (thus ſaith he) when I preach the Goſpel, that I make it without charge: This noble, excellent, and worthy ſtrain of the Apoſtle in performing the Service which was committed to him; this was the ground-work of his rejoycing, and that which filled him with ſo much confidence and boldneſs in the preſence of God; and this you will all find, if you will but ſtir up your hearts, and be ingenuous and noble towards God, and not ſtand picking and huckſtering with your hearts to know how you muſt do to eſcape hell fire; under ſuch a frame of heart you ſhall ſtill be full of fears and doubtings, you will not be like thoſe that are genuine, and noble, and high ſpirited in the Service of God. My Brethren, we ſhall all find, if we ſtir up our hearts, and ſtrengthen our hands to thoſe excellent Commands which are apt when they are obeyed to enoble our Spirits, the obedience unto them is that which will give us confidence and boldneſs before God: When as your obedience to the other will poſſibly give you ſome kind of faint hope that you ſhall be ſaved, and that you ſhall eſcape the wrath and vengeance that is to come, but will hardly carry you up further; but that your confidence will ever and anon be full of ſtands, and your Enemy the Devil will be ready to triumph over you: Whereas thoſe that have given up themſelves to obey their heavenly Father in thoſe great Commands, theſe are the men who are likely to have the Spirit of Adoption, to be able to come with boldneſs unto God, and to call God Father with a good courage.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> For Inſtruction; If it be the Will of God that all men, eſpecially Believers, ſhould be filled with the Spirit of God; then take knowledge from hence, that a being filled with the Spirit is no impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attainment, is an eſtate of happineſs which is acceſſible to the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and engagements of men; why elſe ſhould God call men unto it, or impoſe it as a duty upon them? Doth he invite or exhort the Saints to impoſſibilities? thoſe whom he deſireth to put beauty and excellency upon, doth he invite theſe to do things abſolutely, and altogether out of their reach? Doth he perſwade men to purchaſe the wind, or to lay
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:95016:191"/>out themſelves for that which can never be had, or enjoyed? Surely, he doth not, becauſe it is not a thing that doth any waies anſwer the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite grace and wiſdom of God. Some men indeed ſtrive to perſwade themſelves, and others, that God commandeth many things which he intendeth not that any man ſhould perform; yea, and which he knoweth are impoſſible for any man to perform: But I truſt none of us know theſe depths of <hi>Satan;</hi> I mean, are ſpiritually adulterous with them in our minds or thoughts, or practically know them. To be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to think that God intends not, deſires not our obedience unto whatſoever he demands of us, what is it but to break the very heart, and to cut in ſunder the very ſinews of our obedience, and weaken the hand of our preparations that way, and to tempt our ſelves to a neglect of the Commandments of God; yea, and to diſhearten, and diſcourage men from ſo much as the knowledge of what is commanded them of God? For if they ſhall know their Maſters Will, and yet not do it (and do it they cannot, if the intention of God ſtand in oppoſition hereunto, or if they want ability to do it:) I ſay, to know the Will of God, and not to do it, is to incur the danger of being beaten with many ſtripes, and to bring the ſorer condemnation upon themſelves: Therefore we need not demur upon this Point, or doubt, but that whatſoever God hath commanded us to do; yea, or ſhall exhort us unto, he hath put us into a capacity of doing it, at leaſt, into a mediate or remote capacity from which we may thorough the grace of God, that is never wanting unto us in this kind, advance unto that which is immediate, and within reach of the duty or performance it ſelf. Let us therefore comfort our ſelves over this gracious Advice and Exhortation given unto us by God <hi>of being filled with the Spirit;</hi> and know, that though it be an Eſtate or Priviledge very high and glorious (as we have declared formerly) yet it lieth within the reach of our faithful and zealous endeavours for the obtaining it; there is nothing that can hinder us from the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it but our voluntary neglect, and our ſlothfulneſs; which as it is the impoveriſhing and beggaring many thouſand in the World in reſpect of outward things; ſo is it univerſally the ſpiritual beggary and poverty of Chriſtians. There is no man ſuffers the want of any thing for his peace, and for the accommodation of his ſoul but his own ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and his own careleſneſs in this kind is acceſſary unto, and the occaſion of it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) for Inſtruction; If the Doctrine be true, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> take we notice from hence yet further, that it is the Will and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of God we ſhould be excellent, that we ſhould be a Royal Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood (indeed) unto him; that we ſhould live the life of Angels, both in point of HOlineſs and of Happineſs. For ſuch a life as this in both theſe high accommodations is comprehended in a being <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> (as we have formerly at large made known unto you when we ſet
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:95016:192"/>before you the tranſcendent Priviledges and great glory of ſuch a ſtate or accompliſhment:) How rich and bleſſed a Contemplation is it to feed upon, and to nouriſh our hearts withal, that God would not have us live at any low, under, or pedling rate, as not of Action, Service, or Employment, ſo neither of Contentment, Joy, or Satisfaction? But his mind and deſire is, to make us to live like Princes for the greatneſs and nobleneſs of our Imployments on the one hand; and like Princes alſo, for the deſirableneſs of our ſtate and condition on the other hand. It is ſaid of Chirſt, that he hath <hi>made us Kings and Prieſts unto God and his Father,</hi> Rev. 1.6. Firſt, Kings, then Prieſts; Kings in order to their Prieſthood; for the truth is, there is none fit or meet to be Prieſts unto God but thoſe that are Kings, <hi>i.e.</hi> that enjoy themſelves upon the richeſt and higheſt terms of contentment and joy that may be. Thoſe that miniſter unto him in his holy things, do not anſwer the nature and dignity of the Service, or of the things about which, and wherein they miniſter, but eſpecially they do not anſwer the infinite goodneſs and bounty of him whom they ſerve, who miniſter unto him either with dejected and ſad hearts and ſpirits on the one hand; or with remiſs or indifferent hearts on the other hand. Prieſts of a right Conſecration had need partake of the anointing of the great High Prieſt himſelf; I mean, they had need be anointed with the oyl of joy and gladneſs above their Fellows, above other men. Now, that the Heart of God is with the Sons and Daughters of men, to put them into the honourable capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city we ſpeak of, as far as is meet for him to promote the thing, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears (as hath been ſaid) by that moſt gracious advice he gives them, in requiring them to be filled with the Spirit: This is that which will make them Kings indeed, and Prieſts indeed. He that is filled with the Spirit is fit to ſtand before the God of all the Earth, and to miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; ſo that if any perſon be not a King, and ſo in the fulleſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of being a Prieſt unto God, the reaſon of his defectiveneſs in this kind is not God: The reaſon why he is not a King or Prieſt of this Royal Conſecration, is not becauſe God would not have him to be ſuch, or becauſe he is unwilling to confer ſuch things upon him, ſuch an anointing which would make him a Prieſt of this Conſecration. We ſee that God would have us all filled with the Spirit, which (being interpreted as we have heard) is to make us a Royal or Kingly Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: But the reaſon of every mans defectiveneſs or falling ſhort in this kind is his own Oſcitancy, willing negligence, and unworthineſs of ſpirit. We cannot ſay as <hi>Balak</hi> the King ſaid unto <hi>Balaam</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Num.</hi> 24.11. <hi>Now the Lord hath kept the back from honour;</hi> No, it is not the Lord who hath kept us from this honour, but we our ſelves; He is ſo far from keeping us from it, that he calls upon us, and counſels us, and tells us what we have to do in order to the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. And as I ſaid before, it is not meet for him to go on any
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:95016:192"/>farther in this work, his Spirit is free unto it, his Spirit is near unto you, it would fill your heart and ſoul, it would make you all Princes, and make you all a Royal Prieſthood unto God; but it is not meet for God to force ſuch a thing as this upon you, to make you do it whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will or no, to make you Kings and Priets whether you will or no: But now, that you might do this, he delivers out himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and he expecteth that there ſhould be a conſent on both hands; though otherwiſe there is as much importunity and force to encline and carry you that way as can be in a way of Argument; yea, and as much force, in reſpect of ſecret Impulſe and Excitation by the Spirit of God, as may be, only reſerving unto you the Liberty of conſenting unto it. So that this is another Inſtruction of rich concernment unto your ſouls, even to conſider that there is nothing between us and ſuch an unſpeakable dignity of being Kings and Prieſts unto the Eternal God: There is nothing on Gods part wanting, the Heavens are open, they bow down themſelves unto you on this behalf. If any man doth fall ſhort, let him know that there is nothing but only his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of ſpirit, which whileſt he doth harbour, and doth nor overcome, he cannot lay out his heart and ſoul ſo free in the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of thoſe Motives, which, were he intent upon, would do the deed, would amount to ſuch a holy and ſacred anointing, as now we ſpeak of, your <hi>being filled with the Spirit</hi> of God, whereby you would be made Prieſts of the Living God. So much for the Firſt Uſe of the Doctrine, the Uſe of Inſtruction.</p>

Wherein many things are further argued, proving the Holy Ghoſt to be the moſt High God.</head>
               <p>THe ſecond Uſe was a Uſe of Reproof, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> and this (in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) of all thoſe who are Enemies to this heavenly Exhortation, this bleſſed Counſel adminiſtred by the Holy Ghoſt unto men of being filled with the Spirit of God, who either by word, or by deed, or by both obſtruct the courſe of it, that it doth not run, is not glorified in the World as it ought to be. Of theſe kind of Offenders there are ſeveral Species or ſorts, highly cenſurable by the Divine Authority of the Doctrine and truth delivered. The firſt are they, who being ſtrangers altogether to the Spirit of God (the Spirit of which both the Text and and the Doctrine ſpeaketh) are full of the Spirit of the World (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the God of the World, <hi>Sathan;</hi>) who, inſtead of being full of the Spirit of God, laugh at all Diſcourſes of mens being filled with him (yea, or of ſo much as having the Spirit of God in them) to ſcorn; hearing from the mouths of faithful Miniſters of God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and it may be from the diſcourſe of other Chriſtians, that the Saints and Servants of God, ſuch who truly believe in Jeſus Chriſt, are led by the Spirit of God, and taught by him how to pray, how to walk holily, and ſoberly, and righteouſly in the World; they make a mock at it, as ſome of the more ignorant and prophane <hi>Jews</hi> did at the Apoſtles being filled with the Spirit we ſpeak of, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.13. When they ſpake with ſtrange Tongues, <hi>Others mocking</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>ſaid, theſe men are full of New-wine.</hi> When any thing of God, or of the Spirit of God more than ordinary, in one kind or other, appeareth in any of the Saints or Servants of God, they that are ignorant of God and of his waies, will never own or acknowledge the procedure of it to be from God; if they can but imagine any other cauſe, though with
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:95016:193"/>never ſo ſlight appearance, from whence there is the leaſt probability that it may proceed; yea, if they can imagine any cauſe in this caſe which is worſe than other, and which is more diſparaging unto the perſons in whom that grace and power of God, we ſpeak of, doth appear, this ſhall be the cauſe unto which the excellent work of God in his Saints ſhall be imputed and aſcribed. How little reaſon, or colour of reaſon was there to pretend or think that <hi>New Wine</hi> over-freely drank or taken by men ſhould put them into a capacity of ſpeaking with Tongues, ſtrange Tongues, ſuch as they never underſtood, or were able to ſpeak before? They knew well enough many of the Company that were there, or amongſt them, that every one that ſpake had a diſtinct knowledge of the Tongue of their own Nation; <hi>We hear them ſpeak all in our own Language</hi> (ſaid they.) Now (I ſay) let any ſober and conſidering man think but a little of the buſineſs, how impoſſible a thing it is that New Wine ſhould inveſt men with a capacity, and an ability to ſpeak with ſtrange Tongues, in a ſtrange language; yet rather than they would acknowledge that the Spirit was the Author thereof, they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to New Wine. New Wine may cauſe them to ſpeak freely and at random, but not in other Tongues; they may, indeed, ſpeak none<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, and not diſtinctly, or elſe that which no man can underſtand; but that it ſhould enable and qualifie men for the ſpeaking in ſtrange Tongues diſtinctly, and ſenſibly to the underſtanding of other men, there is not the leaſt colour, or the lighteſt pretenſe thus to argue: But ignorant perſons, and ſuch as are prophane, what will they not do to harden themſelves, though in the moſt irrational and ſenſeleſs manner that may be? And beſides, the things which the Apoſtles here ſpake and uttered, and which were underſtood by thoſe who ſo imputed the ſpeaking of them in variety of Languages, were <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalia,</hi> the great and wonderful things of God. If New Wine had been the inſpirer, theſe could not have been the great things of God that they had ſpoken, but the great things of the Devil, and of the World. So when the Lord Chriſt caſt out the unclean Spirit out of him that was poſſeſſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.24. it is ſaid, that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> preſently char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged this upon <hi>Sathan,</hi> and upon his having to do with him; becauſe the Devil is a ſupernatural Agent in that ſenſe which we uſually take ſupernatural: That is, he is able to do things which are ſtrange, and out of the courſe of Nature, therefore he is a kind of reſerve for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and wicked men; when they meet with any thing of God, and of the Spirit of God in the Saints, they have the Devil in readineſs to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute all theſe things unto. As I remember I have read in the Story of Martyrs, when any of the Martyrs ſhewed any invincible courage or patience, in the midſt of their torments, the Prieſts that ſtood by would ſtill perſwade the People that the Devil had bereaved them of their ſenſes, and had diſtracted them before the fire came at them; and by
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:95016:194"/>this kind of colour and feigned pretenſe they thought to way-lay, and to ſtop the courſe of the apprehenſion of the common ſort of People, leſt they ſhould think that there was any great appearance of God in them.</p>
               <p>So when the Lord Chriſt taught the People with ſo much wiſdom and underſtanding that they were aſtoniſhed, and the greateſt part of them began to admire, how he that had not known a Letter ſhould ſpeak at ſuch a rate as he did; it is ſaid they were offended at him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.57. implying, they thought that he came not by it lawfully, but by the help of the Devil; they could not make it out that he was a good man, becauſe they were ignorant of his gifts, therefore they fall foul upon the Lord Chriſt. So <hi>Paul</hi> in thoſe high ſtrains, whether in teaching, or rather in practice, or acting in the World, which the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> could not comprehend nor reconcile with ſuch Principles as they were acted by, was by the generality of them thought to be little better than crazed in his brain, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13. or head-ſhaken, and that too much Learning had made him mad; <hi>Whether we be beſide our ſelves, it is to God, or whether we be ſober it is for your ſakes.</hi> Now when he ſaith, whether we be beſides our ſelves, he doth not mean, that he acted any thing out of madneſs or diſtemper; nay, certainly he was never himſelf more than when he did act theſe things, for which they thought him beſides himſelf, and a man ſingular, and engaged with ſome odd kind of Speculations and Notions: and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, as for ſuch things as theſe, if we be beſides our ſelves, and like men diſtempered, we are this unto God, we have our eyes upon, and approve our ſelves unto him in theſe things; we eaſily believe you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what to make of them, you cannot make wiſdom, nor obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor ſubjection unto God in them; you do not underſtand nor comprehend thoſe Laws, nor thoſe Rules nor Principles by which we act and move in ſuch waies; but (ſaith he) we look unto God, and he underſtands it; though we ſpeak (as it were) in an unknown Tongue unto you, yet in a Language which God well knows and underſtands. But now (ſaith he) <hi>if we be ſober it is for your ſakes:</hi> in theſe things he had reſpect unto them, for their Edification. In like manner, when perſons are carried and lifted up by the power of the Spirit of God above the ordinary Line of men, either in ſpeaking or acting for the glory of God, or advantage of the Goſpel: Men that do not know and believe that there is any ſuch Spirit, at leaſt acting or working in men, are ready to blaſpheme him in his Saints, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the things that are wrought by the power of his Preſence in men to ſome diſhonourable and untoward Principle or other: as that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be led by the Spirit of God, whereas they do ſuch things upon their own fanſie, and upon ſome ſuch ſuggeſtion which Sathan hath put into them. As the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorian, ſpeaking of <hi>Nero</hi> the Monſter
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:95016:194"/>of men, reporteth his conceit to be, which he did expreſs publickly, that there was no man in the World but was as vicious as himſelf; only, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the difference between him and them, he was open and would act above board. and other men were more afraid: But he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that there was any ſuch thing as Temperance and Sobriety: Even ſo, this is the very ſtrain, and temper, and inward thoughts of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perſons in the World, that have no heart nor ſpirit for God, nor for waies of excellency that are lovely, and honourable. When they ſee that there are other men and women of their Ranke that do ſuch things which they cannot do: They cannot go along with them, they cannot faſt and pray, they cannot follow ſuch and ſuch Religious Duties, or Exerciſes; they think that theſe men do but diſſemble, they love their money as well as we, they love their eaſe as well as we, only the Devil tempteth them and putteth them upon theſe waies, that ſo they may have credit and repute, and be thought more holy and greater lovers of God than other men; and by this means they judge themſelves better, becauſe they know they are plain, and have no reſerves in their breaſts, but what they are in the frame of their hearts, and ſpirits, and affections, they act and utter themſelves accordingly: Whereas thoſe perſons that are externally ſo godly, and would be ſo judged, are every whit as bad or worſe than we, becauſe they ſeek to cover, and hide, and to diſſemble thoſe wicked and vile thoughts which are in them by an external ſhew of holineſs; they can take their turns privately, and ſecretly, to do the very ſelf ſame thing, or things that are worſe and more ſinful than any that we do. This is (I ſay) an expreſs ſtrain of the Spirit of that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Nero;</hi> This is the reaſon that ſuch perſons fall foul upon the Saints, eſpecially, when the Spirit ſhall draw them forth unto waies that are ſo excellent in their kind. Now, they that ſhall thus impute this to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, or unto the vile hearts of men, theſe are they who do obſtruct the force of this Exhortation, of mens being filled with the Spirit of God; and do what in them lie to make mens hearts to ſink, and to diſcourage them from ſeeking after ſuch a Royal Priviledge.</p>

Inſtances might readily be given in many particulars in this kind,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:95016:195"/>we ſhall conſider the truth of the Obſervation (at preſent) only in the Point in hand: For what doth ſuch a Doctrine or Notion as this, That the Spirit, the Holy Ghoſt is not God, but only a finite Spirit, being interpreted, ſignifie, but that it is but in vain for men and women ſo much as to think of ever being filled with him, and conſequently, of ever being excellent? For fuſt, the Created Spirits, the good Angels, are Miniſters and Servants (even all of them, without exception of any) unto the Saints, as they are Members of that body, whereof their Lord and Maſter Chriſt is the head. We know that place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Are they not all Miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation?</hi> So then, Angels, however, in reſpect of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and dignity of their natures, they be ſuperiour unto men, yet in reſpect of that Miniſtry and Service unto men, whereunto they are deputed and ſet forth by God, they are inferiour unto them. Now the heart and ſoul of man cannot frame and bring it ſelf to expect or look for from its fellow Creatures (eſpecially, ſuch a Creature which God, in reſpect of Miniſtry and Service, hath ſubjected unto it) any thing ſo excellent, or ſo deſirable, as it reaſonably may work and prevail with its ſelf, to expect or promiſe unto it ſelf, from its Creator, from a Spirit that is infinite in his being, and an inexhauſt Abyſs of all excellency. My Brethren, it is repugnant to the inbred nature, and innate Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the heart and ſoul of a man, to go forth with a like cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, alacrity, or confidence to ſeek its deſires or ſupplies, where either he knows not whether they are to be found and had or no, or at the beſt knows for a certain that they are but ſparingly, and with a kind of malignity and ſcantneſs to be found; and to go forth upon this account, where he certainly knows, that what he deſireth, and what his ſoul longeth for, is lodged, and is to be had in the greateſt plenty and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. He ſpake as a man that thoroughly underſtood the natural frame and propenſion of the heart of a man (in that particular we now ſpeak of) who ſaid, <hi>Dulce eſt de magno tollere Acervo:</hi> It is a thing marvellouſly ſatisfactory and pleaſing to the heart of a man to be ſtill taking from a great heap; and upon this ground are thoſe Proverbial Sayings; <hi>There is no fiſhing like to a fiſhing in the ſea, no ſervice like the Service of a King;</hi> becauſe in one there is the greateſt plenty and abundance of that kind of pleaſure that Fiſhers look after: And for them that ſerve, and muſt live by their ſervice, there is none like that of Princes, becauſe they have abundance of reward, and of opportunity whereby to recompenſe the Services of thoſe that do wait and attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: and that is the reaſon why our Saviour in the tenth of <hi>John,</hi> to render and make men ſo much the more free and willing to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him for the life that they ſtand in need of, doth inform them, that he hath not a competency, or a ſufficiency only of this life, but that he hath plenty and abundance of it. Speaking of his Sheep (ſaith he) <hi>I am
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:95016:195"/>come that they might have life,</hi> and not ſimply that they might have life, but that <hi>they might have it in abundance</hi> [or more abundantly;] as who ſhould ſay, If there were only life in Jeſus Chriſt, or if it were there in meaſure only, and in a ſcanty proportion, this would be ſome kind of regret, and men would make a ſtand in their coming; but ſince he is come upon ſuch terms, that all that come to him might have it in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; this is a motive that doth accommodate, and fall in with the Natures and with the Principles of the heart and ſoul of men. And upon the ſame ground it is that the Scriptures, in ſeveral places, do not only aſſert and teſtifie that God is merciful and gracious, but abundant in mercy, and full of Grace; and not ſimply that there is Redemption in him, but plentiouſneſs of Redemption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.5.15. 103.8. &amp; 130.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>let him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy, and unto our God for he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon.</hi> The Commodity which we ſtand in need of is mercy, and the pardon of our ſins, in caſe we have been unholy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Creatures; this commodity is abundantly in God: There it is treaſured up as waters are in the Store-houſe of the Sea; There is no end of the Treaſures of his Grace, Mercy, Pardon, and Compaſſion. There is no man being in want, but had ten times rather go to a rich mans door to be relieved, than to the door of a poor man, if he knoweth the rich man to be as liberal and as bountifully diſpoſed as the poor man can be. Theſe Proverbial Sayings amongſt us, <hi>Better leave than lack; Where more is, more is to be had;</hi> are of a conſonant import unto the former, and they all joyntly and ſeverally declare this, that men generally love to ſeek their deſires where they are in the greateſt abundance likely to be found. Now then, they who go about to ſend men, for a filling, to ſuch a Spirit that can but fill them in meaſure, and with a ſtraitned and malign quantity, in compariſon of what an increated Spirit is able to do, certainly they do as much as ſuch an error can do to obſtruct and prejudice the way of men in ſuch a courſe as this; What do they elſe but cool, if not wholly quench, the deſires, and together with theſe, the endeavours of ſuch who are obedient unto the Doctrine, who are in a way of being filled with the Spirit?</p>
               <p>We formerly mentioned a Touchſtone to try whether any Doctrine (which is preſented to us) be an Evangelical truth or no; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> and that was this, If it be for the advancement of Godlineſs, for the Goſpel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Doctrine according unto Godlineſs; as the Holy Ghoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth it; that is, ſo framed and conſtituted, of ſuch and ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Promiſes, Counſels, and Exhortations, as if they were made on purpoſe to advance Godlineſs, and promote the Intereſt of it: And if this be the nature and frame of it in the general, then every limbe and vain of it muſt have a tendency the ſame way; therefore whatſoever Opinion, Notion, or Conceit it be, if it cutteth the Sinews of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:95016:196"/>or riſeth up againſt the Intereſt thereof, and cauſeth men to look off and aſide from it; this is a moſt certain ſign and proof againſt it that it is no part or branch of the Goſpel, but an imagination and lying conceit, which hath been engendered and begotten in the dark thoughts of the hearts of men, or perhaps rather by a worſe hand; I mean, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, who doth nothing elſe but ſtudy and invent Opinions, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and Imaginations, which may have ſome colour of truth, that ſo they may fall in with the Judgments of men: He doth invent, and mint, and ſet ſuch Opinions abroad in the World, and then his next work is, as far as poſſibly he can, to find out Agents and Inſtruments, the beſt he can prevail withal, and which are fitted and prepared to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his deſign in the World: And the better men are, the more lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the more innocent in their lives and converſations (can they be prevailed withal) theſe are the choſen veſſels for him, and fitted for his turn. Herein the Devil imitateth the Great God: for as God, when he hath a deſign to make manifeſt his moſt ſpiritual truths, and moſt holy things, maketh choiſe of the worthieſt and holieſt men, men that are of the beſt acceptance with the people round about them, becauſe they are likelieſt to take ſo much the better: So doth the greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Peace and Salvation of the World, he follows God as near at the heels as he can come; if he finds any man better than others, he ſhall do his work; and if he cannot find any many of ſuch qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (as we ſpeak of) then he muſt be content with others; for he hath a deſire that his Opinion ſhould be promoted, though never ſo unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. There is great reaſon (by the way) why Sathan ſhould ſet abroad, all the waies he can, ſuch Opinions in the World which are derogatory from the honour of the Son of God, and from the Spirit of God; partly, becauſe by this means that he hath the more advantage to derogate from either of theſe in their eſteem and honour amongſt men: And partly, becauſe the works of Creation being appropriate unto God the Father principally, and not the work of Redemption, Sathans chief work lies to undermine the Godhead of thoſe perſons to whom that work is moſt appropriate, and who are moſt engaged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. For the Son of God is his great Enemy, and the Perſon who threateneth his undoing, and the Ruine of all that he hath gotten, by drawing men aſide from God. And then likewiſe, the Holy Ghoſt hath put to his ſupreme hand, all his work being bent againſt the Devil and his Temptations. Now in reaſon it cannot be thought, but that he (Satan) will be more engaged againſt theſe, to bring their Godhead (if it be poſſible) into queſtion, and to deſtroy the belief of it out of the World. He that doth but know the nature of him, as that he is full of malice, miſchief, and bloud, and that he is ready to riſe up againſt God himſelf, as far as he is able, I ſay, they that do but know the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſo far, cannot wonder at it, or think it ſtrange that he ſhould labour
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:95016:196"/>to fill the World, in all the quarters of it, with ſuch kind of Notions and Opinions, that ſhall make the greateſt breaches upon the honour and reverence that is gotten up into the hearts of men, both towards the Lord Chriſt, God bleſſed for ever, and the Holy Ghoſt, that Spirit of God by whom the Children of God are ſealed to the day of their Redemption.</p>
               <p>But as the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> in a caſe not much unlike, demands, <hi>What is the Chaff to the Wheat?</hi> So may we ſay, What is finite to that which is infinite? What is a Creature for the carrying on of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World in compariſon of the great Creator?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whereas there are a thouſand thouſands, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times ten thouſands Saints upon the Earth, and theſe in places far diſtant from one another, to be <hi>filled</hi> at the ſame time <hi>with the Spirit</hi> of God, or that may be engaged with their hearts and ſouls in waies and means to be thus filled with the Spirit; if the Spirit which ſhould fill them in this kind be a created, a finite Spirit, limited and confined to one and the ſame place, at one and the ſame time (for this muſt be his condition if he be finite;) How can theſe be raiſed to any ground of hope that ever they ſhould be filled with the Spirit? For if he be a finite Spirit it is impoſſible that he ſhould fill any more than one perſon at a time, and ſo muſt depart and withdraw thence to fill ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And</p>
               <p>As <hi>Andrew</hi> ſaid (<hi>Joh.</hi> 6.9.) of that ſlender proviſion which was to be had in compariſon of the great multitude that were to be fed, <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Lad here which hath five barley Loaves, and two ſmall Fiſhes; but what are theſe amongſt ſo many?</hi> So may we well demand and ask, in the caſe before us, there being ſuch vaſt numbers and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes to be filled with the Spirit, What is a limited, a finite, a created Spirit to fill them all? What is ſuch a Spirit as this <hi>amongſt ſo many</hi> thouſands, ſuch an infinite number of men and women, who all are labouring to be filled with the Spirit? How is it poſſible he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate ſuch a numberleſs number of Saints, ſo as to make them all glad? Therefore they who teach men, that the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit that ſhall <hi>fill</hi> them, is but a Creature like unto themſelves, in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitedneſs and fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iteneſs of being, do by theſe whom it concerns to be filled with the Spirit, and in order hereunto, advance in their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours accordingly, much as thoſe Spies of old did by the <hi>Iſraelites, Num.</hi> 13.32. who by bringing an evil report upon the good Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and telling them that it was a Land that did eat up the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of it diſcouraged the hearts of the People from attempting the Conqueſt, and poſſeſſion of it, if it had not been for <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhuah;</hi> whoſe hearts were more upright: In like manner, they that bring up ſuch a report as this upon the Spirit, as that he is but a finite Spirit, a created Spirit, a ſtraitned Spirit, what do they do elſe but diſcourage the hearts and weaken the hands of thoſe who have given out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:95016:197"/>and have their hands lifted up to ſuch an exerciſe, and make Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſuch an heavenly advice and piece of Counſel as this is of being <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> of the ever bleſſed God? And beſides, if the Spirit we ſpeak of, with which the Saints are to be filled, be a <hi>finite Spirit,</hi> ſuppoſe he could at any time mind and attend them all, all over the World from the Eaſt to the Weſt, and from the North to the South in their ſeveral applications of themſelves to obtain ſuch a filling; yet he could actually fill but one perſon, one heart, or one ſoul at once, and therefore when he hath filled one, he muſt empty him again by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himſelf from him before he can fill another; becauſe it is impoſſible that he ſhould fill them all with himſelf at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <p>If it be replied, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> but he may be ſaid to fill the Saints with himſelf, although he doth not abide alwaies perſonally preſent with them, (<hi>viz.</hi> by leaving ſtrong impreſſions of himſelf, his grace and power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts and ſpirits, though in perſon he be withdrawn from them:) as thoſe Saints or Chriſtians, amongſt whom <hi>Paul</hi> had been preaching the Goſpel, and had not only prevailed with them to believe, but had put them into a zealous poſture of profeſſion, and made them like unto himſelf, theſe may be ſaid to be filled with <hi>Paul,</hi> or with <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpirit.</p>
               <p>I reply, That holy and zealous impreſſions upon the hearts and ſpirits of men may be declarative of their being filled with the Spirit of God, but they are not properly and formally their filling, or their being filled with this Spirit; they are but the ſuites, ſymptoms, or ſigns of their being <hi>filled</hi> therewith, as the Grapes that grow upon the Vine are not the Vine it ſelf. <hi>A being filled with the Spirit</hi> implies an actual reſidence, or abode of the Spirit himſelf in men, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17. <hi>And I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever,</hi> he, in perſon, not in his gifts or operations only. So in the next verſe, <hi>And he ſhall be in you.</hi> And the Apoſtle maketh a plain and expreſs difference between the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Spirit, and the Gifts of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5. <hi>Now there are diverſities of gifts, but the ſame Spirit:</hi> So verſe 11. <hi>But all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit.</hi> And the Scripture from place to place ſpeaketh of the Holy Ghoſt as perſonally inhabiting or reſiding in the Saints, as in theſe and the like expreſſions and paſſages, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. <hi>That good thing which was committed unto thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>) <hi>keep by the Holy Ghoſt which</hi> [or who] <hi>dwelleth in us;</hi> the gifts or operations of the Holy Ghoſt, though they may in a metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and improper ſenſe be ſaid to dwell in men (as <hi>Timothies</hi> Faith is ſaid firſt to have dwelt in his Grand-mother <hi>Lois,</hi> and in his Mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> ver. 5.) yet in a direct or proper ſenſe it cannot ſo be ſaid of them. Now where there is no neceſſity enforcing a Metaphorical ſenſe, a
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:95016:197"/>proper ſenſe is ſtill to be preferred: beſides an unproper ſenſe here, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt to underſtand the gifts or operations of the Holy Ghoſt, would be very incongruous and hard; as thus, The good thing committed unto thee, keep, by the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt which dwell in us, or by the Holy Ghoſt which in or by his gifts dwelleth in us. So again, <hi>Grieve not the Spirit of God, whereby you are ſealed unto the day of redemption, Eph.</hi> 4.30. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.10. So it is ſaid of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, that they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.12. &amp; <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3, 4. &amp; 10.44. &amp; 19.6. It would be very incongruous and harſh, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand theſe Scriptures, and many others of the like Character and import, only of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Nor will it at all relieve that moſt dangerous Notion and Conceit which we now oppoſe, to pretend and ſay, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> that though there be but one Holy Ghoſt, or one Holy Spirit to whom the Attribute of Holineſs is appropriately aſcribed, and he termed the Holy Spirit, yet there are many other Spirits, multitude of angels which are aſſiſtant unto him, who may poſſibly be as many in number as there are Saints in the World at one time, yea, and poſſibly more; ſo that theſe Spirits amongſt them may attend the Saints in all places and parts of the World at one and the ſame time; and inaſmuch as there is one Supreme amongſt them, by whom all the reſt are directed and employed in their way, all that is done by them all may be aſcribed unto him: as becauſe there is one head, or one Principal amongſt the Devils, who is ſaid to be the Prince of the Devils, who is termed ſometimes Sathan, ſometimes <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> and Prince of the Devils; therefore all that is done, all the temptations that are managed in the World, by all that are amongſt them, are in Scripture aſcribed unto Sathan, or unto the Devil indefinitely, and in the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number; and if the Devil, who is confeſſed on all hands to be a created and finite Spirit, be ſaid in Scripture to tempt men, though in never ſo remote places one from another at the ſame time; why may not the Holy Ghoſt be ſaid to fill men with himſelf upon the like terms, <hi>viz.</hi> in all the places of the Earth at the ſame time, though he be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a finite Spirit alſo? If we had time we ſhould plainly ſhew unto you that this is nothing but a piece of Sackcloath ſpun on purpoſe, and devized to ſpread over the face of the Sun; It is nothing but a vain flouriſh to hide this great and worthy truth of God from the eyes of the World; to take off the minds and hearts of men from looking after ſuch a worthy and bleſſed enjoyment, as a being filled with the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>For firſt, We ſhall ſhew you that there is not any ground in Scripture or Reaſon to ſuppoſe that any one Angel ſhould have the ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency or diſpoſing of all the reſt of the Angels to order them to their ſeveral Employments, Works, or Actions; I ſay, there is no word, nor the leaſt breathing or whiſper of any ſuch thing as this; but the Scriptures
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:95016:198"/>rather look another way, namely, to ſhew that all the good and holy Angels (who are employed on the behalf of the Saints) receive their Commiſſion immediately from God himſelf, or from the Lord Chriſt, who is repreſented in the Scripture as their great Lord and Maſter: They ſtand charged there with Loyalty and Homage to him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>When he bringeth in the firſt begotten in the World, he ſaith, and Tet all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God worſhip him.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Are they not all Miniſtring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits ſent forth,</hi> &amp;c? They are ſent forth by him (whoſe Angels they are) about their ſeveral Miniſtries. And that is the reaſon too (I ſuppoſe) of that Expreſſion of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.10. who ſpeaking of the little ones, who did believe in him, ſaith, <hi>I ſay unto you that in Heaven their Angels do alwaies behold the face of my Father which is in heaven;</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they do ſtand continually in the preſence of God, and there behold his face, looking and waiting to receive ſome Commiſſion or other, longing for ſervice and employment from him; it is their life, it is their glory and felicity to attend the ſervices that ſhall be commanded them by God; and therefore they do ſtand as Servants of a King, who ſaith to one, do this; and to another, do that; to one, go this way; and to another, go that way: So do all the Angels in heaven ſtand round about the Throne of the Great God, every one of them being greedy of Service, to have ſome Meſſage and Intimation from God what to do. This therefore argueth, that they do not receive their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from any created Angel, as they themſelves are, but that they have it directly and immediately from God himſelf, or from Jeſus Chriſt; as <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.51. <hi>And he ſaith unto him, verily verily I ſay unto you, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ye ſhall ſee the heavens open, and the Angels of God aſcending, and deſcending upon the Son of man;</hi> they do not aſcend and deſcend upon one of themſelves, the Inferiour upon the Superiour Angels; no, but on the Son of man; (meaning himſelf) as they did, and were to be ſeen ſoon after; for they did attend upon him at his Reſurrection, they removed the Stone off from the Grave, and they went to give notice of his riſing again unto thoſe who came to ſeek after him; and ſo in his Aſcenſion, he went up with a mighty noiſe, and is to deſcend again with the ſound of a Trumpet. Now, this he calls the opening of Heaven, <hi>viz.</hi> the full diſcovery of thoſe heavenly things, which as yet had not been made known or manifeſted unto the World; as namely, that he is the great orderer, or great Lord and Maſter of the Angels, and that they were all his Servants; ſo that this very Notion of one Angel having the ſuperiour command and dominion over all the reſt of the Angels, is contrary to Scriptures, and cannot be proved from them. There is no ground to conceive, that whatever the Angels do, throughout their whole body, and in all places of the earth, ſhould be aſcribed to ſuch an Angel. Sathan (indeed) hath a Kingdom aſcribed (in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures) unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.26. and he is ſaid to be the Prince of the
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:95016:198"/>Devils (as we heard) but the Angels are no where ſaid to be a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, neither have they any head or chief. Angel amongſt them, nor can it be proved that any one Angel, hath a ſuperiority over another; the reaſon (I conceive) of this difference may be, becauſe the holy Angels continuing in their obedience and loyalty unto God, are all of them great Officers and Miniſters of State in his Kingdom, and have not a Kingdom by themſelves, or apart from his: Whereas Sathan with his Complices, not keeping and maintaining their obedience and loyalty unto God, and ſo not keeping their ſtanding in his love and favour, but being caſt out thereof they become a Kingdom by themſelves, and have one in chief over them.</p>
               <p>It is very probable that there are ſeveral ranks and degrees of Angels, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> from <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. and again, from <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12. and ſome other places in Scriptures do ſeem to give this kind of overture, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are ſeveral ranks and orders of Angels; and it is not much improbable but that there is a ſubordination amongſt them, and that ſome are of a Superiour Order, and ſome of an Inferiour; and that every rank hath one that is the principal or ſuperintendent over the reſt of the ſame rank (though this be but conjectural too.) We read in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of Arch-Angels in the Scriptures, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. So <hi>Jude ver.</hi> 9. in this latter place the Arch-Angel ſpoken off, is called by his proper name <hi>Michael,</hi> which rather imports a Species, or order of ſuch Angels, than that there is only one Arch-Angel, and his name <hi>Michael;</hi> for if there had been but one Arch-Angel, it had been more proper to have ſaid <hi>the Arch-Angel,</hi> without calling him by his proper name, which ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſerveth to diſtinguiſh one perſon from another of the ſame Species; and <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Michael</hi> is called <hi>one of the chief Princes</hi> (which importeth that there are more of the ſame order) <hi>i. e.</hi> one of the <hi>Arch-Angels,</hi> though perhaps the firſt of them (as the Margin gives you the liberty of reading it.) Though for good order they have one that doth precede or go before, yet that there ſhould be any one that ſhould have the ſovereign power, or rule, and ordering of all the reſt of all ranks and orders, is contrary to reaſon, and hath no footing in Scripture. Concerning the other place mentioned, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. where we have it tranſlated, <hi>with a ſhout, and with the voice of the Arch-Angel,</hi> as if there were one ſuch Angel and no more; the truth is, according to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Greek, it may rather be read, <hi>With the voice of an Arch-Angel,</hi> for it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not with an Article, but without, and ſo doth ſignifie one of a great number.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Schoolmen, who have (many of them) addicted themſelves to the ſtudy and contemplation of theſe things which are held forth in the Scriptures concerning the Angels (whoſe Notions in theſe ſpeculations are leſs to be ſuſpected of partiality, ſeeing they relate not to any difference and controverſie between them; nor yet to the
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:95016:199"/>eſtabliſhment of the Papal Chair; and therefore they in their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and conceptions are not like to be any whit prejudiced herein.) Now then they generally hold, not only that there is an Order, and diſtinct Band, or Regiment of Arch-Angels, but that there are many other Orders of Celeſtial Spirits above them, as <hi>Cherubins, Seraphins, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Thrones,</hi> &amp;c. yea, and that they are the loweſt of all others, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe that have the common name of Angels appropriate unto them; and they give an account of this opinion, and have their Scriptures for all theſe things, though it may be they may not all hold weight if they be examined, yet they have an appearance of reaſon for what they ſay.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Jewiſh Rabbies hold and teach, that there are more Arch-Angels than one, and they undertake to call them by their names, One, they call be the name <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riel;</hi> a ſecond, <hi>Raphael;</hi> a third, <hi>Gabriel;</hi> a fourth, <hi>Michael;</hi> a fifth, <hi>Nuriel:</hi> But it is alſo the ſenſe of ſome that are more ſober and conſiderate, that there are more Arch-Angels though we meet with this name but in one or two places in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Scriptures ſeem to imply and teach, that all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels that are employed at any time about the Saints, and for their benefit, are immediately commiſſioned and ſent forth about their reſpective Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations by God himſelf, or by Jeſus Chriſt to whom they ſtand char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with fealty and homage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. (a place lately inſiſted on, upon another occaſion) <hi>Let all the Angels worſhip him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> In caſe it ſhould be granted (which yet never was, nor, I believe, ever will be proved) that there is one Angel placed by God in any ſuch ſuperintendency over all the reſt of the Angels, from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all their Orders, and Commiſſions, concerning all their tranſactions, or all that they are to execute and do in the World; yet it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from hence neither, that this Angel muſt preſently be that Spirit which is ſurnamed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, holy, or the Spirit of God, which is ſaid to be given unto his Saints, and thoſe who do believe, as the earneſt of their inheritance: by whom they are ſealed up to the day of their Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; who in Scripture is dignified as the Author and Donor of all the ſpiritual gifts mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. with whom (in the Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us) we are all exhorted to be filled. This is no where to be found in the Scriptures, neither hath it foundation, nor piece of foundation there. If it could (I ſay) be ſuppoſed and granted, for Arguments ſake, that there ſhould be an Angel in chief over all the reſt, yet this doth not follow that this Spirit in our Text is an Angel, and not the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Though it be ſuppoſed and taken for granted that men and women are tempted unto ſin and wickedneſs at one and the ſame time all the World over; yet it cannot be proved that they are tempted by
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:95016:199"/>the Devil, whether <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> or any under him: <hi>But every one</hi> (ſaith <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 1.14.) <hi>is tempted when he is drawn away</hi> (or being drawn away) <hi>of his own luſt and enticed;</hi> meaning, that there are Luſts found in every man, which perform the Work or Office of a Tempter, ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwading and enclining them unto waies and Actions which are ſinful, and which many times prevail in this kind, when there is no other Tempter at all that hath to do with them: So that the tempting of men and women unto evil, in never ſuch numbers or multitudes at one and the ſame time in the World, doth not argue that the Devil, the Prince of Devils, either immediately by himſelf, or mediately by any under-Devil tempteth them: But certain it is, that when ever the Saints ſtir or move in any good way, pray, meditate, hear, and attend the good Word of God in any part of the World, that the Spirit of God is with them, quickning and exciting them to theſe things, and ſtrengthening them in the performance thereof; becauſe there is no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in men unto that which is good, but that which is raiſed and drawn forth by the Spirit of God in them. Hence you ſee, that that which is ſuppoſed, or taken for granted in the Objection in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Devil is ſaid to tempt, all the World over, at one and the ſame time, is an airy and looſe ſuppoſition, and hath no ſtable Baſis or Foundation to ſupport it: neither doth it hold parallel with the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe it is poſſible that men and women may be tempted, and yet not by the Devil. It is true the Devil doth compaſs the Earth to and fro: but we ſee it cannot be concluded, that every temptation to ſin and wickedneſs is from the Devil, becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that a man when he is tempted, he is drawn away with his own Luſt and enticed; ſo that if there were no Devils, men might be drawn away with their own Luſts.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Concerning thoſe that are tempted, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> or ſaid to be tempted by the Devil, there is no ſuch emphatical, punctual, or preciſe limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or appropriation of their temptations to one unclean Spirit or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as there is of all the variety of ſpiritual gifts unto one holy spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Now there are diverſities of gifts</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>but the ſame Spirit.</hi> It is no where ſaid, that there are varieties of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the ſame Tempter, or the ſame tempting Spirit. Again, <hi>To one is given by the Spirit the word of Wiſdom, to another the word of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by the ſame Spirit: to another Faith by the ſame Spirit; to another working of Miracles, to another Propheſie, to another diſcerning of Spirits, to another divers kinds of Tongues, to another the interpretation of Tongues, but all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit,</hi> Ver. 8, 9, 10, 11. A man would think by theſe expreſſions, eſpecially by the laſt, <hi>but all theſe worketh one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit;</hi> that the Apoſtle had foreſeen that there would in time riſe up ſuch a Generation of men in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World, whom he meant to way-lay in their errour, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:95016:200"/>who would deny the Divinity of the Spirit; yea, and would pretend and plead, by way of countenance for their errour, that there are many Spirits, and that theſe amongſt them perform all thoſe operations, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſe all thoſe gifts, the performance, and diſpenſation whereof are the peculiar and appropriate praiſe of <hi>one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, viz.</hi> that Spirit which is infinite, increated, and God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, The Apoſtle (a little before the paſſages now cited, <hi>viz. ver.</hi> 4, 5. compared) plainly enough teacheth or ſuppoſeth, that as there are no more Lords than one, notwithſtanding the variety of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations; ſo there are no more Spirits but one, notwithſtanding the great variety and diverſity of gifts: <hi>Now there are diverſity of gifts, but the ſame Spirit; and there are differences of adminiſtrations, but the ſame Lord; the ſame Spirit, and the ſame Lord.</hi> Is it not rational to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from hence, that the Apoſtle did, not own or acknowledge any more Spirits intereſſed in giving or beſtowing the great multiplicity and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſpiritual gifts (which in theſe times (eſpecially) of which the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh did abound in all Chriſtian Churches) Than he did acknowledge Lords in the diſpoſing of the ſeveral Adminiſtrations of thoſe gifts? Now thoſe Enemies of the Spirit of God (I mean, to the Divinity of this Spirit) with whom we have now to do, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and acknowledge, that there is but one Lord [<hi>i. e.</hi> but one Jeſus Chriſt] though they count it no Sacriledge to rob him alſo of his equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with God; they confeſs him indeed to be God (the Scriptures in plain and expreſs words affirming this:) but what manner or kind of God they would make him, neither do I, nor (I ſuppoſe) themſelves well know. For they deny him to be the moſt High God, and ſo they ſeem to make him ſome demy-God. But this only by the way. By the conſideration, now inſiſted upon, and ſuggeſted by the Apoſtle, it plainly appeareth, that however there be Legions of Tempters, or of Devils who may tempt at the ſame time in ſeveral places of the World, and all theſe temptations be aſcribed to the Devil, or to the Prince of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, becauſe of their ſubordination unto him in ſuch actions; yet there is no ſuch number of theſe holy Spirits, who fill the Saints with their preſence all over the World at the ſame time. No, But that this is one and the ſame Spirit, who upon this account muſt needs be God.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, Whereas the Apoſtle (<hi>verſe</hi> 11 of the late mentioned Chapter) aſcribeth ſuch a liberty to the Spirit as to divide to every man as he pleaſeth <hi>(But all theſe worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit, dividing to every man ſeverally as he will;)</hi> Is not this alſo of like preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant intimation, that he looked upon him as God? For hath God ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted any ſuch Prerogative in any Angel, or created Spirit, to govern the World, to Umpire, or adminiſter the Affairs of the Children of men after their own will and pleaſure? Or is not the diſpoſing and beſtowing
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:95016:200"/>of thoſe excellent gifts and endowments, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaks ſo much in that Contexture of Scripture mentioned, a conſiderable vein and piece of the Government of the World? For what other thing (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt) can we look upon, that is ſo conſiderable in the Government and Miniſtration of the Affairs of the World as the diſpoſing of thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent gifts and endowments? Now then, he that gives out and diſpenſes theſe as he will and pleaſeth, is no Creature: No Creature hath the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of theſe Maſter diſpenſations in his own hand, and at his own diſpoſure: none but God himſelf.</p>
               <p n="10">10ly. Comparing the ſaid <hi>ver.</hi> 11. now cited, with <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> of the Chapter, we may have a light clear enough to ſee that the Apoſtle ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Spirit, of which he all along ſpeaketh, to be God. <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. He had ſaid, <hi>There are diverſities of operations, but it is the ſame God which worketh all in all:</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 11. He ſaith thus, <hi>But all theſe things worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame Spirit.</hi> Therefore <hi>the ſame God,</hi> of which he ſpake in the former verſe, and <hi>the ſame Spirit,</hi> of which he ſpeaks in the latter verſe, are one and the ſame God; the <hi>working</hi> of the ſame things being, reſpectively, aſcribed to him. Nor can it, with any colour of reaſon here be pretended, that the ſame actions may be, and frequently are in Scripture aſcribed unto God, and unto the Creature. God is often ſaid to ſave men, and ſo <hi>Timothy</hi> is ſaid to ſave men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. So here God may be ſaid to work all theſe things, and the Spirit may be ſaid to work all theſe things alſo; although it be ſuppoſed that the Spirit is a Creature. The reaſon why this pretenſe will not ſerve here is.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe though the ſame attribution here in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of Scripture, he made unto God, and then unto the Spirit of God; yet there is not the leaſt intimation given of any different conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, wherein the action is aſcribed unto God, and wherein it is aſcribed unto the Holy Ghoſt; whereas for all thoſe other Scriptures the very tenour of the words, and many of the Phraſes do give light ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient whereby to diſcern when God is ſaid to do ſuch and ſuch a thing, and when the ſame action is attributed to the Creature; and in what ſenſe it is aſcribed unto the one, and unto the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The clauſe formerly taken notice of, <hi>dividing unto every man as he will</hi> (ſpeaking of the Spirit) plainly ſheweth, that the Spirit in working and giving the gifts here ſpoken of, acteth in the capacity of God, or of an independent being, who hath power to order and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage all things according to the counſel of his will: and not as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for it is the Character of every Creature and ſecond Agent or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument not to act any thing according to his own will, but according to the will of the Principal Agent.</p>
               <p n="11">11ly. That Spirit which is to fill all the Saints, had need to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Now we know, that this Prerogative of ſearching the hearts, and trying the reins, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture appropriates unto God; yea, and all Interpreters have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it as one of his incommunicable properties. To make this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a univerſal and ſtanding Priviledge to any created being whatſoever; What is this but to rob God of that which is incommunicable, and to transfer upon the Creature that which is beyond its Line, a priviledge only commenſurable unto him that is God himſelf, and appropriate unto his own tranſcendent glory?</p>
               <p n="12">12ly. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> Let me add one thing more, which I have had occaſion given me to think of and conſider, ſince I laſt ſpake unto you, by means of a little book which came to my hand lately (I ſuppoſe) publiſhed by that importune Spirit, which laboureth might and main to fill the World with diſhonourable thoughts (at leaſt comparatively) concerning the Holy Ghoſt; unweariedly propagating and ſpreading abroad this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Opinion which we oppoſe. As it is ſaid of ſome, who have itching ears, heaping up Teachers after their own Luſts; ſo there are Teachers who have itching heads, and are reſtleſs in drawing Diſciples after them. Now in this little Book, in a ſhort Epiſtle directed to the Chriſtian Reader, prefixed by the Author unto this Book, he conjures his Reader, as he tenders his own ſalvation, that he would thoroughly examine his diſputation and diſcourſe; plainly enough intimating here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that without being of his opinion and judgment which according to the ſenſe of thoſe who underſtand the Scripture, yea, and ſound Principles of Reaſon better than he, judgeth that he breatheth no leſs than blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt; yet by the ſaid conjurement of his Reader he plainly enough declares his ſenſe to be, that without being of his mind, in denying the Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt, there is no ſalvation. Now I cannot but look upon this as little leſs than, or next to a demonſtrative Argument againſt that opinion which is obtruded upon the World upon thoſe terms; and that the opinion it ſelf is erronious and of a dangerous conſequence unto men.</p>
               <p>For it is matter of ready obſervation, that when men take up any new or by opinion, which they deſire for the honour of their names, and glory of their parts and abilities to propagate in the World; and being not furniſhed to their minds with grounds and reaſons otherwiſe to convince and ſatisfie the judgments of men about them, they are ſtill wont to attempt the amuſing and ſtumbling the Conſciences and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men by a confident and importune bearing them in hand that the opinion which they commend unto them is no leſs than matter of eternal Life, and eternal Death. Thus the Jewiſh Doctors, in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, would bear the Chriſtians in hand (<hi>Acts</hi> 15.1.) That except
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:95016:201"/>they were <hi>circumcized after the Law of Moſes they could not be ſaved:</hi> We ſee here they made Circumciſion a matter of life and death; and that not Circumciſion only, or ſimply; but Circumciſion after that manner and mode. But the Apoſtle knew better what did belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Circumciſion, and taught them a contrary Doctrine; <hi>I Paul</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſay unto you, if you be circumcized Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</hi> And the truth is, that ſuch Notions and Doctrines for the moſt part, which are thruſt upon men, or violently urged upon their Judgments and Conſciences, upon ſuch an account as this, as they ſtand charged, as they love their Souls, or deſire Salvation to entertain this, or that for truth, theſe are more contrary and deſtructive than other to the ſalvation of the Promoters and Abettors of them. As particularly, I believe, with the conſent of all the ancient Fathers, that this Opinion, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which denieth the Holy Ghoſt to be God, is deſtructive unto the ſalvation of men; deſtructive certainly it is, whether deſtruction al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies follows actually or no: The tendency and courſe of it, if it be not otherwiſe hindered, will lead men to deſtruction; but it may be hampered with other croſs Doctrines in Chriſtian Religion, and ſo eternal ruine, haply, may be prevented. The Chriſtian Learning that was in the World in thoſe Fathers daies could not tell how to frame and build up the body of Chriſtian Religion, nor how to make head or foot of the Goſpel without this Doctrine, that the Holy Ghoſt was one and the ſame God with the Father, and with the Son; and yet now we have a quite contrary commended unto us, and thruſt upon us, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch terms, as that we hazard the loſs of ſalvation, unleſs we be of the ſame mind with them that deny the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt. But to let you ſee how inconſiſtent men of this mind are with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, there is another that is full of the ſame opinion, denying both the Godhead of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, that yet find faults with thoſe that are oppoſite unto him for handling and writing ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and fully concerning the great Myſterie of the Trinity, and he maketh this his pretenſe: That however the caſe be, if it ſhould be ſo ſure as we ſay, yet we trouble and intangle the thoughts and minds of the Common people: And the reaſon is, becauſe the Doctrine of the Trinity is no waies neceſſary unto ſalvation. This is the ſenſe of another, as great a Maſter in his way, and one who was able to ſay as much or more to this Opinion than they that are troubleſome to us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p n="13">13ly. (and laſtly) For this, ſuppoſe we that there be ſome yet unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> that cannot tell which way to turn themſelves; becauſe it may be there is ſo much ſaid on the one hand, and on the other, that they are at a loſs within themſelves, and troubled in their ſpirits becauſe they cannot reach or attain that fulneſs of aſſurance in Judgment or Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the caſe which they deſire. Now, it may the queſtion of
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:95016:202"/>ſome ſuch perſon, what is beſt to be done in the caſe, Whether it be better and ſafer to Neutralize between theſe two Opinions, and hang in ſuſpenſe, like a Meteor in the air, between Heaven and Earth, or elſe to fall in and cloſe in his Judgment either with the one Opinion, or with the other? To this I reply:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Though there be ſome kind of Opinions and Tenents in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appertaining to Religion, wherein a modeſty and tenderneſs in Judgment do well become the graveſt and beſt-grown Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch, wherein either the Arguments on both ſides have much probability and ſtrength of reaſon, (at leaſt ſeeming ſtrength of reaſon) in them; or elſe where there is little can be produced on either ſide for the ſatisfying of the Judgment, or eviction of the truth: Although (I ſay) in doubts and queſtions of this nature a modeſt tenderneſs of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not unworthy a ſober and ſound Chriſtian; yet an abſolute Scepticiſm, or meer Neutrality of Judgment, in theſe or any other que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, doth not anſwer the ſtate and dignity of a Chriſtian, one who deſires to be thought a man in underſtanding, The Reaſon is, becauſe there are hardly any Poſitions or Opinions, whether truth or error, but have ſomewhat either in themſelves, in their own conſtitution and frame, or elſe in ſome conſideration or other relating to them, and this acceſſible enough, which is ſufficient to found or build ſome lighter eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate (at leaſt) upon their agreement either with errour, or with truth. Now to be ignorant in this caſe, or not apprehenſive of ſuch things, the knowledge of which is proper to encline (at leaſt) the Judgment, and withal may with competent ſearch and conſideration be obtained, is not honourable for him who is eſteemed ſpiritual or skilful in the word of Righteouſneſs. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, Concerning the Queſtion before us, <hi>viz.</hi> about the Deity or Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt, the nature and condition of it is ſuch, that there is no place or poſſibility for a meer Neutrality or ſuſpenſion of Judgment about it: Men and women muſt of neceſſity take either the right hand or the left, and go along with the one Opinion or the other. The reaſon is, becauſe the Queſtion, as well in the Affirmative part of it as in the Negative, relates unto Practice; yea, it relates unto two ſuch Practices which (in the Language of Logicians) are <hi>contraria immediata,</hi> ſuch contraries which admit no <hi>Mediums</hi> between them. He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt, and holds that he is not God, cannot honour him with that honour which is proper unto God only; but at moſt with ſuch a kind of honour which is competent to an excellent Creature: As on the other hand, he that believeth the Holy Ghoſt to be very God, cannot but worſhip him as God, Now it is impoſſible, but that a man or woman muſt either honour the Holy Ghoſt as God, or not as God; for if he judgeth him to be a Creature, or created Spirit, now he doth not honour him as God: If he judgeth him to be
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:95016:202"/>an increated Spirit, and God himſelf, now he honoureth him (at leaſt in this his Judgment of him) as God. So that if a man or woman ſhall think to ſay and hold thus; I will neither judge or think him to be either a finite and created Spirit, on the one hand; nor yet an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite or increated Spirit, on the other hand: This is a kind of inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtency, and it plainly enough ſuppoſeth, that ſuch a perſon doth not judge or think him to be God, and refuſeth, or neglecteth to exhibite divine honour unto him; which, being interpreted, is a denial of his Godhead: So that evident it is, that in the Queſtion about the Holy Ghoſt's being God, there is no place nor poſſibility for a neutrality of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Opinion; but we muſt of neceſſity, at leaſt in our practice or behaviour towards him conclude him either to be God, or not God.</p>
               <p>Well then, this being ſuppoſed, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> it may (haply) be ſome mans que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, The caſe being ſo with us, that we are intangled and perplexed in our Judgments and Conſciences, between the Arguments on the one hand, and the Arguments on the other hand; and are not able clearly to ſatisfie our ſelves, either touching the ſufficiency or inſufficiency of the Scriptures, and other grounds inſiſted on by men of the one Opinion and the other; What is beſt, and ſafeſt, and moſt <hi>Chriſtian</hi> like to be done in ſuch a caſe as this? I reply,</p>
               <p>There being two kinds of Arguments or Reaſons (as Logicians di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them) whereby Poſitions or Tenents are wont to be proved, Artificial and Inartificial; by Artificial, the meaning is, thoſe that are levied and wrought out by the light and ſtrength of the underſtanding from general Principles: By Inartificial, the teſtimony or conſent of Judgment amongſt men about a matter; when a man can make no earnings of the former (thoſe that are Artificial) but theſe on both ſides ſeem to balance the one the other, or (it may be) are demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or ſatisfactory on neither hand; then the beſt and ſafeſt way is to have recourſe unto the latter; the Authority, Teſtimony, or Conſent of Judgment amongſt men, eſpecially men who are moſt competent to be heard and regarded in ſuch caſes. When ſatisfaction (I ſay) cannot be had touching the mind of God, or the true ſenſe and meaning of ſuch and ſuch Texts of Scripture, which are wont to be inſiſted on for the proof of ſuch or ſuch a Doctrine, or Tenent, one or more, neither from other Scriptures, nor yet from any clear or undoubted Principle in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; The ſafeſt courſe in this caſe, eſpecially where there is no place for a Neutrality in Judgment (which we have ſhewed to be the caſe in the Point in hand) is to have recourſe to the ſenſe and Judgment of the Churches of Chriſt in all Ages, or to the Judgments of thoſe whom God hath raiſed up from time to time to be Teachers and Inſtructers of his People. We find that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf did attribute much to the Authority and Judgment of the Churches of Chriſt in ſuch caſes, wherein a clear and ſatisfactory iſſue was hard to come at, either by
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:95016:203"/>Scriptures or Argument otherwiſe. As in the Queſtion about mens Propheſying with their heads uncovered; <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if any man ſeem contentious we have no ſuch cuſtome, neither the Churches of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. Meaning, that if any perſon remained yet unſatisfied, or unconvinced, touching the meetneſs of ſuch an habit, both for men and women in the Church, during the time of the publick Worſhip of God, whether by Prayer or by Propheſying, as he had now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto them, and pleaded for; but would ſtill pretend diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and contradict, and be contentious; ſuch ought to know and conſider (for their ſatisfaction) that neither they (the Apoſtles) nor yet the Churches of God, far or near, had, in the caſe mentioned, any ſuch cuſtome, which was contrary unto, and differing from that which now they had commended unto them. So the great Prophet <hi>David,</hi> long before, judged it an abſurdity, a thing unworthy of him, to act any thing wherein he ſhould offend againſt, or condemn the generation of the Righteous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.15. meaning, the generality of Saints, or perſons fearing God. So that the Authority, Teſtimony, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of Chriſtians, in their ſeveral Generations, in matters concerning their Profeſſion and Religion, ought to be (and alwaies hath been amongſt the beſt and ſoundeſt Chriſtians) of very great eſteem, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when matters in queſtion between themſelves could not be cleared, iſſued, or determined otherwiſe. And they that in ſuch caſes would not be ſatisfied herewith, were ſtill looked upon by ſober Chriſtians as men of proud turbulent and unpeaceable ſpirits, according to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an ancient Writer. <hi>Contra rationem, nemo ſobrius; Contra Scripturas, nemo Chriſtianus; Contra Eccleſiam, nemo pacificus.</hi>

               <p>Now then for the ſwaying and ordering of our Judgments in the Queſtion in hand, in caſe we be at a loſs, or at a ſtand, in reſpect of all artificial Arguments and Proofs from the Scriptures; certainly the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Chriſtian Churches, and of the learned Teachers thereof, in all Ages, is of the moſt and ſafeſt concernment unto us. What their ſenſe in the caſe, more generally is, and from the Apoſtles time hath been, we ſhall ſhew preſently.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> Suppoſe this to be the caſe, that we are travelling in a Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; we come where there is a diverſity of waies, one on this hand, another on that hand, and being ſtrangers in the Country, we know not which of the two waies leads to the place whither we are going; only we are certainly informed, that many ſober and underſtanding
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:95016:203"/>perſons, who have travelled to the ſame place whither we are going, and were careful in their Journey to find out the right way, went that way (for example) which lieth on the right hand; and that very few, and theſe little conſiderable otherwiſe, went the other way that lieth on the left hand: Is it not then much more reaſonable, that, in this uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, we ſhould take that way which hath been moſt occupied and beaten by the feet of ſo many diſcreet and wary Travellers; who we have the greateſt grounds of confidence to believe are ſafely arrived at the place whither they intended their Journey, and we intend ours alſo, than to adventure our ſelves in the other way, concerning which we know not whether ever any perſon travelling in it came in peace to his Journeys end? This is the caſe between the two Opinions before us, that which denieth the Holy Ghoſt to be God, the ſame God in Eſſence or Subſtance with the Father; and that which confeſſeth or believeth him to be God equal with the Father. Now then, there is on the right hand way thoſe who ſay that the Holy Ghoſt is God, the moſt high God: And there are on the left hand thoſe alſo who deny him to be the moſt High God. But thoſe that went on the right hand way were the generality of Chriſtians, which were moſt ſober, and moſt learned, and fulleſt of Piety and Zeal, who believed the Holy Ghoſt to be God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, one and the ſame God with the Father; and concerning theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the generality of ancient Fathers, and Chriſtian Martyrs of old, and Confeſſours in the Primitive times, and the great body of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans taught and inſtructed by them, we have the greateſt aſſurance that lightly can be that theſe are ſafely arrived at the place whereunto they travelled, which is the Kingdom of Heaven: Whereas concerning thoſe who have gone the other way, which ſaith the Holy Ghoſt is not God, but a created and finite Spirit, as they are very inconſiderable (as I ſaid) being compared with thoſe that have gone the other way, ſo were they (<hi>viz.</hi> the greateſt number of thoſe few) the greateſt Perſecutors that ever the Chriſtian Churches met withal. For it is generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the <hi>Arian</hi> Perſecution was the greateſt that ever was, and that it roſe from out of them: And for the courſe of their lives, they are not therein comparable to the generality of thoſe that are gone the other way. So that in ſuch a caſe as this, it is eaſie to determine what is beſt becoming Chriſtians to do if they ſhould be ſtrangers to both the Opinions. If they do not know but that the one may be as good as the other, yet inaſmuch as the generality, and beſt ſort of Travellers, thoſe who are of the beſt credit, and moſt judicious have gone that way which we are contending for, it is moſt ſafe, and moſt acceptable in the eyes of God (who loveth that men ſhould act according to Principles of Reaſon) for men in their judgment to go along with ſuch. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, after a conſciencious ſearch and enquiry about the truth, in any matter of queſtion in Chriſtian Religion, if we cannot come by the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:95016:204"/>light of any Argument, from the Scriptures, to ſatisfie our ſelves touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth therein, God himſelf doth ſend us for our reſolution to the footſteps of the Flock, and to the Shepherds Tents; I mean, to the Authority and Judgment of the Churches of Chriſt in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> Though God in his Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.2. prohibiteth men to follow <hi>a multitude to do evil,</hi> what multitude ſoever it be, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to joyn with a multitude in receiving or taking up an Error; yet of the two, it is better (I mean, it is far the leſſer ſin, and leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking in the ſight of God) to follow a multitude of grave, wiſe, and conſciencious perſons, upon the terms ſpecified, though it be (as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of iſſue and event) to take up an erroneous Perſwaſion, or Opinion, than it is to forſake ſuch a multitude, as we ſpeak, of grave, wiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though a man ſhould peradventure embrace the truth: it is more ſafe for a man to take up an error with ſuch a Multitude than to go alone, or with ſome few or inconſiderate or inconſiderable ones only.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe it is much more reaſonable to expect the truth amongſt a multitude of grave, ſober, and conſciencious perſons, who are ſtudious of the truth, than to expect it amongſt a few inconſiderable perſons (comparatively) concerning whoſe integrity, or unfeigned love to the truth there is much more doubt and queſtion. Now this alſo is the caſe before us; The Fathers generally, of greateſt eſteem in this Generation for Piety, Holineſs, Learning, and Faithfulneſs in the Work of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel; and conſequently, we may conclude, the generality of Chriſtians, who were taught by them; and ſo the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and Confeſſors, in the pureſt times of the Church, were of this opinion and belief, that the Holy Ghoſt was an Increated Spirit, and truly God. I might detain you many hours, yea, many daies, in preſenting you with paſſages and ſayings of this nature; I ſhall inſiſt upon ſome few only for the preſent. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is known to be a moſt ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diligent enquirer into that Faith (I mean, thoſe Doctrines and Tenents) which had been generally held and maintained in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches a long time before, and from the Apoſtles daies till his time, and to have had means and opportunity to attain to a perfect knowledge of this Faith; and withal is known to have been <hi>defenſor acerrimus,</hi> a moſt zealous defender of it. He then, in his Firſt Book <hi>de Trinit. Cap.</hi> 6. having occaſion to mention that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. And reading the words thus, <hi>For of him, and through him, and in him are all things, to whom be glory for ever;</hi> He gloſſeth them thus: <hi>Ex ipſo,</hi> i. e. <hi>ex Patre; per ipſum,</hi> i.e. <hi>per Filium; in ipſo,</hi> i.e. <hi>in Spiritu Sancto; manifeſtum quod Pater, Filius, &amp; Spiritus Sanctus unus Deus eſt, quando ſingulariter intulit, Ipſi gloria in ſacula ſaeculorum.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Athanaſius</hi> lived well nigh an hundred years before <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and he in that Symbol or Creed (which beareth his name) is ſo punctual and preciſe in this buſineſs, touching the Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt, that, having aſſerted it, he uſeth theſe words: This, ſaith he, is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith, which except a man believe undoubtedly he cannot be ſaved; ſo that he was quite contrary to that Spirit which now ſtandeth up againſt the Godhead of the Holy Ghoſt; yea, theſe very Fathers, <hi>Ignatius, Juſtin Martyr, Jerome, Tertullian, Lactantius, Hilary,</hi> &amp;c. whom our Adverſaries profeſs to ſtand by them as if if they ſpake on their ſide, and againſt the Deity of the Holy Ghoſt; when, the very truth is, they are ſo expreſs, and ſo ſignificant to the contrary, that I cannot but account it a little ſtrange that ſuch a claim (though I believe it is not without much regret) ſhould be laid unto them. But our Adverſaries (perhaps) taking ſome words from theſe Fathers, wherein they do not ſo fully declare themſelves, as having declared themſelves elſewhere, and not minding, or at leaſt not well heeding their fuller explication of themſelves; they will needs bear men in hand that they were of their Opinion. <hi>Ignatius</hi> was the moſt ancient of them all; in a Religious Epiſtle written to the Chriſtians in <hi>Antioch,</hi> his words are theſe,<note place="margin">

Now, for the moſt part, they that deny the Deity and Divinity of Chriſt, they do the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Holy Ghoſt. But they who deſire farther ſatisfaction in this kind, and to know the full, clear, and unqueſtionable Judgment of the ancient Doctors and Churches from the Apoſtles times may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much trouble ſatisfie themſelves; for there are many learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that have taken pains herein.</p>
               <p>If it be objected; But is it not a thing of dangerous conſequence, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> and no leſs than horrid Idolatry, a thing which God will ſeverely puniſh, to give the glory of his Godhead unto an another, unto any Creature
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:95016:205"/>of his; or to introduce a plurality of Gods into the World? Therefore had not men need to conſider narrowly, and to bethink themſelves over and over how they give up their Judgments and Conſciences to ſuch an opinion which maketh the Holy Ghoſt to be truly God? I reply:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That as it is a dangerous conſequence, and no leſs than horrid Idolatry to give the glory of the Godhead of him who is God indeed, the true God, unto another, unto any Creature, in which reſpect men and women had need be careful, above all care, that their feet be not taken in ſuch a ſnare; ſo on the other hand it is altogether as dangerous, and Idolatry of as vile a nature, and threatning conſequence, not to acknowledge and reverence him as God, who is God indeed. And in this reſpect men and women had need be abundantly ſolicitous and cautious how they entertain and admit of that Doctrine which denieth the Holy Ghoſt to be God. For in caſe it ſhall prove that he is God, all they who ſhall deny him to be God will be found fighters againſt God, which will be worſe than ſimple Idolatry, and a ſin as threatning, and of as dangerous a conſequence as the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Not to acknowledge, not to glorifie God as God, or as himſelf: eſpecially as he hath revealed himſelf in his Word, is, if not plain and expreſs Idolatry, yet a very high miſdemeanour againſt God; therefore, in caſe God hath revealed himſelf in his Word to be Three in One, and One in Three, which is, and hath been the ſenſe, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, (ſome few perſons only excepted inconſiderable both in their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and otherwiſe comparatively) of the whole Chriſtian World, Fathers, Martyrs, Confeſſors, Paſtors, Teachers, Bodies of Chriſtian Churches, ever ſince the Apoſtles daies (as was lately ſhewed.) They who do not thus acknowledge, worſhip, and glorifie him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently do not acknowledge and own him as God, contract the guilt, and expoſe themſelves to the puniſhment of ſuch a Crime. Therefore men and women had need take heed how they reject or deny the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Holy Ghoſt, leſt by ſo doing they make a God unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, according to their own fanſie, and worſhip him after their own imaginations.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> It is the firſt-born of improbabilities, or things that are unlikely that the Church of Chriſt, which (as the Apoſtle ſtyleth it) is, <hi>The Houſe of the living God,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The pillar and ground or ſtay of truth,</hi> in the midſt whereof Jeſus Chriſt himſelf delights to be continually walking and making himſelf known, ſhould ever ſince the Apoſtles times now for 1600 years and upwards lie wallowing in the horrid pollutions of ſo foul and groſs an Error, as to judge him who is a Creature to be God. Can any man (lightly) be ſo ſimple, as to think or imagine a ſnuff of a Candle to be the Sun? And is there not a far greater difference between the ever bleſſed and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:95016:205"/>incomprehenſible God, and any Creature of the greateſt perfection that is imaginable, than there is between the ſnuff of a Candle and the Sun? Or is it worthy the belief or thoughts of any ſober Chriſtian, that Jeſus Chriſt, for ſo many hundred of years together, ſhould not have awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Beloved out of ſuch a Lethargy, or ſleep of death as was fallen upon her whileſt ſhe ſaid, in effect, to a Stock, thou art my Maker, and to a Stone, thou art my Redeemer? Or what is it leſs, or leſs unworthy than this, to ſay unto a Creature, thou art my God? They who have but any tolerable thoughts of Jeſus Chriſt his love and care over his Church, cannot have ſuch hard thoughts of him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Nor can it reaſonably be imagined, that the Holy Ghoſt would have received with ſo much patience, and with ſo much ſilence, nay, with ſo much acceptation, from the hand of the Chriſtian World, the acknowledgements of a Deity, had he not been conſcious to himſelf that they were his due, and that he neither did either God the Father, or the Son, the leaſt injury or wrong, in receiving them at the hands of men: But were he not, or had he not been God, he had treſpaſſed after a very provoking and high manner againſt him, who is God indeed, in accepting his appropriate Royalties, and ſuffering himſelf to be admired and adored amongſt the Churches as God. Doubtleſs, the ſin of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any acclamation from men, or any thing elſe which is appropriate unto God alone, is a ſin of a very exaſperating nature. As it was with <hi>Herod,</hi> who was ſtruck with an Angel, <hi>Acts</hi> 12.22. And we read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. &amp; 22.9. when <hi>John</hi> made a tender of Divine Worſhip to the Angel, though he did not call him by the name of God, yet when he did but exhibite that which was appropriate unto God, the Angel would not ſuffer him, nor admit it: The Angel ſeemed to be exceeding tender and jealous of receiving ſo much as the hint, or the firſt fruits of divine honour. <hi>John</hi> thought that he that had revealed unto him ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Myſteries was worthy of all honour; therefore rather than not to ſhew himſelf thankful and reſpectful unto him for that unſpeakable kindneſs of the Revelation, he would needs give him ſomething; and having nothing at hand to repuite this high courteſie from the Angel, that revealed ſuch hidden myſteries to him, but Divine Worſhip and honour, he would beſtow that upon him; but the Angel would by no means ſuffer him to do it. The truth is, our Adverſaries themſelves at this turn do not make much ſcruple of this, namely, that Divine Honour ſhould be given both to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt, and that they may, and ought of duty to accept it; though in the mean time they do deny the Godhead both of the One and of the Other: But into the ſecrets of ſuch a Notion my ſoul knoweth not the way how to enter; nor can I comprehend or underſtand how they can either make Reaſon or truth of ſuch a conceit to deny the Perſons to be God by Nature, and yet notwithſtanding to judge it lawful and meet that Divine Honour
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:95016:206"/>ſhould be exhibited and tendered unto them. Upon what ground they can ſatisfie themſelves in bringing together this Eaſt and Weſt, their ſtrange opinion on the one hand; and their practice, which ſeemeth to affront it on the other hand: How they can make peace between two that are at ſo great an enmity and diſtance between themſelves I am not able to comprehend; unleſs they mean by Divine Worſhip only ſomething that is more Sacred or more Auguſt than the Reverence that is due unto man. Bat this will not however ſalve the Opinion though it be formed and put into never ſo artificial and handſome terms: Yea, though it might be ſalved with ſuch a ſenſe and interpretation put upon it, yet it is not worthy a Chriſtian, and eſpecially a Teacher of others, to put the mind of God, or any Notion of Truth into ambiguous terms, which need more unfolding than needs muſt; for it is good to cloath the Truth in ſuch a manner that it may be moſt familiar and neareſt at hand to be received by the Judgments and Underſtandings of men. But to the buſineſs in hand. May the greateſt Subject in a Kingdom lawfully go up into his Sovereigns Bed, or require of his fellow Subjects that they ſwear Loyalty and Homage unto him as unto their Sovereign? Or doth not the Scriptures from place to place make it Fornication, Whoredom, Adultery, when that Worſhip which is appropriately due unto God is given unto any other?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> We know that the ſin of Idolatry is from place to place in the Scripture expreſly numbred amongſt thoſe high provocations and miſdemeanours which abſolutely and peremptorily exclude from the Kingdom of God, and from Salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21 8. So that they who deny the Holy Ghoſt to be God, do hereby, Firſt, Make the whole Chriſtian World (in a manner, or comparatively, as hath been ſaid) Fathers, Martyrs, Confeſſors and whole Chriſtian Churches to be Idolaters. Secondly, By a Scripture conſequence (pregnant and undeniable) they do adjudge them all to the vengeance of hell fire. But it is a ſmall thing, with perſons of a proud and peremptory ſpirit, to ſacrifice not only the names, honour, and reputations of the worthieſt men under heaven, but even their ſouls and ſalvation alſo, upon the ſervice of their own opinions and conceits. The Lord Chriſt himſelf muſt be a Samaritan, and have a Devil, that the Scribes and Phariſees may be preſumed to be in the truth: And ſo holy and worthy men who above all the World beſides have had moſt acquaintance with God, <hi>Ignatius, Juſtin Martyr, Ireneus, Epiphanius, Baſil, Nazianzen, Chryſoſtome, Jerome, Auſtin,</hi> and who not, of all thoſe great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous lights of the Chriſtian World in their daies, muſt be all <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and ſent down into Hell, that a Crown of glory may be ſet upon the head of a fond Opinion, little leſs, or rather not at all leſs than Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and to make way that they who deny the Godhead of the Spirit may be ſaved. For though it be hard peremptorily to deny a
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:95016:206"/>poſſibility of ſalvation unto perſons of both opinions, whoſe waies other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are worthy the Goſpel and Profeſſion thereof, yet the truth is, that partly the nature, and partly the conſequence of the two Opinions, compared together, their diſtance being ſo great as it is, and they ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary one unto the other; it is not a matter of eaſie conception how they both ſhould be ſaved, unleſs with the men againſt whom we now argue, and have under reproof, who are (in this reſpect) the off-ſpring of the old Hereticks called the <hi>Origenlans,</hi> who hold that after a certain time, all men without exception, as well bad as good, ſhall be ſaved: yea, the very truth is, that the entire Syſteme and body of that Religion and Doctrine (ſome few, common, and general Principles only excepted, and theſe alſo corruptly underſtood) which the men we now ſpeak of own, is ſcarce any thing elſe but a Rapſody or Fardle of old abhorrid Errors and Hereſies of the Anthropomorphits, Arians, Macedonians, Origeniſts, with ſeveral others, who were the greateſt troublers of the Goſpel in the courſe of it, and Enemies and Oppoſers of the Truth in their times.</p>
               <p>Sixthly (and laſtly) All the premiſed particulars duly weighed, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> and conſidered, methinks any ſober and conſidering Chriſtian ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and ſtand up every whit as much for his ſatisfaction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in this opinion, that the Holy Ghoſt is but a meer Creature, and to bring over his Judgment thereunto as the Jews did to perſwade them that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Son of God, who (as our Saviour himſelf told the Nobleman at <hi>Capernaum, Joh.</hi> 4.48.) were at ſuch a diſtance from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it, that <hi>exept they ſaw ſigns and wonders, they would not believe;</hi> they were reſolved not to believe it upon any inferiour or lower account. In like manner, conſidering what the Scriptures ſpeak in way of oppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and how matters have gone all along from Age to Age in the Chriſtian Churches, in reference to this Doctrine and Opinion (that the Holy Ghoſt is a Creature, and not God.) It is ſtrange to me, that any ſober or well adviſed perſons, profeſſing Chriſtianity, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain it upon terms of any weak or leſs convincing demonſtration than of Miracles, and Signs, and Wonders, or of the Teſtimony of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from heaven to aſſert it; and therefore they that do ſubject unto it are of that Generation of men which the Wiſeman ſpeaketh of, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.15. They are of the Houſe and Linage of that ſimple man who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every thing, any thing, let the nature of it be never ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent, and the connexion between things never ſo looſe and groundleſs. I had not inſiſted upon this branch of our Uſe of Reproof ſo largely, but that the delinquent ſpirit is ſo rampant in the World, and buſily acting his part near unto us, and amongſt us; and the Apoſtles directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>Titus</hi> is, (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9, 10.) That a Biſhop or Paſtor of a Church <hi>ſhould hold faſt the faithful Word as he hath been taught</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> by the Apoſtles) <hi>that he may be able by ſound Doctrine to exhort and convince
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:95016:207"/>the gain-ſayer, for there are many unruly and vain talkers, eſpecially they of the Circumciſion, whoſe mouths muſt be ſtopped:</hi> There are men, and ſtill have been, whoſe mouths muſt be ſtopped; but not as ſome would interpret it, by Priſons, or by Sword: No, but ſtopped they muſt be, <hi>i. e.</hi> way-laid in their Judgments, Conſciences, and Underſtandings by the Scriptures. This is that which the Apoſtle requireth in a <hi>Biſhop, that he may be able by ſound Doctrine, both to exhort and convince.</hi> And by the way, take notice of this, that he muſt exhort by ſound Doctrine; the truth is, that many Biſhops in the World do exhort many times very ſoundly, but not by ſound Doctrine. For their Doctrine ſtandeth at Weſt, and their Exhortation ſtandeth South. Now a faithful <hi>Biſhop,</hi> every man in that Office and Place, muſt exhort with ſound Doctrine; his Exhortation muſt be comportant with the ſpirit, and ſoul, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of his Doctrine, the one muſt not be a <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and the other a <hi>Jew.</hi> But this by the way. I ſhall leave this ſort of Offenders at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, only with reminding them of that paſſage of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall break one of the leaſt of theſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſhall teach men ſo, he ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdom of heaven.</hi> My Brethren, to break any of the leaſt of the Commands of Chriſt knowingly, when a man doth underſtand and is convinced that it is the Command of Chriſt, is a ſin of high provocation unto God; but eſpecially to teach men ſo to do, <hi>i. e.</hi> to teach ſuch a Doctrine which may ſtrengthen any mans hand to deſpiſe, neglect, and diſregard any Commandment of Chriſt; this is provoking in the ſight of God, and that in the higheſt, and of ſuch a demerit, that ſuch a man deſerves no place in the Kingdom of God. Therefore whoſoever they be who ſhall firſt weaken their own hands before they weaken anothers; they that teach themſelves to break the Commands of God, and then ſhall ſpread abroad ſuch Opinions and Notions that ſhall animate and encourage men ſo to do, they ſhall be leaſt in the Kingdom of God, they ſhall have no reſpect there, they ſhall not be numbred amongſt the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt: therefore ſuch perſons as theſe, who bring in, and ſet on foot any ſuch Doctrine which doth break and quench the endeavours of the ſpirit of men from following any piece or ſtrain of that heavenly Counſel which the Holy Ghoſt hath given unto men, certainly they fall under this heavy Sentence and Cenſure of Jeſus Chriſt, to be leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

XIV.</hi> A third ſort of Offenders reproved are ſuch who, inſtead of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Exhortation of being filled with the Spirit, take a courſe to be emptied of the Spirit of God: Who make it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Conſcience to turn their backs upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel (which is called the Miniſtry of the Spirit.) Wherein the ſeveral Scriptures and Reaſons by which they ſtrengthen themſelves, in their evil way, are examined, and found bent againſt them. And likewiſe the neceſſity of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and the great benefit thereof, largely aſſerted, and vindicated.</head>
               <p>A Third ſort of Offenders to be reproved upon the former general account, <hi>viz.</hi> as Enemies to that ſubjection, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> and obſervation which ought to be given to the Apoſtles Exhortation of being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> are ſuch who take a courſe rather to be emptied of the Spirit of God than to be filled with him (and of loſing all that preſence and Communion with the Spirit, which ſometimes they had received, and yet may partake of to ſome degree) and that by falling upon ſuch practices, and engaging in ſuch courſes which are of a direct tendency to diſpoſſeſs them of all Communion with him, and to make an abſolute ſeparation of the Spirit of God from them. Theſe are of two ſorts:</p>
               <p>The firſt are thoſe who make it matter of Conſcience to turn their backs upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, which (as the Apoſtle calleth it) is the Miniſtration of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They, who though they do not make it matter of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to neglect or deſpiſe this Miniſtry, yet make it no matter of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience diligently to attend upon it, when they know otherwiſe how to beſtow their time, whether in the purſuit of their pleaſures, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, or in the ſervice of <hi>Mammon,</hi> and attending upon the World: between theſe we might inſert a third ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch, who though they have not turned their backs upon the Miniſtry and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, but ſeem to make it ſome matter of Conſcience to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon it, yet have itching ears, and cannot long together endure wholſome and ſound Doctrine, but run from Mountain to Hill, from one Miniſter to another.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, We all know that of late years there is a ſtrange ſpirit of Error and Ungodlineſs gone out into the World, and walks up and
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:95016:208"/>down the Streets of your City, and hath taken the heads (or hearts rather) of many, who ſometimes greatly loved (or at leaſt) ſeemed thus to love) the Aſſemblies of the Saints, and thoſe diſcoveries of himſelf which God is wont by his Word, and the Miniſtry thereof, to make from day to day unto them. The Spirit we now ſpeak of is a Spirit which teacheth men to ſay, that the Tabernacles of the Lord of Hoſts are vile; and for the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and the opening the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries thereof by thoſe that have an Anointing from heaven to do it, Wherein is it to be eſteemed? This Spirit alſo reacheth, and perſwadeth thoſe men to fortifie, and ſtrengthen, or harden themſelves in their way, not only by Reaſons and Arguments, ſuch as they are, but by the Scriptures themſelves alſo, as if they were divided in themſelves, and deſtroyed with one hand what they build up with the other. Do not men who ſuffer themſelves to be lead by this ſuperordinancing Spirit, rather conſult the emptying of themſelves of the Spirit of God than their filling with him, and take a courſe by degrees wholly to bereave and diſpoſſeſs themſelves of that preſence of his in them, which at preſent they do enjoy, or have enjoyed formerly? <hi>Where no wood is</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) or (as the Hebrew hath it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.20.) without wood, <hi>the fire goeth out:</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, except the Spirit of God in men be fed and nouriſhed with the freſh and new comings in of the light of the knowledge of God, and of Chriſt, his preſence will languiſh, and ſink, and die in a manner. Hence it is, that the Apoſtle, having admoniſhed the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> not to <hi>quench the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. He immediately ſubjoyneth, by way of caution (<hi>ver.</hi> 20.) and preſignification how they might, and muſt prevent it; <hi>Deſpiſe not Propheſying,</hi> [or as our laſt Tranſlation with more agreeableneſs to the Original rendreth it] <hi>Deſpiſe not Propheſyings</hi> (in the plural number); Propheſyings, <hi>i.e.</hi> the opening and interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of God by a proper gift of the Spirit for the work; if this be deſpiſed, <hi>i. e.</hi> made nothing of (as the word ſignifieth) then the Spirit in men and women will be <hi>quenched, i. e.</hi> the vigour and activeneſs of his preſence in men will abate, and if the neglect and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem be long continued in, will by degrees wholly ceaſe. The word <hi>Propheſyings,</hi> in the Plural number ſeems to imply, that not only, or ſimply, to deſpiſe Propheſying, [<hi>i. e.</hi> the Work or Ordinance it ſelf in the general of Preaching, or opening the Scriptures] is the ready way to quench the Spirit, but to deſpiſe the frequency of the opportunities vouchſafed by God in that kind, <hi>viz.</hi> when the bountiful provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God affordeth unto men and women frequent oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of attending upon the Spirit of God in the exerciſe of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyings; and when they may be diligence and wiſe ordering and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their ſecular and worldly occaſions, without any conſiderable inconveniency, frequently attend the openings of the mouth of God which we ſpake of; and yet they ſhall frequently neglect to do it, pleaſing
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:95016:208"/>themſelves with a conceipt that to attend on Propheſying, on the Lord's day only is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>If the perſons with whom we have to do in the reproof in hand, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> ſhould ask me, But why ſhould the deſpiſing or neglecting of Propheſying, or of the Miniſtry of the Word, be the quenching of the Spirit, or a way to empty us of the Spirit? I reply,</p>
               <p>Firſt, Suppoſe we could give no other reaſon of the thing, now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, but only the Will and pleaſure of God, and could ſay no more in the caſe but this, that it is the Counſel of the Will of God to make the attendance of the Creature man upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, where he vouchſafeth it, the condition of the Spirits preſence or abiding with him; ſo that in caſe he doth neglect it, his Spirit ſhall withdraw from him: If there were nothing elſe but this, Were not this enough to ſatisfie any man of Conſcience? But now the truth is, that the reaſons of this Counſel of the Will of God, that the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel ſhould be a ſtanding means to preſerve and maintain the preſence of the Spirit of God; the reaſons (I ſay) are not ſo hard to come at in this caſe, but that if the Minds, Judgments, and Underſtandings of men were impartially engaged in the enquiry after what the Scriptures ſpeak, as to matters of this nature, they might be clearly diſcerned. The reaſons therefore, why God hath made ſuch a Connexion, between the attending upon the Miniſtry of the Word, and the preſence of his Spirit, are, firſt, becauſe the word of God is (as it were) the materials or proper matter for the Holy Ghoſt to work on: to work all his excellent and heavenly works in the hearts and ſouls of men: As for example, to work Faith, Peace, Joy, and Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs, and Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Holy Ghoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth all theſe excellent works in the hearts of men by the truths of God in the Goſpel. As an Artificer worketh upon his materials, and by his Art and Skil produceth his Artificial piece, as a Carpenter upon his Timber, or a Goldſmith upon his Metal; ſo that if you do not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with theſe materials they can do nothing. As the Carpenter cannot work when he hath no Timber; the Holy Ghoſt, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if there be no Viſion, no Truth, no New Light coming in for him to work on, he will take no pleaſure nor delight to inhabit or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue there. He ſhall (ſaith our Saviour, ſpeaking to his Diſciples of the Holy Ghoſt) <hi>He ſhall receive, or take of mine, and ſhall ſhew it unto you, Joh.</hi> 16.14. What things of his doth our Saviour mean the Holy ſhall take and ſhew? Doubtleſs, they are ſuch things of his, or relating unto him, which are contained and aſſerted in the Goſpel: As his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, Humane Nature, his Incarnation, Conception, Birth, Holineſs of Life, Miracles, Death, Reſurrection, aſcenſion, with all the Ends, and great Purpoſes and Intentions of God in this whole Diſpenſation of him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now our Saviours meaning is, that the Holy
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:95016:209"/>Ghoſt ſhould take all theſe, and ſhew them unto them, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſhould declare, open, and interpret them unto them; and cauſe them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and conſider the weight, worth, and beneficial tendencies of them unto men and women. And indeed this is the proper work of the Holy Ghoſt to ſhew unto men and women the things that are Jeſus Chriſt's, and to cauſe them to underſtand them, to draw out the hearts and Judgments of men, and raiſe in them holy Purpoſes and Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and ſo likewiſe, to draw out from them holy Practices and Actions (for this is the gracious and heavenly work of the Holy Ghoſt too), ſo that where he is not furniſhed with theſe things of Jeſus Chriſt, where he hath no opportunity of ſhewing theſe things unto men he hath little to do; he taketh no pleaſure to abide there: as Artificers or Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men care not to be, or dwell in ſuch places where their proper materials are either ſcarce, or not at all to be had.</p>
               <p>If it be here ſaid, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> But the Holy Ghoſt needs not to be furniſhed by the Miniſtry of the Goſpel with there things, becauſe he hath the perfect knowledge of all theſe things, of, and in himſelf, and ſo can take and bring them forth out of his own Treaſury and ſhew them unto men, or elſe he can take out of the Writings themſelves, out of the Records of the Goſpel, and ſhew them unto men in private; he knoweth how to have the things of Jeſus Chriſt at another hand than at the Miniſters of the Goſpel; ſo that there ſeems to be no neceſſity of mens waiting and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. To this I reply:</p>
               <p>Firſt, By way of Conceſſion; It is true, if we ſpeak of his abſolute power, he is able to do either the one or the other; either to take the things of Chriſt out of his own Treaſury, and bring them forth and ſhew them unto men; or elſe he can take the Letter of the Goſpel, and teach them, and hereby make diſcoveries of Jeſus Chriſt, and draw out mens hearts by means of it. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly (I reply further, by way of Exception) It is one thing what God, and ſo what the Holy Ghoſt is able to do, by the abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unlimitedneſs of his power; and another thing, what he judgeth agreeable to his Wiſdom, and the other Attributes of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Being. The Rule of Gods Will, or what he doth, or purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to do, is not his power (at leaſt his power alone) but his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom principally, and then his Goodneſs, and Righteouſneſs, and all his other Attributes. He doth not do, nor intend to do the thouſandth part of what he is able by his power, abſolutely and apart conſidered, to do, but only what in wiſdom he judgeth meet and convenient for him to do. Now then, the Wiſdom of God hath judged it meet (and the meetneſs of the thing in it ſelf is diſcernable enough by the minds and reaſons of men, if they were impartially, and narrowly engaged in the conſideration of it; that men who deſire the gracious preſence and aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, in ſhewing, opening, interpreting, and
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:95016:209"/>applying the things of Jeſus Chriſt unto them ſhall receive the things themſelves from ſuch Perſons, and by ſuch Meſſengers who are fit for ſuch a purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to build them up in grace, and make them meet for glory. It would occaſion too large a digreſſion (and perhaps un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable) to enter upon a thorough demonſtration of the Wiſdom of God, in ordering the Contents of the Goſpel, the things of Jeſus Chriſt, to be communicated and imparted unto the generality of men, by men like unto themſelves, not by the immediate and ſole interpoſure and acting of the Holy Ghoſt, nor yet of the written Records of the Goſpel it ſelf, and therefore we ſhall forbear it; only theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in reference to the buſineſs are near at hand.</p>
               <p>Firſt, By the courſe we ſpeak of, God multiplies the dependencies of men upon himſelf, which is a kindly and proper nurture to train them up in humility, As he doth alſo by multiplying their dependencies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf in ſo many means for the preſervation of their healths and lives, and well-being in the World, as he hath made requiſite hereunto; as by impoſing on them a neceſſity to eat and drink, and conſequently, to make uſe of the skill, and labour, and faithfulneſs of thoſe who muſt prepare theſe neceſſaries for them; and ſo upon the earth which muſt yield the matter whereof their meat and drink muſt be made. And ſo upon the ſeaſons and temperature of the year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Look how many Creatures and means we are debtors unto, or dependent upon, for our health, and ſtrength, and well-being in the World, our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo much the more ſervile and encumbred; and conſequently, is juſt matter of a proportionable humility unto us; for if any of theſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſhould miſcarry in that which is proper for them to do, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards the life, health, and preſervation of men, then are they in danger of trouble, ſickneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the proper tendencies of theſe things are apt to humble the proud hearts of men and women, and to keep low and underfoot their haughtineſs: and they that do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it, do not underſtand the deſign of God, nor are they acquainted with his mind herein. For (as the Scriptures ſpeak) <hi>The Borrower is Servant to the Lender,</hi> Prov. 22.7. For men and women then to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row things from ſuch poor Creatures, and to go to this Servant, and that Servant; and to this Trade, and to that Trade; this ſheweth that our life is very ſervile, and as it is the ſaying, That he that hath the greateſt body is the faireſt mark to ſhoot at: So he that hath the greateſt number of helpers, and multiplicity of dependencies to maintain and make good his comfort and well-being, this man certainly is expoſed ſo much the more to miſcarry, and to be interrupted in his comforts. Therefore when God intends to perfect the ſtate and condition of man, and to exalt him unto the higheſt felicity and pitch of bleſſedneſs of which he is capable, he will diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>umber his eſtate and condition from all, and all manner of dependencies whatſoever, as far as is poſſible,
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:95016:210"/>and make him like unto him, as is poſſible for a Creature to be made in his independency, <hi>i. e.</hi> he will make him dependent only and ſolely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, according to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. (which we have heretofore I remember upon occaſion opened more at large unto you) that when Chriſt hath delivered up his Kingdom unto his Father, then God ſhall be all in all. God doth now veil or cover himſelf, he is now in meats and in drinks, in cloaths, in ſleep, in every thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is any influence or bleſſing; But then he ſhall be all in all, that is, there ſhall be nothing in meats and drinks, nothing in this Creature, nothing in that Creature, no: but he will (as it were) contract, and withdraw life out of all theſe, and he will give out and utter himſelf intirely in and by himſelf only: He will be the life, and joy, and bleſſedneſs; his infinite fulneſs ſhall be the felicity of his Creature. So that this is one reaſon, why it is agreeable to the Wiſdom of God to put men upon it, that they ſhould depend upon ſuch perſons as he ſhall have prepared for them from time to time to furniſh them with the knowledge of his Will: and (indeed) the very Method and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Goſpel is ſuch, that if things be narrowly viewed, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and conſidered by men, they cannot but perceive that God hath made the Goſpel, and put it into ſuch Phraſes that the things of it ſhould not be underſtood but by the interpoſure of ſome ſuch perſon whom he ſhall raiſe up, and inveſt with abilities to be (according to that of <hi>Job,</hi> Job 33.23. an <hi>Interpreter one among a thouſand.</hi> Now it is an eaſie matter to find difference between men: Thoſe men who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Preachers, and thoſe who are Preachers indeed; for Miniſters there be many, and Preachers many, but there are but few who are Teachers indeed. We may ſee, by the very Inditing of the Scriptures in ſuch words and Phraſes, wherein they are conveyed unto us, that the ſtate and condition of the generality of men and women conſidered, and their occaſions otherwiſe to lay out the ſtrength of their underſtandings, it is not lightly poſſible that without an Interpreter they ſhould come to underſtand them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> By this courſe, we now ſpeak of, God gives an opportunity to try the Spirits of men in ſeveral kinds:</p>
               <p n="1">1. By miniſtring an opportunity unto thoſe who are endowed with gifts and abilities for the work of the Miniſtry, to ſhew how they will behave themſelves in the exerciſe of the variety of gifts and graces where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are enriched; and how they will manage a Work of ſuch a nature as this of the Miniſtry is, with what care, and faithfulneſs, and labour of mind, and laying out of themſelves for the diſcharging of that truſt that is repoſed in them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To try the people alſo, How they will behave themſelves in their attendance upon this great Ordinance of God; and whether they will ſubmit unto the Counſel, and good Pleaſure of God towards them, in
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:95016:210"/>ſuch a way as this is, by attending diligently upon him, in this appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his, and whether they will be faithful, and careful in their attendance hereupon; And it is a competent trial to the ſpirit of ſome men to be put upon the attending upon (eſpecially with diligence) and a giving reverence unto ſuch an Ordinance of God, which wiſe and prudent men of this World call <hi>fooliſhneſs:</hi> For the Apoſtle (we know) borrowing the Dialect of the thoughts, and ſpeeches of the World, calls it, <hi>The fooliſhneſs of Preaching.</hi> This in the ſecond place.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly, for the preſent) There would be one (or rather ſeveral) Adminiſtrations loſt in the World, if the Holy Ghoſt ſhould furniſh men and women immediately by, or from himſelf, with the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and the things of their Eternal Peace; whereas by ſetting on foot ſuch an Ordinance as that of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, he affords the World a great variety of Adminiſtrations, which as it is a means of much good unto them, ſo doth it tend to the beautifying and adorning the World; and it is a thing marvelouſly declaring the Wiſdom, the manifold Wiſdom of God, that he knows how to furniſh it with ſuch (almoſt) incredible variety in every kind. For inſtance, If we look to the Flowers of the Field, Herbs, Plants, and all kind of Vegetables, what great variety is there amongſt them? Now what doth this but declare the infinite Wiſdom of God, in that he gives ſuch variety of ſhapes, and colours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto them; and withal, hath given men wiſdom and skill how to order them for their good, according to their ſeveral and reſpective Natures and Operations? So if we look into the Sea, What an infinite number and various kinds are there both of great and ſmall Fiſhes? So on the Earth, What great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Creatures are there? And of Fouls in the Air there is the like. Again, If we look into the Firmament, What an infinite number of Stars are there alſo, and that of ſeveral Magnitudes? And in all theſe Creatures, What various Natures, Motions, Colours, and Properties are there amongſt them? So likewiſe; in the great buſineſs of Salvation, God, by erecting a Miniſtry amongſt men, and putting them upon it, to have recourſe unto this Ordinance to come by the knowledge of the things of their eternal peace, doth (as it were) beautifie the World in this great Ordinance of Preaching the Goſpel, with many diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein there are many ſtrains of his Wiſdom to be ſeen, which if any one of theſe ſhould be wanting, or miſſing, it would occaſion an <hi>Hiatus,</hi> or empty place in the Diſpenſations of God. And as one compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the taking away the Miniſtry of the Goſpel out of the World unto the taking the Sun out of the Firmament of Heaven, which would cauſe a vacuity or emptineſs, in reſpect of light, and conſequently ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole Creation of God leſs lovely or deſirable: In like manner, the taking away of this Ordinance of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel would cauſe a great darkneſs, in reſpect of all other the Diſpenſations of God
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:95016:211"/>and there would be an empty place in the World. As it is ſaid of <hi>David</hi> when he was abſent, that his place was empty at <hi>Sauls</hi> Table: Even ſo it would be in this caſe, if this great Ordinance of the Miniſtry ſhould be laid aſide there would be a great ſeparation of ſpace between the reſt of the Members, which would occaſion a great diſparagement and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſantneſs in the World, and in the reſt of the Miniſtrations of God, and would render them uncomely, and leſs deſirable.</p>
               <p>Thus then we plainly ſee, that to deſpiſe Propheſying, to turn the back upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, and other Ordinances (Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dixes thereof) muſt be a direct means for men and women to empty themſelves of the Holy Ghoſt, inſteed of filling themſelves with him. The knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Goſpel rightly underſtood, is that upon which the Spirit doth as it were feed in the ſouls of men; as the flame of fire doth upon oyl caſt upon it. And this knowledge is not, according to the Ordinary Providence and Diſpenſation of God in the World, to be otherwiſe had than by attending upon the Miniſtry of the Spirit, which is the Preaching of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>What thoſe Quenchers of the Spirit in themſelves, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> by the courſe we now ſpeak of, are wont to plead for themſelves, and to ſet a face of truth upon their error, whether from the Scriptures or otherwiſe, we have anſwered at large heretofore. For Sathan, when he perſwadeth any man to be mad, he furniſheth him with reaſons, ſuch as they are, to maintain it under the veil of ſoberneſs and truth; yea, never was there any Error in matters appertaining to Chriſtian Religion, how ſenſeleſs, uncouth, or pernicious ſoever ſet on foot, but that it pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divine Authority for it ſelf, and confirmation by the Scriptures; ſo doth the Error we now ſpeak of, which ſaith unto men, <hi>Deſpiſe ye Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying;</hi> never regard the Preaching of the Goſpel, eſpecially of thoſe that are the Miniſters thereof; For wherein is it to be eſteemed? This fond and moſt deſtructive Error (I ſay) claims acquaintance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with the Scriptures; as if it were a ſtrain of that Wiſdom which is revealed from heaven to make men wiſe unto Salvation; whereas indeed and in truth it is as oppoſite to it as the Eaſt is to the Weſt, as the Heaven is to the Earth. Two Scriptures eſpecially there are which are preſumed to countenance that moſt unchriſtian and prophane practice; The former is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10, 11. The latter is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. Both theſe places we formerly (I remember) examined ſomewhat at large (though now ſome while ſince) and found nothing at all in either of them complying with ſuch a practice; but ſomewhat in both ſtrongly oppoſing it, <hi>For this is the Covenant that I will make with the Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is evident, that this paſſage containeth a promiſe appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate unto the Nation of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which doth not appertain unto the Gentiles; this is evident from theſe words, <hi>The houſe of Iſrael, This is
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:95016:211"/>the Covenant I will make with the Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> Now though the word <hi>Iſrael</hi> put alone may ſometimes be found to ſignifie the whole Church, as conſiſting of <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles, who together are called, <hi>The Iſrael of God,</hi> Gal. 6.16. yet <hi>the houſe of Iſrael is never</hi> found, but to ſignifie this Nation and People by themſelves, and as diſtinct from others. It is needleſs to cite all the Texts in the Old Teſtament, where the Phraſe is uſed in that appropriate ſenſe we ſpeak of, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. only it is uſed four or five times in this ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 1.4, 5, 7, 17. beſides, that in the place in hand it is to be underſtood in that peculiar ſenſe is evident from the Context all along from <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7, &amp;c. So that by theſe words in the paſſage, <hi>And they ſhall not teach every man his Neighbour,</hi> it is evident that God ſpeaks to this people, touching this Covenant, with whom he had made the former Covenant, which muſt be the Jews, and containeth no promiſe made unto the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> but when this Promiſe ſhall be performed and made good unto the Jews, Shall not Believers among the Gentiles partake of it?</p>
               <p>I Reply; If by partaking of this Promiſe be meant, receiving bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and ſpiritual accommodation by it, it may be granted that they ſhall be made partakers of it, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſuch a ſenſe, as the World did partake of the extraordinary gifts of the Apoſtles; theſe gifts were not formally, or in the Letter of them granted unto any but unto the Apoſtles themſelves, though thouſands did reap benefit or bleſſings by them: In like manner, I ſuppoſe the words we ſpeak of are to be taken literally, and ſhall literally and according to the preciſeneſs of their ſignification be made good unto the <hi>Jews;</hi> and that things ſhall be at that paſs amongſt this people, that <hi>no man ſhall need to teach his Neighbour;</hi> yet it doth not follow, that therefore things ſhall be at the ſame paſs amongſt the Gentiles, though it ſhall be much better for the Gentiles, that knowledge ſhall thus abound among the <hi>Jews;</hi> they ſhall drink of the over-flowings of their Cup: for the Scriptures ſeem to hold forth ſuch an high Prerogative to the Jewiſh Nation, to be conferred upon them in the latter times, which are yet to come, <hi>viz.</hi> That the knowledge of God ſhould ſo wonderfully abound amongſt them, that the Nations of the Earth ſhould repair unto them by their Agents and Miniſters, to learn of them, and to receive encreaſe of light in the things of God from them. As the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> came to <hi>Solomon,</hi> to ſee and learn from him: So ſhall the Nations of the Gentiles repair unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to receive knowledge of God, and to encreaſe in the underſtanding of the Truth. The Scriptures of the Old Teſtament are full of ſuch Predictions as theſe, wherein ſuch a grace as this is peculiarly intended by God for the firſt-born Nation, that their Mountain ſhall be lifted up above all the Mountains of the Earth, and that all Nations ſhall repair to them for knowledge. Not to inſiſt on many more places at preſent (but leaving them to your own obſervation
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:95016:212"/>in reading) only that of <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.20, 21, 22. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, it ſhall yet come to paſs that there ſhall come People, and Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of many Cities; and the Inhabitants of one City ſhall go to another, ſaying, Let us go ſpeedily to pray before the Lord, and to ſeek the Lord of Hoſts; I will go alſo; yea, many People and ſtrong Nations ſhall come to ſeek the Lord of Hoſts in Jeruſalem, and to pray before the Lord.</hi> It is principally (I conceive) in reſpect of that advance in the knowledge of God which the Gentiles ſhall gain by the <hi>Jews</hi> when that Day we ſpeak of ſhall dawn upon them, that the Nations ſhall whet on, and ſtir up one another to go to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to enquire, So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.3. <hi>The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhall come to thy light, and Kings to the brightneſs of thy riſing, ten men ſhall take hold</hi> (out of all Languages of the Nations) <hi>of the skirt of him that is a Jew, ſaying, we will go with you, for we have heard that God is with you, Zech.</hi> 8.23. He was known in <hi>Jury,</hi> other Nations had not the like knowledge of him: But this will be alſo after a more rich and glorious manner; He ſhall put on more beautiful Apparel to viſit that Nation of the Jews (when the day cometh) than ever he was ſeen and enjoyed by any Nation under heaven before. And we know that their receiving and entertainment by God into grace and favour, is by the Apoſtle ſtyled. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. In reference to the Gentiles, <hi>A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead,</hi> and that which ſomewhat more particularly anſwereth thoſe words in the Scripture before us, which have the moſt appearance in them for the practice under reproof, is that <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>And they ſhall not teach every man his Neighbour, and every one his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaying, know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me from the greateſt to the leaſt:</hi> As to the clearing (I ſay) of this Paſſage it is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that the Scripture doth not Predict, that the knowledge of God ſhall ſimply, or in the general abound amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> when the time of their Reſtauration ſhall be; or that there ſhall be ſome, or ſome conſiderable numbers of them, to whom this excellency of knowledge ſhall be vouchſafed by God: But that the generality of this People, or the common ſort of them, ſhall be thus enriched by him. <hi>The earth</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaking of the Land of <hi>Judeah,</hi> and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of it, when the time ſpoken of ſhall come) <hi>ſhall be full of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea,</hi> Iſa. 11.9. There ſhall be an univerſal deluge, or overflowing of the knowledge of God over all the Land. And elſewhere, <hi>Thy people alſo ſhall be all righteous,</hi> Iſa. 60.21. So then, the Promiſe of the abundance of knowledge in the Scripture before us reſpecteth the Jews only in the ſenſe which hath been declared, there is no thing can be inferred from it by thoſe that are not of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Gentiles, as that they ſhall have the like abundance of knowledge given unto them. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe it ſhould not be appropriable only to the Jews, but equally appliable unto the Gentiles alſo; yet neither upon this
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:95016:212"/>ſuppoſition will it follow, that the time of the accompliſhment of it either to the Jews or to the Gentiles is yet come. Firſt, That the Jews have not yet attained the bleſſing promiſed therein, who yet in all reaſon ſhall be firſt ſerved (though it ſhould be ſuppoſed that the Gentiles ſhall ſit down at the ſame Table with them) is evident, in that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of that Nation remaineth to this day in that blindneſs and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> bewailed in them, in his daies. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, For the Gentiles, the ſaid Promiſes neither have been, nor are performed as yet unto them, is altogether as evident as the former; the generality of theſe being ſo far from ſuch a knowledge (that they have no need that any ſhould teach them) that we know they ſtand in need to be taught the very firſt Principles or Foundations of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>Nor can it reaſonably be here replied or ſaid, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> that though the ſaid Promiſe be not as yet fulfilled in the generality of the Gentiles; yet it may be begun to be fulfilled in ſome of them, and the fuller accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it may by degrees take place untill the times of the plenary and perfect fulfilling of it ſhall come; for againſt this there are ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations:</p>
               <p n="1">1. As you heard lately, that the Promiſe is not made to the Gentiles, but to the Jews.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It hath not been made good, no not in the ſenſe now pleaded for, unto the Jews themſelves, not ſo much as to a handful of them, they generally remaining ſtill in the hardneſs of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> hearts, and in that blindneſs of their minds, wherein they were in the Apoſtles daies; they are ſo far from the knowledge of God, and of the Goſpel of his Son as ever they were, and yet all, or the moſt part of them will be firſt ſerved, and have the preeminency and firſt fruits of this glory.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Scriptures intimate as if this Promiſe were to be fulfilled ſuddenly, and at once when it beginneth to be fulfilled. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.7, 8. It is made matter of high admiration, <hi>Before ſhe travelled ſhe brought forth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day?</hi> Or <hi>ſhall a Nation be born at once?</hi> &amp;c. The travel of <hi>Sion</hi> ſeemeth to note ſome ſuch change and alteration in her condition, which withall intimateth a ſtrange and unexpected expedition, and that ſhe ſhall be raiſed and built up in a very ſhort time unto a very glorious State and Nation; and therefore the Prophet calls it, the bringing forth of a Nation in one day. So again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.22. <hi>I the Lord will haſten it in his time;</hi> meaning, that when the time ſhould come, then he would haſten it, and would bring it into perfection very ſuddenly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If a few mens excelling in knowledge were the fulfilling of the ſaid Propheſie and Promiſe, then was it fulfilled in the Apoſtles daies, for there were many (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5.) <hi>That in every thing ye are enriched by him in all utterance, and in all knowledge.</hi> It ſeemeth, that in this one
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:95016:213"/>Church there was a great floud of light, inſomuch that they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now to learn, but did wait for the full appearance of the Lord Chriſt; and yet that theſe Promiſes of Chriſt were not fulfilled in thoſe daies (in the ſenſe declared) is evident, becauſe the Apoſtle preſſed the duty of Preaching upon others, and layeth a heavy curſe upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Woe is me if I preach not the Goſpel.</hi> How many paſſages may we find in his Epiſtles of the ſame import?</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, The perſons themſelves, who do pretend this Promiſe, and paſſage of Scripture to juſtifie them in their way, do make uſe of ſomewhat like the Miniſtry and Preaching of the Goſpel; they have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Methods, which they pretend to edifie themſelves by; ſo that they do offer an affront to themſelves, and do condemn themſelves in thoſe things which they do allow. And if they judge themſelves capable of any benefit by theſe their meetings; certainly, there is a thouſand times more reaſon, why we ſhould expect and look for more from the publick Miniſtry of the Goſpel, by ſuch who have a competent anointing of the Spirit of God. If they do interpret, and give a ſenſe of what they ſpeak, or affirm, and produce from the Scriptures, then as I ſay, why ſhould we not rather hearken unto the judgment and ſenſe of them that attend upon the Word and Prayer (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) who are ſet apart as it were, and who do ſeparate themſelves unto God, and to his Service, and of the Tabernacle? That they ſhould be likely to give out the mind and ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt, in the Scriptures, above others is reaſonable to conceive. The <hi>Eunuch</hi> was in all likelihood a great man, and ſurely a man of more than ordinary parts and abilities; and yet he profeſſeth plainly unto <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 8.31. when he asked him if he underſtood what he read, <hi>How</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>can I except ſome man ſhould guide me?</hi> [or I have ſome one to interpret.] It is true, it is one thing, what the Spirit of God is able to do for men; but it is another, what he himſelf judgeth meet for him to do. And certainly he doth not judge it meet to build with one hand, and to pull down with the other hand; which yet he ſhould do, having erected an Ordinance, as he hath done, giving ſome to be Paſtors and Teachers for the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; if theſe things might be gained otherwiſe, (I mean) in an ordinary way; and where the Miniſtry which Chriſt hath ſet on foot may be had and enjoyed. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) To the Scripture before us, although it ſhould be granted to be already fulfilled, yet it is not neceſſary to underſtand theſe Expreſſions <hi>(They ſhall not teach every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother)</hi> literally, but figuratively, by an Hyperbole (A figure wherein the Holy Ghoſt much delighteth) as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.6, 22.</p>
               <p>For the other Scripture mentioned, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.27. <hi>But the anointing which ye have received of him, remaineth</hi> (or abideth) <hi>in you, and ye need not that any man ſhould teach you, but as the anointing teacheth you,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:95016:213"/>implying that the former things which he had written to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe that ſeduced them, (that is, thoſe men who went about to ſeduce them) according to the Language of the Scripture, wherein when any Impoſtor perſwadeth, or uſeth means to ſeduce, he is ſaid to ſeduce, though the perſons thus perſwaded are not actually ſeduced: As theſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were not actually ſeduced; and yet he writeth to them concerning thoſe that ſeduced them; and then he cloſeth his Admonition thus, <hi>But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the anointing which ye have received of him</hi> (meaning Chriſt) <hi>abideth in you.</hi> As if he had ſaid, it is true, that which I have written is in order to fortifie, and to ſtrengthen you againſt thoſe who go about to enſnare and entangle you; but (ſaith he) you have another means and help in your ſelves, by which to preſerve your ſelves from them, and from their ſnares. Now by this anointing, I ſuppoſe, he means not properly the Holy Ghoſt, though he was in them, and according to Scripture-phraſe may be very properly ſaid to abide in them: But by anointing (I conceive) he rather means the work of the Spirit which he had wrought in them; that is, the impreſſions of Holineſs, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Goodneſs, their love to God and Men. This is that anointing which they had received, and (ſaith he) you need not that any man teach you, but as this anointing teacheth you; meaning, that they needed not that any thing ſhould be offered unto them, but that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they might be competent Judges, by means of thoſe holy Principles of Righteouſneſs and Love, which the Holy Ghoſt had wrought and raiſed in them. For the Goſpel, in the whole compaſs or circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of it, being a Doctrine according unto godlineſs, men that have a Principle of Godlineſs, rich, and full, and any whit raiſed, may ſent any Doctrine, and if they will but conſult with the Oracles in their own breaſts they may find out and come to underſtand whether it be according unto Godlineſs, yea, or no. If it carrieth any repugnancy unto Godlineſs, or unto Holineſs, then (ſaith he) you have no need of it, you are better without it. This anointing is truth, and it is no lie; As if he had ſaid, they themſelves could not but know it; for Godlineſs is a real Propenſity of heart and ſoul unto that which is Good, Juſt, and Righteous, and which maketh for the glory of God, and well-being of men; theſe are the Royal things of God, not liable to any diſpute whether they be true, or whether they be falſe deluſions; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſaith he) having ſuch an anointing within you, you need not that any man ſhould teach you any thing lying above the reach of this: For let any Doctrine or Practice whatſoever come to you, if it comport and fall in with this Principle, then you may receive it. And he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implieth here, that though the ſame anointing teacheth all things; yet they that had this anointing had need that men ſhould teach them, according as this teacheth them. And the truth is, that men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that are godly, and have this anointing in the fulleſt meaſure,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:95016:214"/>have need to be taught thoſe things which are conſonant and agreeable to this anointing, and which will nouriſh, enlarge, quicken, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive it. So that this place is ſo far from countenancing that Notion or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice by which men turn aſide from the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, that it proveth, and that very clear, that they indeed ought to attend upon it.</p>
               <p>The perſons now under reproof, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> beſides what they pretend and plead, directly and immediately from the Scriptures, have other Arguments and Pleas to harden themſelves in their Practice. Let us therefore deal with them, as ſober men uſe to deal with them that are frantick and mad, when they have gotten Knives, or Swords, wherewith they are like to do either themſelves or others a miſchief, they wreſt them out of their hands; In like manner, let us try by evidence and ſtrength of reaſon, and of truth to take away thoſe weapons (at leaſt) the chief of them, wherein they put their truſt.</p>
               <p>One thing they pretend, why they ſhould not attend upon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Goſpel, is, that the Miniſters in theſe daies are not infallible. We cannot ſafely depend upon them in what they teach us; they may lead us into error as well as truth. Is not this a Conſideration ſufficient to juſtifie us in our taking our ſelves off from hearing them? To this I reply:</p>
               <p>Firſt, By putting the queſtion to them, Whether they judge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be infallible or no? If they anſwer Affirmatively, that they do judge themſelves infallible (which I ſuppoſe they will not) then Why ſhould not the Miniſters of the Goſpel be as infallible as they? Beſides, if they be infallible, What need they fear of being led aſide into Error by the Miniſters of the Goſpel? But it is like they will reply Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and grant that they are not infallible: If ſo, why then do they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon themſelves, or upon their own Notions, or Apprehenſions, or upon their own ſenſes and interpretations of Scripture? May they not as well be miſtaken and deceived by leaning unto theſe as unto ſuch things which ſhall be by the Miniſters of the Goſpel delivered unto them? Or will theſe perſons themſelves be only Sceptiques, and profeſs that they are abſolute Neutraliſts in all manner of Tenents and Opinions in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; or that they doubt of every thing, and firmly believe nothing? If they profeſs this, they are more degenerate from men than the generality of the Heathen: They firmly believe that there is one God, and that he is good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, they are worſe than the devils, of whom <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>That they believe there is one God and tremble.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſuch a Profeſſion as this, that men believe nothing in matters of Religion, interfeers with it ſelf; for he that ſaith he believes nothing, certainly pretends herein to know certainly that all things are doubtful, yea, and to know certainly that it is beſt for him to be of this Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that all things are uncertain, and therefore nothing for him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Otherwiſe, Why is he thus minded, why doth he not rather ſubmit to the contrary? But this <hi>laſt</hi> Scepticiſm is a ſtrain of folly not worth the contending againſt.</p>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:95016:214"/>
               <p>But to the Reaſon propounded, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> by which the ſeekers of ſuperordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancers do make attempt to juſtifie their practice in giving over the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the Goſpel, I reply:</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Scribes and Phariſees were (doubtleſs) every whit as far from being infallible, as the Miniſters of the Goſpel now are; yet our Saviour himſelf (<hi>Mat.</hi> 23.2, 3.) counſelled the people, and his own Diſciples too, to hear them, yea, and to do, and obſerve whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall teach them to obſerve. Therefore certainly it is lawful, yea, and more than lawful, expedient and neceſſary to attend upon the Miniſtry of men that are fallible, if there be no other bar in the way but their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallible (eſpecially, if there be no opportunity to attend upon men that be infallible) whileſt they keep within the compaſs of <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair, that is, that they open unto us the mind of God in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When Chriſt admoniſhed the people, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.18. <hi>To take heed how, or what they heard;</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21. <hi>To try or prove all things, and to hold faſt that which is good;</hi> Both the one and the other clearly implied that it is lawful, yea, and neceſſary too, to hear ſuch men who are obnoxious unto error and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake; otherwiſe, what need was there for men to take heed what it was they ſhould hear (meaning, that they ſhould narrowly conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was Error, or whether it was truth) if they who were to teach them were infallible? If Chriſt had been of their minds with whom we have to do, he would rather have admoniſhed the people to take heed they heard not at all, than (as he doth) to take heed what they heard: Nor would the Apoſtle have adviſed the <hi>Theſſalonians to prove all things, and hold faſt that which is Good,</hi> if he had not preſumed that they ſhould or were to hear men that were fallible, and who might poſſibly deliver unto them ſome things that were not meet to be received.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Though it be ſuppoſed that the Apoſtles themſelves were infallible, yet other Paſtors and Teachers in thoſe times were not ſuch: yet the chief of choſe who were infallible, the Apoſtles, but <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> adviſed thoſe Chriſtians, with whom they had to do, to honour and obey thoſe Teachers, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>And we beſeech you Brethren, know them which labour amongſt you, and are over you in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſouls.</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>Let the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that rule well be had in double honour,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> chargeth the Paſtors to feed the Flock of God amongſt them, and conſequently enjoyns the Flock to depend upon them for their food.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Neither was <hi>Timothy,</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> writeth two Epiſtles, infallible (and there is the ſame conſideration of <hi>Titus</hi>) yet he tells him, <hi>That by taking heed to himſelf, and to his Doctrine and continuing in them, he ſhould not only ſave himſelf, but them alſo that heard
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:95016:215"/>him,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. meaning, that partly by the exemplarineſs of his life; partly alſo, by his care and diligence in teaching, he ſhould be an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in the hand of God to ſave thoſe that ſhould attend upon his Miniſtry. By the way, in ſaying he ſhould <hi>ſave thoſe that heard him,</hi> he plainly implieth, that they that did not <hi>hear him</hi> (having opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to do it) nor yet any other of like Function and Miniſtry with him were not like to be ſaved. That he was not infallible appears, Firſt, by that Item and Admonition the Apoſtle gives unto him in the place now mentioned, <hi>viz. To take heed to his Doctrine,</hi> as well as to himſelf. To take heed unto a mans Doctrine at leaſt imports that a man very poſſibly may build <hi>Wood, Hay, and Stubble,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Silver, Gold, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones;</hi> yea, that without narrowly examining and weighing what he doth teach, he is very apt to do it; ſo that this clearly ſuppoſeth that <hi>Timothy</hi> was in danger of miſcarrying. So again ſecondly, <hi>When he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth him to remember,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.8. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt of the Seed of</hi> David, <hi>was raiſed from the dead according to his Goſpel;</hi> he clearly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, that he was far from being infallible, and that Exhorration like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unto him to hold faſt the form of ſound words which he had heard from him is of like import. So that evident it is, that Miniſters, or men who are not infallible may notwithſtanding be a rich bleſſing unto thoſe that ſhall hear them, and accommodate them at no lower rate than with Salvation it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, When the Apoſtle, both in his former Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy, Cha.</hi> 3. and ſo again, in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus, Chap.</hi> 1. deſcribes and preſcribes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Characters and Properties that ought to be minded and found in thoſe who were meet to be choſen in the places of Paſtors and Teachers, amongſt them all he doth not mention infallibility; Indeed he requires in ſuch perſons that they ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>apt to teach,</hi> or of a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. And again, that they <hi>ſhould be able by ſound Doctrine both to exhort, and to convince the gainſayers,</hi> Tit. 1.9. And thus he that is not infallible may be able to teach, but infallibility is not required.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> How far, and in what reſpect the Apoſtles themſelves were infallible is worthy of conſideration. Certain it is, that their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility (I mean, in the actings of it, and in thoſe Services which by means hereof they were in a capacity to perform unto the World,) did depend upon their care and circumſpection; ſo that notwithſtanding that gift of infallibility which was given unto, and veſted in them, in caſe they were at any time incogitant, or leſs attentive to the motions and teachings of the Holy Ghoſt within them, they might deviate and ſwerve from the truth. As we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf, the great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of the Circumciſion (<hi>i.e.</hi> the Jews) when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him to the face,</hi> becauſe he was to be blamed or condemned in that act of his, in withdrawing himſelf from the Gentiles, and communion
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:95016:215"/>with them, to gratifie and pleaſe the Jews. The Apoſtle calls it, <hi>A not walking uprightly or with a ſtreight foot, according to the truth of the Goſpel, i. e.</hi> either as the Goſpel, truly or aright underſtood, required of him and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> or rather as the truth of the Goſpel for its own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and propagation in the World <hi>required of them;</hi> ſo though this Error in <hi>Peter</hi> was not formally and directly a miſcarriage in Doctrine, yet interpretatively and equivalently it was; for it was a kind of impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and conſtructive teaching of men, that the Partition Wall between the Jews and the Gentiles was not broken down, and that the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſaical</hi> Ceremonies were yet in force; and conſequently the Meſſiah was not yet come, or however had not yet ſuffered; which are all errors, and this of very ill conſequence. So that we ſee the Apoſtles themſelves as infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible as they were, yet without a ſerious, cloſe, and conſcientious mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what they had received from the Holy Ghoſt might miſtake. And truly Miniſters of the Goſpel in theſe daies, by ſuch an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of themſelves as this is. I mean, by a diligent and conſciencious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending unto what the Holy Ghoſt hath delivered unto them in the Scriptures, may in their Doctrines and Teachings ſerve the World well near upon as good and happy terms, as if they were infallible. For,</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Nortwithſtanding that infallibility which was veſted in the Apoſtles, yet thoſe that heard them were to examine and ſearch into the Scriptures, to find whether the Doctrines taught by them were agreeable unto them or no; and their belief of what the Apoſtles taught them was not ſolid or compleat untill they had thus caſt their Doctrine into the fire of the Scriptures to try whether it would not burn: And when they found that the Scriptures gave the right hand of Fellowſhip unto it, then it was their own; now they were ſatisfied with it, and full of peace by it. You know that paſſage of the <hi>Bereans, Acts</hi> 17.11, 12. Though the Doctrine which was preached unto them by <hi>Paul</hi> had not only the Authority of ſo great an Apoſtle as he was to atteſt it, but the mouth of another very conſiderable witneſs (I mean <hi>Silas;</hi>) yet they would not receive it untill they had ſearched the Scriptures. Now then, if the Doctrines which the Apoſtles themſelves did preach were and ought to be tried by thoſe that heard them, and upon ſuch a trial as this they were to give entertainment unto them and believe them; then it lay upon them, the hearers of the Apoſtles themſelves, by way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to examine ſuch Doctrines as were delivered unto them. There is the ſame reaſon now, and Chriſtians are in the ſame capacity, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into, and examine, by the Touchſtone of the Scriptures, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Doctrine ſhall be delivered unto them; and it lieth upon them as a duty to ſearch the Scriptures accordingly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If this courſe were but taken by men, there would be no more danger of their being miſtaken now than there was in the Apoſtles daies.</p>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:95016:216"/>
               <p>Ninthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> The great and bleſſed end (which is moſt conſiderable, as to the ſtopping the mouth of all that can be pretended for that plea of infallibility) may be reached and obtained, though the Miniſter be not infallible; yea, though in ſomething in his Doctrines he ſhould be miſtaken; yea (and that which is more than this) though they that hear him ſhould be carried away with ſome of his errors and miſtakes; yet the great, bleſſed, and ſovereign ends of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel may be obtained. There are two great ends of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, the one ſubordinate unto the other: the converſion of men unto God, and the building them up in holineſs, and preparing, and making them meet for the Kingdom of heaven; the ſovereign and ſupreme end is the ſaving of their ſouls; we include the glory of God in them both: Now the Miniſtry, as to both theſe ends, may be mightily effectual, and full of authority and power, though the Miniſter ſhould be obnoxious to miſtakes. I remember it was the ſaying of an ancient Father, miſtake or error, in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if it hath not pertinaciouſnes and ſtubbornneſs joyned with it, doth not oppoſe holineſs in men. Faith and Love may be wrought and raiſed in men thorough Arguments, Motives, and Conſiderations which lie fair and large in the Goſpel, notwithſtanding there may be a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of ſome Miſpriſion in the Miniſter. For the Arguments and grounds which are moſt convincing, and which are moſt awfull, and carry the greateſt authority with the conſciences and ſouls of men, are ſuch which not only the Miniſter that preacheth them, but even the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of men may be infallible, as to the judgment of the truth of them, and of their nature and weight (at leaſt to a degree) ſo as to weigh them ſo far as to come to underſtand that there is enough of truth in them to bring their hearts unto ſubjection unto them. The Arguments in the Scriptures for theſe ends and purpoſes are ſo plain and ſo evident, that it is not lightly poſſible for men to miſtake herein. For what is the great work that the Goſpel and the Miniſters of it have to do with the Children of men? It is only to bring them off from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to make them have little liſt to pleaſe themſelves; to pull down imaginations and ſtrong holds, and all high thoughts that exalt themſelves in the minds and inward thoughts to men, and to bring them into ſubjection to Jeſus Chriſt. Now then, thoſe thoughts in men which are to be demoliſhed, and brought down by the Engines of the Goſel, are diſcernable enough, and do diſcover and utter themſelves in the waies, and ſometimes from the lips and mouths of men; namely, in waies of covetouſneſs, earthly mindedneſs, deceit, ſinful pleaſures, idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vain diſcourſe, and the like. So that (I ſay) it is not hard matter to come to this concluſion, without any danger of miſtake, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly theſe men do build upon ſuch and ſuch foundations; they have ſuch and ſuch thoughts and imaginations within them, that theſe waies are better and more commodious for them than the waies of God, than
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:95016:216"/>the waies of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs would be. This may ſafely be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed from that eſſential connexion and relation, which is between ſuch Practices and Principles, ſuch thoughts, imaginations, and actions; And by this means the Miniſters of the Goſpel may be capable enough to declare ſuch thoughts and imaginations unto men which lie deep in their hearts. And then again, as touching ſuch truths of the Goſpel, by which ſuch imaginations are to be overthrown and pulled down, they are ſo clear, and ſo agreeable with the light of reaſon, and common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings planted in men, that there is little fear or matter of doubt that they ſhould be deceived or entangled with any error herein; or howſoever, if the things which ſhall be delivered be proper to demoliſh and throw down theſe vile thoughts, lying conceits and imaginations, be they what they will, the very oppoſition which ſhall be found in them unto thoſe corruptions is ground ſufficient, and teſtimony in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on their behalf that they are truths, yea, and that they are the truths of God. And therefore as to the greateſt matters and main work of the Goſpel and Miniſtry thereof, although the Miniſters ſhould be men as ſubject unto error as other men, and as weak this way, as the Apoſtle ſaith of himſelf, and other Chriſtians in his daies, that <hi>they knew but in part:</hi> Even ſo, if we that are Miniſters ſhall but <hi>Propheſie in part;</hi> nay, though we ſhould mingle with our Propheſying ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes and miſpriſions, yet through the grace of God, and that bleſſing annexed by promiſe unto this erection and eſtabliſhment of the Miniſtry for the building up of men in holineſs, and in the love of God, and in the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, theſe great and bleſſed ends may go on with an high hand, and men and women may be promoted into the love and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and thereby made meet for the heavenly Kingdom, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great pretenſe of fallibility.</p>
               <p>Another pretenſe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> which the perſons now under reproof ſometimes plead, to make that ſeem ſtreight which is crooked, and to juſtifie that which is to be condemned (I mean, their practice of turning aſide from the Miniſtry of the Goſpel) is, that the Miniſters in theſe daies do not, cannot work miracles, as the Apoſtles did; and therefore they do not hear them.</p>
               <p>This Pretext hath leſs in it than either of the former: For where doth the Scripture make the want of a gift of working Miracles in them that preach the Goſpel a ground or reaſon why men ſhould not hear them? It is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.41. of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt that he wrought no <hi>Miracles;</hi> yet the Lord Chriſt ſaid of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.35. <hi>That he was a burning and a ſhining light;</hi> and it was propheſyed of him by an Angel from heaven, <hi>That he ſhould turn many of the Children of Iſrael unto the Lord their God;</hi> and that he ſhould <hi>be filled with the Holy Ghoſt even from his mothers womb,</hi> Luke 1.15. Nor do we read that <hi>Timothy</hi> had the gift of working Miracles; yet <hi>Paul</hi> chargeth him before God, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:95016:217"/>the Lord Jeſus, who ſhall judge the quick and the dead, at his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Kingdom, <hi>That he ſhould preach the Word, that he be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, that he ſhould reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffering and Doctrine,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.1, 2. And (as we lately heard) aſſureth him that by taking heed unto <hi>himſelf, and to his Doctrine,</hi> by a continuing therein, <hi>he ſhould both ſave himſelf and thoſe who ſhould hear him,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.16. Again, the men with whom we have to do are not willing to be looked upon as Infidels or Unbelievers; if not, then what have they to do with Miracles or Miracles wiht them? Propheſying or Preaching, without Miracles, is for them who do believe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Tongues (ſaith the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Tongues extraordinarily and miraculouſly given) are for a ſign, <hi>not to them that do believe, but to them that believe not; but Propheſying ſerveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.22. So that men and women, who own the Goſpel to be a truth, and to come from God, need no Sign or Miracle, but an effectual opening and applying this Goſpel in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts and branches of it unto them. By the way, when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>that Tongues are not for a ſign to thoſe that believe, but to thoſe that believe not,</hi> he doth not mean, as if thoſe who do believe could receive no benefit or edification by Signs or Miracles, but only meer Infidels. For (doubtleſs) they who do believe may receive a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and encreaſe of their Faith from Signs: As the Diſciples of Chriſt themſelves are ſaid to have <hi>believed</hi> on him (with a new Faith, or a Faith renewed and encreaſed, for they did believe on him before) upon his firſt Miracle of turning Water into Wine, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.11. But the Apoſtles meaning is, that Miracles, or Signs, are not ſo neceſſary for thoſe who do already believe, though but in part: As for thoſe who are wholly unbelieving; the reaſon is, becauſe they who are wholly Infidels and unbelieving, are Neglecters or Deſpiſers, if not profeſſed Enemies and Oppoſers of the Goſpel, and therefore they ſtand in need of more than ordinary means for their awakening and conviction; and it would be in vain to open or apply any part of the Goſpel unto them who perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily reject the whole. Whereas when a man ſo far believeth, that he owneth the Goſpel in general as from God, the rational unfolding and effectual applying of particulars unto him cannot but conduce much to his edification.</p>
               <p>Again, Whereas it is ſaid, that <hi>Propheſying ſerveth not for thoſe that believe not, but for thoſe that do believe;</hi> the meaning is not, as if Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying or Preaching of the Goſpel, even where Signs and Miracles are wanting, might not work upon thoſe who are wholly unbelieving to their converſion; (The Apoſtle himſelf plainly enough ſuppoſeth the contrary two or three verſes after) but Propheſying ſerveth not, or is not for thoſe who do not believe, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſerveth not ſo effectually the neceſſities and ſpiritual exigences of profeſſed Infidels, as it doth the intereſt and occaſions of them who do in part believe.</p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:95016:217"/>
               <p>Comparative ſenſes or meanings are frequently in Scripture expreſſed in abſolute and poſitive terms (as heretofore upon like occaſion we have from time to time ſignified unto you, and given you ſeveral inſtances;) I ſhall only add two or three things more briefly by way of further an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to te pretenſe, concerning the neceſſity of working Miracles by Miniſters in theſe daies.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That Miracles, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> in caſe Miniſters of the Goſpel in theſe daies had the gift of them, would not convert men (at leaſt) not ſuch who are hardned in their unbelief, and maliciouſly bent in their ſpirits againſt the Goſpel. This is evident from what we read, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.37. <hi>For though he had done ſo many Miracles before them, yet they believed not on him.</hi> We ſee here that not ſimply Miracles, but that Miracle upon Miracle, many Miracles, abundance of Miracles ſometimes wil not do the deed, will not ſo far convince men, as to prevail with them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. So again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.20, 21, &amp;c. <hi>Then began he to upbraid the Cities wherein moſt of his mighty works were done, becauſe they repented not. Woe unto thee Corazin,</hi> &amp;c. Here we read of ſeveral Cities which had the help and advantage, not of Miracles ſimply, but of mighty Miracles, <hi>mighty works;</hi> yea, and of great variety of theſe [wherein he had done moſt of his mighty works;] yea, of ſundry <hi>mighty Miracles</hi> wrought by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who (queſtionleſs) wrought them upon terms of all poſſible advantage to make them effectual for the ends for which they were wrought; in which reſpect (I conceive) it is, that they amongſt whom they were wrought are ſaid to be lifted up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Yet, I ſay, there was not ſo much as any one of all theſe Cities, that were thus filled with great Miracles, with mighty Works, <hi>that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,</hi> or were brought over to believe in Chriſt by means of them. If the men therefore now under reproof were gratified in their importune deſire, as the murmuring <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſometimes were in theirs, when God gave them fleſh till it came out again at their noſtrils: So if theſe men had their fill of miracles from the Miniſters of the Goſpel, it is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether theſe would have any ſaving influence upon them or no. And the reaſon (to add this by the way, becauſe we are upon a point that we ſeldom have occaſion to handle) why Miracles may very poſſibly do little good, where there is a ſtrong Antipathy againſt the Goſpel may be this, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe when men are greatly averſe from believing or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting they are not like to beſtow any ſerious or intenſe conſideration upon the means by which they ſhould be brought to do either, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to paſs lightly and ſlightly by them; eſpecially, if they can find out any colour or pretenſe to diſparage them, and ſo to arm their Judgments and Conſciences againſt them. This was the reaſon (doubtleſs) why none of the Cities in which Chriſt had wrought moſt of his Miracles and mighty Works were drawn to repentance hereby; And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, why ſo few of the Scribes and Phariſees believed in him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:95016:218"/>ſo many Miracles wrought before their eyes; it was the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous averſeneſs both to his Doctrine and Perſon, that quickly took off their minds and thoughts from ſuch things, whether words or works, which they found medling or dealing with their Conſciences that way; I mean, which they found in any degree enclining them to believe on him; ſo that theſe means could not have their perfect work upòn their ſouls. For whether words or works they muſt be kept for ſome time upon the mind and intellectual faculties of the ſoul before they can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh any tranſmutation or change there. It is a common Maxime in Philoſophy, that no motion is effected or brought to paſs in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>There muſt be time for the ſtrongeſt Phyſick to work, for there is ſome averſeneſs in the body againſt it: So before there can be any ſuch repentance and believing in the ſoul, the means by which this muſt be effected muſt have ſome time to work upon the underſtanding; and therefore if they be thrown by ſo ſoon as they begin to work the bleſſed change will never ſucceed or take place. Or elſe becauſe there are lying and falſe Miracles as well as true; and very ſtrange things are ſometimes done by Magick, Sorcery, and by the help of Devils, and the like; therefore they ſatisfie themelves with a like conceit, that the great works of Chriſt were of this baſtard kind of Miracles, and ſo maintained and hardned themſelves in their Unbelief, all his great Works and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles notwithſtanding. And I remember it was the opinion of one of the Ancient Fathers, that <hi>Judas</hi> thought that his Lord and Maſter wrought all his great Cures and Works only by the Art of Magick, and the Jews have ſuch a conceipt of him at this day. So then, Miracles, if the Miniſters of the Goſpel in theſe daies had the gift of them, might poſſibly little accommodate the men who under a pretenſe (it is to be feared) ſo impatiently call for them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> It argueth men and women to be of a very unworthy frame of heart, and much eſtranged in mind and ſpirit from God, and from the things appertaining unto him, to require or ſtand in need of Miracles for their Conviction and Converſion to the Faith. This is evident from that of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.48. <hi>Except ye ſee Signs and Wonders ye will not believe.</hi> It is evident that theſe words are objurgatory, ſtriking at ſuch a ſpirit or frame of heart (in the perſons to whom they were ſpoken, <hi>Except yet ſee ſigns,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, ye (Jews) are of ſuch an ill ſpirit and frame of heart that ſuch means which are in themſelves ſufficient to perſwade or bring men to believe, ſufficient to prevail in this kind with perſons of any tolerable diſpoſition Godward, as ſuch heavenly and authoritative teachings from holy and worthy men are, theſe will do no execution, will not convince you; but you muſt have ſuch means uſed and applied to work upon you to do you any good, which are ſufficient to break the Iron ſinews of the moſt prophane ſtiff-necked,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:95016:218"/>and obdurate Infidel under heaven; you muſt ſee <hi>Signs,</hi> yea, Wonders, or Prodigies of Signs. Men that are in any degree ingenuous, and willing to walk up to theſe lower and more common principles of truth, which are by nature planted in them, or deſirous in the leaſt to underſtand and ſubmit to the truth, they ſtand in no need of Signs and Wonders to ſatisfie and convince them of the truth (I mean, of the truth of a more ſpiritual and ſublime nature) but only of a lightſome and rational diſcovery of ſuch truth. As the wood that is dry will readily take the fire and burn only by putting coals of fire to it; whereas that which is green requireth much puffing and blowing, and many times will not burn at laſt, though all this means he uſed to it. Therefore the perſons that muſt have Miracles, and ſay they cannot edifie, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not profit by the Miniſters of the Goſpel in theſe daies, becauſe they cannot work Miracles, their own tongues fall upon them (as <hi>Davids</hi> Expreſſion is:) by ſuch ſayings they plainly declare themſelves to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons much eſtranged from God, to bear little love to the truth. Our Saviour in the Goſpel calleth the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.39. &amp; 16.4. <hi>An evil and adulterous Generation,</hi> for ſeeking after a Sign or Miracle for their ſatisfaction about the truth of his Doctrine: having occaſion to ſpeak upon the ſame account unto the generality of people, He leaves out the word <hi>Adulterous,</hi> only ſtyling them, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.29. <hi>An evil Generation for ſeeking after a ſign.</hi> Why doth our Saviour call the <hi>Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> not ſimply an <hi>evil,</hi> but an <hi>adulterous Generation</hi> alſo upon occaſion of their ſeeking after a Sign? We know an adulterous diſpoſition imports the departure and eſtrangedneſs of heart and affection from the perſon whom we ought, by reaſon of our Conjugal Engagement, to love and affect above all others, together with the beſtowing of them upon ſome other perſon whom we ought not to affect in any ſuch way: Now then, our Saviour calling the Scribes and Phariſees an <hi>Adulterous Generation,</hi> chargeth them that their hearts and ſouls were wickedly and baſely alienated and eſtranged from God, unto whom they were married by Covenant, and ſhould have cleaved with their whole heart and ſoul, and have been of one heart and ſpirit with him; whereas now they had coupled themſelves with this preſent World, with the honours, riches, and pleaſures thereof; and thereby they did plainly bewray their nakedneſs, in this kind, in that the voice and word of God, which ſhould have been familiar unto them, as the voice of a Husband ſhould be to a Wife, which they ſhould have known without any Diſpute or Argument to make them know it, was become ſo ſtrange unto them, that they were as far to ſeek whether it was his Word or no, as they who never knew him, nor ſcarce had heard of him; and that they required as much ſatisfaction to be aſſured thereof, as might ſerve to ſatisfie the greateſt ſtranger under heaven. So that they who call for Miracles upon the account mentioned declare themſelves
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:95016:219"/>to be of the race of the Scribes and Phariſees who are an adulterous Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) The holy and exemplary lives, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> and righteous converſations of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, where perſons have time and opportunity to obſerve and know them, are as authoritative and mighty to convince men of the truth of the Doctrines they teach as Miracles themſelves would be, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.31. And as we lately heard, that our Saviour ſeverely taxed thoſe that would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve except they ſaw Signs and Wonders; ſo the Holy Ghoſt himſelf repreſents ſuch perſons, as worſe than Harlots who did believe without Signs and Wonders, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.32. <hi>John came unto you in the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and ye believed him not: but the Publicans and Harlots believed him.</hi> So likewiſe elſewhere the Holy Ghoſt adjudgeth ſuch to be perſons more degenerate from the nature and property of men than ordinary, to be ſignally wicked and perverſe, that would not hearken to the Doctrine of ſuch Teachers who were excellently righteous and holy.</p>
               <p>And to add this as a cloſe of this particular; it is probable that the Apoſtles themſelves wrought not Miracles, but at their firſt coming to a place, and that they did not make uſe of them in thoſe places after any long ſtay in them. The reaſon may be, becauſe at their firſt coming to a place Miracles might be an effectual means to awaken men; whereas if they ſtaid but any conſiderable time, then they had the means and opportunities to obſerve their lives and converſations. NOw this would do the ſame ſervice in regard of the truth, and for the confirmation of what they preached that Miracles could do. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> when he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he continued three years in preaching the things of God; there is no mention of any Miracles that he wrought there; becauſe he had opportunity to give an account and ſufficient confirmation of the truth of his Doctrine by the holineſs and heavenlineſs of his life and converſation. So that it is but a vain and empty pretenſe to talk of ſigns and Miracles now for the confirmation of the Doctrine of the Goſpel; for indeed in ſpeaking ſuch things, and making ſuch demands, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate themſelves to be (as was even now ſaid) of the race of thoſe that are called an <hi>Adulterous Generation</hi> by the Lord Chriſt, who was not wont to ſlander men.</p>
               <p>Another Pretenſe or Plea inſiſted upon by the perſons under cenſure, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> for juſtification of themſelves in their unchriſtian deportment, in ſaying to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, depart from us, we deſire thee not, is this; it is unto them but as ſalt that is infatuated, and hath loſt its ſavour: we find no benefit by it, we are not edified, nor built up in our moſt holy Faith; we have been oft rained upon by it, and yet we do not flouriſh under it.</p>
               <p>I reply firſt, Though (haply) it be not meet to charge all thoſe who
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:95016:219"/>are in the condemantion we ſpeak of, with alledging that which they do not only know is not truth, but what they know to be contrary unto the truth, as a ground of their practice; Yet is it much to be feared that ſome of them pick the quarrel againſt the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, on a quite contrary ground, becauſe it hath too much ſavour, and bites, and gnaws, and beareth hard upon their Conſciences: This (I ſay) is much to be feared is the true cauſe why many of them withdraw from it, and are not able to bear the dread and terrour of it. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16.) <hi>are unto thoſe that periſh the ſavour of death unto death.</hi> The Goſpel is ſo ſevere againſt thoſe whoſe heart will not yield unto it, that it kindles the ſavour and ſmell (as it were) of the fire and brimſtone of hell in thier Conſciences, it makes them to know that they are a moſt curſed Generation of men and women; the words thereof to wicked men are like the words of <hi>Michaiah</hi> unto <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.8. who hated him <hi>becauſe he never propheſyed good unto him.</hi> It ſuffers them to have no peace nor pleaſure in their great Eſtates here in this preſent World. So that it is much to be feared that many upon this account have turned their backs upon it, that ſo they may be free from thoſe gnawings, and thoſe kind of fiery doings which are ever and anon kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their inward parts by the means of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is not ſo effectual, ſo mighty in operation upon thoſe who take up this diſparaging complaint againſt it, doth not at all prove, that either it is not effectual in it ſelf, or that it is not ſo unto others; no nor yet that it is ineffectual unto them upon any ſuch terms: but that if they would remove that out of the way which maketh it ineffectual, and which hindereth the efficacy of it (which they might remove by the grace of God vouchſafed unto them) it might become as effectual unto them as it is in it ſelf, and in its own nature, and as it is unto many men in the World.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Goſpel is effectual in it ſelf (I think) we need not queſtion (and more eſpecially when opened like unto it ſelf) it is called, <hi>The power of God,</hi> or the Arm of God <hi>unto ſalvation, Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. The Word is ſaid to be quick and powerful in operation, it is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intentions of the hearts of men: This, my Brethren, is the property of the Goſpel, and of the Miniſtry thereof, when it is handled like it ſelf, and when it deſerves the name of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. But, I confeſs, the Word of God may be ſo handled that the edge and ſpiritfulneſs of it may be blunted and flatted; as when they that preach it, and undertake to open it, know not how to bring forth the mind of God in it, but ſubſtitute their own thoughts and apprehenſions inſtead thereof. The truth is, that in ſuch caſes as theſe the Word of God is but like the word of men. It is the Spirit of the Word that is ſo piercing and ſearching, and which is the diſcerner of the thoughts and intentions of the hearts of men, it is not
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:95016:220"/>the Letter of it: though we ſhould preach the jots and tittles of the Word, but then put a falſe ſenſe and interpretation on it, that will not do that great and lively execution which is proper to it; it will not rouſe the Conſcience, nor awake the ſpirits of men; but it is the mind of God, the true ſenſe and meaning of the Word conveyed and brought home to the Conciences and Underſtandings of men; this is all ſpirit and all life. <hi>The words which I ſpeak</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>they are ſpirit and life,</hi> meaning, in their true ſenſe and meaning. So that it is a clear caſe, that the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is in it ſelf a thing exceeding lively, and penetrative, and effectual; it will take mens hearts out of their bodies, and give them into their hands to ſee all that is within them; many times it poureth out it ſelf like a great flaſh of lightning, and makes men to ſee hideous ſhapes of thoughts, conceits, opinions, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions on the one hand; and allureth on the other hand to waies of holineſs and virtue by ſtrong and potent Arguments or Motives.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> That it is alſo effectual unto others appears by the great and many wonders it hath wrought in the World, by making of the Stones of the Earth Children unto <hi>Abraham:</hi> This needs no other proof but only the Teſtimony of ſo many thouſands that do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves to be brought into Captivity unto Jeſus Chriſt by the Miniſtry. The Trophies of the Goſpel are hung up in the ſight of the World in all the parts and quarters of it; it hath caſt down in men and women many a ſtrong hold, many high thoughts have been thrown down by the efficacy and power of it; it is of an undermining nature; and of the Wiſdom of the Fleſh, and of the World, which are the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that it meeteth with, and hath to encounter, in the courſe of it, (alas) it maketh <hi>ſtraw,</hi> and <hi>ſtubble,</hi> and <hi>rotten wood;</hi> it doth detect and demonſtrate the vanity and emptineſs of this Wiſdom, and maketh it evident to the Conſciences of men, that if they will follow ſuch and ſuch Principles, Notions, and Apprehenſions as they bring with them to the Goſpel they are loſt men; they miſtake the way of life and peace, and ſhall moſt certainly come to the Chambers of death, and Eternal deſtruction in the end. And as for ſuch things which it commendeth for truth, it doth ſo fortifie the truth of them upon ſuch terms of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent demonſtration, conviction, and power, that except men be deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately bent and ſet upon their own ruine and deſtruction they cannot but give place to it, and fall down before it, and ſay of a truth, this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no other but the wiſdom of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That it might have been, or yet may be as effectual unto the men we ſpeak of, if they would but remove that which obſtructeth the efficacy and power of it, is evident from many places, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.44. <hi>How can ye believe which receive honour one of another?</hi> As if he had ſaid, that if they had not reſolved that they would retain, and not caſt out
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:95016:220"/>from them that wicked and crooked humour and diſpoſition of theirs, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſeek honour one of another, to ſeek the great things of this World, and ſo to ſtrengthen themſelves in thier fleſhly intereſt this way, they might have believed as others did. This therefore was the only thing that ſtood in the way of theſe people, and was as walls and bars in the way of believing; they did divide and give out their ſtrength, in ſeeking after honour, and wealth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and as Theives uſe to do, divide parts amongſt themſelves. Now, ſo long as they were thus reſolved to ſtick together, they kept one another in their way and courſe upon ſuch terms that they could not believe: For by this means (as the Artificers ſaid of their Craft) they had their living, much of their wealth and honour came in upon the account of the credit and opinion men had of them. Now when Jeſus Chriſt did preach Doctrines contrary to the waies and policies of theſe men, which did detect their nakedneſs, and diſcover their wickedneſs, and unworthineſs, they reſolved to ſtand one by another, and defend one another, ſo that it was all one what he ſhould ſay unto them, they were bent upon their courſe. For there is nothing but if men will be wilful, they may withſtand even the efficacy of the Goſpel it ſelf.</p>
               <p>If it be here demanded, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> But is the Miniſtry you ſpeak of no more efficacious or powerful than to be obnoxious unto the reſiſtance of men? Are men able, by one means or other, to hinder the efficacy and power of it? Or is it not reaſonable to conceive that the efficacy of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſhould conſiſt as well in removing that out of the hearts and minds of men, whatſoever it be, that obſtructs the efficacy of it otherwiſe, the ſaving efficacy of it, as in any other vertue, property, and power of it whatſoever? Or if it be not efficacious enough to remove that out of mens waies which hindereth the ſaving efficacy of it, wherein is it to be eſteemed for any efficacy in it at all? If it be not effectual to ſave men, all the efficacy otherwiſe is not to be regarded. I reply,</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Miniſtry of the Goſpel cannot be conceived to be more effectual than the Holy Ghoſt, or Spirit of God; now that the Holy Ghoſt may be, and is reſiſted by men, appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. where it is ſaid, that they had <hi>alwaies reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> therefore it is very clear that the Miniſtry of the Goſpel may be reſiſted, we know that the Arm of Chriſt was the mighty Arm of God, his out-ſtretched Arm, yet the Scripture ſaith, that the unworthineſs of the people was ſuch that he could <hi>do there</hi> (namely, in his own Country) <hi>no mighty works, Mat.</hi> 13.58. <hi>Mar.</hi> 6.5. And the reaſon of this again was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not ſet their hearts upon the conſideration of ſuch things as he did, nor upon the words which he ſpake. therefore he could do no great works; that is, he had no mind or will to do them. Now when a man is unwilling to do a thing, he may (according to Scripture Dialect, and manner of ſpeaking, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9.)
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:95016:221"/>be ſaid to be unable to do it. That Chriſt could not do any great work there, was, becauſe it did (circumſtances being as they were) not ſtand with the Wiſdom by which his Will was ſteered, nor with thoſe Rules of Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, Juſtice, and Mercy by which he was acted in his whole courſe: So it is in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel; if men ſhall behave themſelves at any ſuch deſperate rate of unworthineſs, or of ſlothfulneſs, and oſcitancy, or (eſpecially) ſtubbornneſs, and ſtoutneſs of ſpirit, that they ſtill take hold of any pretenſe to oppoſe the truth that is coming upon them like an Armed man; if men (I ſay) do ſuffer themſelves in any ſuch ſtrain of Impiety and oppoſition againſt God, the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is not like to have its effect upon them, in reſpect of the beneficial end of it: it is true, the Holy Ghoſt, even when he was reſiſted, was full of power, and did vindicate himſelf very gloriouſly in the Conſciences of thoſe that did reſiſt him; and yet it is ſaid he was reſiſted, becauſe he was put by from that bleſſed work, thoſe ſaving effects, which otherwiſe he was purpoſed to have done, and to have accompliſhed: Even ſo the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, let men oppoſe it, and let men ſeek Pleas and Pretenſes to decline it, yet nevertheleſs it is full of power and authority, even over thoſe who ſhall rebel with the higheſt hand againſt it; it doth act with terrible power and conviction even upon the hearts, and ſouls, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of them, and leaves deep impreſſions of the power and glory of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The efficacy of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel doth not ſtand in the actual converſion of men, or in the actual edification of men, nor in making of men actually willing to be converted or turned unto God; for if it were to be eſtimated or meaſured by this Rule, it might rather be judged powerleſs and weak than powerful and glorious in efficacy and might; becauſe the greateſt part of thoſe who do partake of it are not effectually and ſavingly wrought upon by it, nor made actually willing to be converted. Take it in the time of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and in the times of the Apoſtles, when the Miniſtry of the Goſpel was in the heighth of its glory, the greateſt part of them that ſtood by, and were under it, remained ſtill unſubdued unto it; ſo that the efficacy of it is not to be eſtimated by the actual converſion, no, nor by the actual edification of men. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> The efficacy of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and judged of, partly, in the weightineſs or penetrating force of thoſe Arguments or Motives which it layeth before men, and preſſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſouls and conſciences to give up themſelves unto God; partly again, in the demonſtrative evidence of the reality and truth of the ſaid Arguments and Motives; partly alſo, in its diſpenſing and deriving the Divine Spirit, the Spirit of God unto thoſe who hearken diligently and ſubmit heartily unto it.</p>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:95016:221"/>
               <p>Firſt, The mighty efficacy of the Miniſtry we ſpeak of ſtands in thoſe ſtupendious, formidable, potent, and mighty Arguments, by which it urgeth, and preſſeth, and adjureth the Conſciences of men to accept of thoſe Articles or Terms of Peace and Reconciliation which the Goſpel holdeth forth, and calleth men unto. They who attempt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade unto other Studies, Practices, or Engagements of themſelves in one kind or other; as ſome endeavour to perſwade men to the ſtudy of Natural, ſome of Moral Philoſophy; others to the ſtudy of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks; others to the ſtudies of others Sciences; ſome perſwade men to good Husbandry, ſome to Marry, ſome to one Calling, ſome to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but what Subject ſoever it be, about which men treate or deal with men, or ſeek to perſwade men unto, they have no ſuch Motives or Grounds of Perſwaſion to make the hearts and minds of thoſe with whom they have to do to embrace their Motions or advice: The Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of their Warfare are but <hi>Stubble,</hi> or <hi>Straw,</hi> or <hi>rotten wood</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon; the nature of the Subjects doth not admit of any great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, or any conſiderable Arguments to perſwade unto them: Whereas the Weapons of that Warfare which the Miniſtry of the Goſpel ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nageth are ſharp as a two edged Sword; theſe are Arrows and Spears pointed with fire, that will cut thorough, and conquer the Souls and Conſciences of men; theſe will lie upon the Spirits of men, like a great mountain of Lead, that they ſhall not be able to get from under them. The Miniſtry of the Goſpel adjureth and chargeth by the love, and by the tender mercies of God, by the glory of the great things of the World to come, by the ſaving of their Souls from the Wrath and Vengeance of Eternal fire; theſe are mighty in operation, they are high and terrible, like fire in the boſome; nor can men decline the force of them, unleſs they will be Companions with the Horſe and Mule, and with the bruit Beaſt of the Field, which have no underſtanding. This is one things wherein the glorious efficacy of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel conſiſteth, and commendeth it ſelf; it hath mighty Engines and Screws whereby to manage and command the hearts and conſciences of men, and to lift them up to thoſe practices and waies whereunto it exhorteth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth them. In reſpect of the mighty efficacy and force of thoſe great Engines, Motives, and Arguments we ſpeak of, the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are employed herein, by a dexterous and faithful appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or ſetting them home to the hearts and conſciences of men, are ſaid to compel men to come in, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.23. Not that all perſons, to whom theſe Engines are faithfully applied, are removed from the World, and carried home unto God: Not that they ſhould bring them in by head and ſhoulders, whether they will or no (as ſome interpret:) but they ſhould compel, <hi>i. e.</hi> they ſhould make uſe of theſe kind of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments untill they had by an high hand of power and perſwaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with them to believe, and to come unto Chriſt,</p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:95016:222"/>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> Another thing wherein the efficacy of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is conſiderable, is, that it is furniſhed by God with demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Grounds and Arguments, whereby to ſecure the Judgements and Conſciences of men and women of the reality and truth of theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and Grounds of perſwaſion, by which it manageth and carrieth on its great deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> of bringing men from ſin, and from the World unto God. For though theſe were ſuch realities, though they had as ſubſtantial and true exiſtence and being as wither the Angels in Heaven or God himſelf, yet if this their exiſtence and being could not be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated and made out unto men; if the Miniſtry, we ſpeak of, were not accompliſhed with light to convince and ſatisfie the Judgments and Conſciences of men that the great things mentioned are no deviſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or vain Speculations and Notions, but are as real and certain in their being as things that may be ſeen, heard, or handled: I ſay, if the Miniſtry of the Goſpel did bear it ſelf upon no better terms than theſe, and were not able to make good the reality and certainty of the things which it hath aſſerted, the Conſciences of men would very eaſily deſpiſe it (as well they might do) and caſt it behind their backs. But when it ſhall prove that there is ſuch a miſery and extremity that doth abide wicked and ungodly men, that there is a fire that never goeth out, and a worm that never dieth; and that there are ſuch things laid up in the Heavens for thoſe that fear God; that there is an equality with the holy Angels, and eating of bread with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and a thouſand expreſſions more of the ſame kind: I ſay, when the Miniſtry of the Goſpel ſhall be able to fill the Judgements and Conſciences of men with a certain knowledge and conviction of the reality and exiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of ſuch things as theſe, this is that which furniſheth them with an executive power, and maketh them Motives and Arguments of ſuch a nature, that men muſt be very deſperate, and turn-head upon nature, and act contrary to their own peace, ſafety, and happineſs, otherwiſe they cannot withſtand them, nor go from them, nor riſe up againſt them; theſe Chords are too ſtrong, and bind too faſt, and cloſe, ſo that unleſs men ceaſe to be men they cannot burſt them in ſunder. It is a ſaying in the Metaphyſicks, That which is not hath no manner of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; there is the ſame reaſon in Moralities, or Moral Actions, That which is not known and apprehended hath no influence, no operation or work upon the mind or conſciences of men. And indeed, if the Miniſtry of the Goſpel were unprovided at this Point; if it were not furniſhed with weight to make the great Engines move with which it is appointed to Umpire in the hearts and conſciences of men; if it were not able to make good thoſe things which it threatneth and promiſeth; that they are Realities, and not only Notions and faint Speculations, it would do no great things, it would be but a powerleſs and faint thing: As we ſee all the deviſed and fained Stories that are abroad in the World,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:95016:222"/>though they may pleaſe the fanſies of ſome that hear them, yet they have no great work upon them, they do not move or encline them to any great undertaking. And as no man will go to the charge of building a Ship to travel to the Lands of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>topia,</hi> becauſe it is only a fained Land of pleaſure and delight, but no man was ever able to make good the being thereof: So for the glorious and great things of the World to come which are ſpoken of in the Goſpel; unleſs you can get it into mens hearts to believe that theſe things are really ſo, you may treate with them by this, and adjure them by that, and yet the Conſcience not move at all upon any ſuch account: but when it ſhall be made known to them demonſtratively that theſe great things are not words only, nor fanſies or deviſed Fables, but that they are the ſame in nature and reality which they are in terms and names; now the Conſciences of men and women are over-awed and overcome at this point, there is no ſtanding out, but only in ſuch caſes wherein men are bewitched, and have their eyes blinded by the God of this World.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) The efficacy of the Miniſtry we ſpeak of is ſeen in that, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>22</label> that it communicateth and deriveth the Spirit of God unto men, who receive and believe it. It is to be conſidered in this caſe, that it is not ſimply appointed by God to convey the Spirit of God into the hearts and ſouls of men and women; but that it is an Ordinance of ſuch a nature, that it is moſt proper for ſuch a ſervice for the great God as this, <hi>viz.</hi> the giving forth of the Spirit into the Conſciences and Souls of men, 2 <hi>cor.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Who alſo hath made us Miniſters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>not of the Letter, but of the Spirit.</hi> Gal. 3.2. <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> So that this is unqueſtionably true, that the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is erected by God for the communication of the Spirit into the hearts and ſouls of men. Even as a Conduit Pipe is a means to convey the water into our Ciſterns which before were empty: ſo the hearts, ſouls, and inward parts of the Sons and Daughters of men being to a great degree empty of the Spirit of God, God hath, as it were, made and framed theſe golden Pipes of the Miniſtry of the Goſpel to convey the Holy Ghoſt into the hearts and ſouls of men, that ſo together with him there may be life, and power, and ſtrength, and all manner of divine excellencies. This the Miniſtry of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel will certainly do when it is managed like it ſelf, and where the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and gracious Counſel of God is embraced and entertained, and men have done homage, and have bowed the knee of their Underſtanding and Judgement unto it, and have owned the things contained in it as from God. And meet it is, that ſuch a ſervice and ſubjection of the Creature unto God as this is ſhould be immediately and out of hand rewarded by him with ſo great a gift as his own Spirit. As if God ſhould ſay; Where my Advice is received, and where my Counſel goeth, there ſhall my Spirit go alſo. This (ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.39.)

               <p>We have done (at preſent) with the firſt of the ſecond ſort of Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, who were lately deſigned to Reproof, upon the account of this general Delinquency againſt the ſaid Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That inſtead of being filled with the Spirit they take a direct courſe to be emptied of the Spirit altogether. The particular Delinquency of theſe Perſons is, that they wholly withdraw themſelves from the Miniſtration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which according to the intent and declaration of the Great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it, God, is the Miniſtration of the Spirit, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> We have taken away the Weapons from them wherein they truſt, and have evinced thoſe Texts and places of Scripture, upon which they bear themſelves for the juſtification of their practice to have no manner of compliance herewith; but rather being rightly underſtood to ſtand bent a contrary way. We have likewiſe detected the inſufficiency and impertinency of ſuch other Grounds and Reaſons for their Practice, on which they chiefly inſiſt, and wherein their foot is taken and held in a ſnare of Death. The Lord break the ſnare in ſunder, and deliver their ſouls, and ſhew mercy to thoſe that are yet at liberty, that they be not led aſide into the ſame Error.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Five ſorts of Offenders more under the Second Head reproved: Firſt, Such who are chill and cool in their reſpects unto the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. An account of the Cauſes thereof: The danger of falſe Notions concerning God. A ſecond ſort reproved for withdrawing from a lively and powerful Miniſtry: Reaſons of ſuch miſcarriages. Legal and Evangelical Miniſtry diſtinguiſhed. What renders Perſons duly fitted for the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. The third ſort, juſtly reprovable, are ſuch who neglect to be led by the Spirit of God. How, and when the Spirit of God is neglected. A fourth ſort juſtly reprovable alſo are ſuch that do reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt or Spirit of God. The fifth and laſt ſort of Offenders are ſuch who refuſe to ſow unto the Spirit of God.</head>
               <p>WE proceed to a ſecond ſort (under this Head) of Offenders againſt our Doctrine, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> who together with the former are ſummoned to hear what the Spirit of God will pleaſe to ſay unto them in a way of reproof to their practice alſo, and theſe are of ſeveral ſorts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Such, who though they do not, with the former, make it matter of conſcience wholly to deſert the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, nor riſe up to plead in words againſt the bleſſing of it; yet are they chill and cool in their reſpect unto it; they do not eſteem it as their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed food, they are not zealous in their attendance on it, their hearts are not perfect with it; when they come to it, they come as if they came not, or cared not much whether they came or no, and ſo they hear as if they heard not: <hi>Sathan</hi> with a very ſlender and ſlight tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may interpoſe at any time, and ſeparate between them and their attendance upon it. We know there are many thouſands amongſt us of that lukewarm and unworthy temper we ſpeak of, who think it enough to wait upon God when he is ſpeaking the words of Eternal life by his Meſſengers, his Servants ſent unto them, when they know not well where elſe to be, or what to do; they will offer Sacrifice of that which coſt them nothing, or elſe no Sacrifice at all. Now men of this Character and frame, whoſe ſpirits ſit thus looſe to the Miniſtry of the Spirit are in this reſpect in the ſame condemnation with the former; they alſo are ſo far from obeying the voice of this heavenly Exhortation,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:95016:224"/>
                  <hi>Be ye filled with the Spirit,</hi> that they ſeem to hearken to a quite contrary ſuggeſtion, <hi>Be ye emptied of the Spirit;</hi> at leaſt to a degree. For they that are thus neutral in their attendance upon the Miniſtry of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and only hear now and then, as if they were afraid to hear too often, and ſeem to think that they have ſomewhat too much of God, or of the Spirit of God in them at the preſent, or more than is expedient to accommodate them upon the beſt terms for the enjoyment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the pleaſures and contentments of the World. And therefore, as men are wont to do when there is too much fire in the Room where they are, for the ſeaſon, and the heat beginneth to be a little troubleſome or offenſive to them, they leſſen the fire by taking off ſome of the wood that is upon it, and ſo reduce the Air in the Room to a convenient tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: In like manner, that Generation of men and women, now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cenſure, ſeem to moderate, ſtint, and limit themſelves in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance upon the Miniſtry; they will hear but now and then leſt the Spirit of God ſhould come in too faſt upon them, and they ſhould grow too hot in their ſpirits, too full of Heavenly Heat to comport with the Pleaſures, and Profits, with the Principles and waies of the World round about them, without interruption or check from their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and yet they would not be counted or ſeem to be prophane nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but would willingly keep ſome fair correſpondency with God and Chriſt, though at a diſtance: that if there be ſuch things, as the Worm that never dieth, or the Fire that never goeth our; I mean, hell and damnation on the one hand, or if there be happineſs and glory, heaven and ſalvation on the other hand, they may have ſomewhat to depend upon for an eſcape of the one, and an obtainiug of the other. And the truth is, this ſeemeth to be the ſecret policy, the deep and profound reach of the Religion of the generality, or far greater part of Profeſſours amongſt us; they project and deſign to yoke the two Worlds, that which is preſent, and that which is to come, and to make them draw together. As if <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſpoken of the two Worlds when he gave that Advice, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.18. (as our former Tranſlators read the place) <hi>It is good that thou lay hold on this: but yet withdraw not thy hand from that;</hi> and his meaning had been, that men ſhould do wifely and well to keep ſure and faſt hold of this preſent World, and yet not wholly to withdraw their minds and thoughts from that which is to come; though he ſpeaks of quite another thing (of which we ſhall not enquire at preſent:) but the Counſels and Deſigns of the hearts of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in that kind we ſpeak of, are legible in the tenour of their waies and practices, and in the diſtribution they make of themſelves between the one World and the other. To make earnings of the World that now is, men and women labour in the very fire, they riſe up early, and go to bed late, and eat the bread of much carefulneſs day after day; They that are addicted to pleaſures, and given up to voluptuous living;
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:95016:224"/>they forecaſt too to make proviſion for the fleſh, they waylay opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and means for the gratifying of themſelves in this kind; yet there is neither the one nor the other of them but will keep an eye upon that World which is to come; they will be doing ſomewhat this way though it be to little purpoſe. If Jeſus Chriſt teacheth in their Streets, when the World and their eaſe and pleaſures will give them leave they will give him the hearing. On the Lords day, when the World that now is ſtands ſtill, and the World that is to come moves and ſtirs, theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we ſpeak of will give ſome formal attendance upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, they will hear a Sermon, or perhaps two; and they think that by ſteering ſuch a courſe as this they ſhall make the Port of Heaven and Salvation, if there be any ſuch thing; or however that they ſhall eſcape the Wrath and Vengeance which is to come, in caſe there be any ſuch thing, which indeed is that which runneth moſt in their thoughts. Now, they think the loweſt and ſmalleſt degree of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Obedience will keep them from hell; and indeed it is true, a leſſer care will keep men from the penalty of the Law, whereas it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a greater engagement to do ſuch things upon which a man ſhall receive a great reward: This is only the portion of noble and excellent enterpriſes.</p>
               <p>But (I ſay) men generally do not ſo much look upon the glory which is to come, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> as that they may eſcape wrath and the vengeance of eternal fire. Now their deſign being no higher, their endeavours are according; they ſeem to imagine, that the World, that now is, is ſtiff and ſtubborn, and will not bow or turn in unto them, but by a ſtrong hand of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, care, contrivance, diligence, and circumſpection; and therefore they lay out a main proportion of their time, and much of themſelves, and the chief of their ſtrength about it; but that the World which is to come is gentle, and eaſie to be entreated, and that an Inch of care and diligence for obtaining this will go as far as ten Ells (as we uſe to ſpeak) for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the other. This, I verily believe, is the very thought and inward conceipt of the hearts of many amongſt us: Whereas the Lord Chriſt, from place to place, makes a quite contrary repreſentation of them. The <hi>Genius</hi> of the World to come, according to his Pourtraiture or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, is far the ſtiffer of the two, and harder to be entreated; and the <hi>Genius</hi> of this preſent World more facile and pliable. <hi>Firſt</hi> (ſaith he to his Diſciples, and in them to all men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33.) <hi>ſeek ye the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be caſt in unto you.</hi> The Kindgom of God; <hi>i. e.</hi> Heaven, and the ſalvation of the ſoul, theſe require ſeeking, or elſe they will not be found; yea, they require ſeeking in the firſt place [<hi>i. e.</hi> ſeeking with the many and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal intentions of the heart, mind, and ſoul] or elſe they will not be had: whereas theſe things, <hi>i. e.</hi> the conveniences of the World ſhall upon the ſeeking of the former be freely, and by way of gratuity, caſt
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:95016:225"/>in by God unto men; as that which we call the in-bread, is given into the Dozen, there is nothing properly paid or given for it, bat only for the Dozen: The Kingdom of God, the ſalvation of the ſoul, the World which is to come, are like the Dozen, he that will have this muſt pay for it, I mean, in labour and endeavours, and in looking after it: Whereas this preſent World is like unto the in-bread which will be given in by God to better the bargain. So likewiſe, when our Saviour adviſeth thus, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that which endureth to everlaſting life;</hi> he plainly gives us to underſtand, that the World which is to come requires labour of men to come by. Now, our Saviour was not of a light and unſavoury Spirit, he did not jeſt with men, he did not exhort men to ſtrain and toyl at the lifting of a Feather, no, he was moſt grave, and moſt ſober, and ſerious, and weighty in all his Counſels; therefore when he counſelleth men not to labour for that which periſheth, but for that which endureth for ever, he doth conſequently intimate unto them, that unleſs there be induſtry uſed, and much ſolicitouſneſs of mind, things of this nature will not be obtained: The Son of man, who hath theſe things to give, will not give them unto men who look not after them. And withal our Saviour doth plainly and clearly imply, that this World doth not require a like labour and diligence (at leaſt comparatively) <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, You may have ſuch meat which will ſuffice you, if you will but labour for the other. Therefore that Generation of men and women we ſpeak of greatly erre in their thoughts about the terms of the two Worlds, judging the World which is to come to be like the Fig-trees (ſpoken of by the Prophet <hi>Nahum, <hi>c.</hi> 3.12.) with their firſt-ripe Figs, which if they be but a little ſhaken fall into the mouth of the Eater:</hi> So theſe conceit that the Golden Gates of Heaven, if they be but touched with the leaſt of a mans fingers, will fly open and give him entrance; that the great things of Eternity will come upon them before they be aware; that a little time ſpent, now and then, when their eaſe and their profits will give way, will cauſe heaven and happineſs to bow down unto them; whereas their Judgment of this preſent World is, that both the inner and outer man, with their higheſt contendings, ſweatings, and ſtrainings of themſelves are all little enough, or rather too little to prevail with it to bleſs them, or give out its ſtrength unto them. It is not unlike but that the conceipt we now ſpeak of within them may be ſed with another Notion or Conceipt, <hi>viz.</hi> that the World which is to come goeth by an unchangeable Decree of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination and Election; and that Heaven is conferred upon men by virtue of a Deed of Gift, of as ancient a Date as Eternity; upon which account they act with a remiſs and cool ſpirit for the obtaining of this; expecting that the Decree of God from Eternity ſhall bring Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the bleſſedneſs of the World to come upon them, with an
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:95016:225"/>high hand, though they themſelves ſhould do nothing; whereas they have a contrary conceipt, as if God had made no Decree concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mens being wealthy and great in this World; but that all theſe things do come about by diligence and induſtry, and by a wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement of their own in this behalf: it is very likely that there is ſome touch or other of ſuch a poyſon that lieth near the root of the hearts of ſome.</p>
               <p>But to the Perſons now under reproof we ſhall (at preſent) ſay no more but this; That if <hi>Mary</hi> choſe the better part in chuſing to ſit at the feet of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to hear the words of Eternal Life from his lips, in compariſon of <hi>Martha's</hi> choice, which was to be imployed about other things (though otherwiſe, as appears, a worthy woman:) Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, ſuch perſons who neglect the opening of the Heavens, and the Viſions of the Almighty, when they deſcend upon the World, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Fleſh with eaſe, pleaſure, getting of money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> chuſe the far worſer part, which will in the end turn to a portion of everlaſting ſhame and contempt unto them if they periſh in their choice. <hi>Mary</hi> choſe a being <hi>filled with the Spirit;</hi> this was a bleſſed choice indeed; theſe men choſe a being emptied of the Spirit of God: The Day is coming like an armed man upon them, when the words which are now ſpoken in their ears will become a Sword, which will paſs through their ſouls.</p>
               <p>A ſecond ſort of Perſons againſt whom the face of the Doctrine deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered is ſet, to reprove them, are ſuch, who though they have not, as yet, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> with the Firſt of the Three, wholly forſaken the Miniſtry of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, nor ſeem with the ſecond to be but looſely and indifferently affected to it; yet they do take a courſe in a ſhort time to be emptied of the Spirit as well as either of the former; and this is by turning aſide from the Miniſtry, where it is lively, and powerful, teaching wholſome Doctrine, as Faith towards God, and Repentance from Dead Works, where it promoteth Godlineſs with an high hand, and conſequently is like to fill men and women with the Spirit of God; And turning unto, and following a Miniſtry that is like to fill them with wind and flatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent humours, with fond Notions and Conceipts, either above, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, or contrary unto that which is written. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſome, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Vainly puft up in their fleſhly minds;</hi> or irregularly puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up: Even as it is with ſome bodies that ſeem to be very fat, and full, and fair, and yet their fat is but a looſe kind of fleſh, or it may be, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſome dropſical humours, which any kind of ſickneſs will quite cancell; and commonly ſuch perſons fall into the moſt deſperate Conſumptions of all, when that looſe fat forſaketh them: Even ſo there are many looſe Profeſſors amongſt us (and have been in all Ages) who have ſwollen in their minds and conceipts into a great bul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. They judge themſelves to be like the Children of <hi>Anack</hi> in ſpiritual matters, and
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:95016:226"/>other Profeſſors about them, but as Graſhoppers, as men and women of low, and weak, and inconſiderable ſtature in reſpect of themſelves. Now there is and (for the moſt part) alwaies hath been ſuch a Miniſtry of the Goſpel (ſo called) which is apt to work this way: Though (to ſpeak properly) it is no Miniſtry of the Goſpel, but only a kind of counterfeit of it, which ſeeks to commend it ſelf unto the World for ſuch; yea, and to diſparage that which is truly and indeed ſuch in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of it ſelf: But of that Generation of men and women which forſake ſuch a Miniſtry of the Goſpel which is ſavoury, wholſome, and ſound, where the Mind and Counſel of God, concerning the peace and ſalvation of their ſouls, is effectually declared and held forth, and betake themſelves unto that which will feed their fanſies with vain and windy ſpeculations and conceipts, and let their Luſts be quiet and not diſturbe them. The great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> Propheſyed long ago, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2, 3, 4. where having moſt ſolemnly charged and adjured <hi>Timothy</hi> before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt (reminding him that it was he that ſhould judge both the quick and the dead at his appearing and Kingdom) <hi>That he preach the Word, that he be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, that he rebuke, reprove, exhort with all long ſuffering and Doctrine.</hi> He ſubjoyneth this as his reaſon why he did thus deeply adjure and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune him to lay about him in the work of the Miniſtry, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the time will come when they</hi> [<hi>i e.</hi> men and women] <hi>will not endure ſound Doctrine, but after their own</hi> [or according to their proper or private] <hi>Luſts ſhall heap to themſelves Teachers, having itching ears; and they ſhall turn away their ears from the truth, and ſhall be turned unto Fables;</hi> the time will come that they will not endure <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Doctrine</hi> that is healthful and ſound, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch a Miniſtry which is likely and proper to keep them ſpiritually healthful and ſound, free from luſts and from ſinful diſpoſitions and deſires, from erronious and fond conceipts and imaginations, which do corrupt and endanger the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conſtitution and frame of the ſoul as well as luſts and inordinate deſires themſelves do. Such a Miniſtery as this (ſaith the Apoſtle) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they will not bear or endure; it will be after a time irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, weariſome, and burthenſome unto them, as a burthen is to a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or crazie ſhoulder when it hath lain upon it long, and been carried any conſiderable way; he that beareth it will as ſoon as he can eaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of it: Now, the perſons of whom he thus Propheſyeth, that the time would come that they would <hi>not endure wholſome Doctrine,</hi> are not only the Profeſſours of Chriſtianity in that Generation wherein he wrote this, but he ſpeaketh here of a ſad diſtemper which he knew would be incident to Profeſſours in ſucceeding Ages alſo. For there is no reaſon that Chriſtians or Profeſſours of the Goſpel in <hi>Paul's</hi> time ſhould be worſe, or weaker at this turn, more apt (I mean) in time to grow weary and impatient of ſound Doctrine, and to heap up
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:95016:226"/>Teachers according to their own humours and luſts than in after Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations: Nay, of the two it is more like that Profeſſours generally in his time ſhould be leſs obnoxious or expoſed unto danger in this kind than in after Ages; becauſe the Miniſtry of the Goſpel now reigned in greater power and glory than afterwards, and ſo was more efficacious and likely to engage men and women unto it, and to the love of the truth delivered and aſſerted in it with conſtancy and perſeverance. Therefore if Profeſſours under this Miniſtry were like to miſcarry and expoſe themſelves to ruine, in ſuch a way as we ſpeak of, much more now.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why Profeſſours of Religion, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> after they have lived ſome conſiderable time under a Miniſtry able, and faithful, and ſound, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in time apt to withdraw from this Miniſtry (I mean, from this ſpecies, or kind of it, by what perſon or perſons ſoever it be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) and betake themſelves to a Miniſtry of another kind, which ſtandeth in airy Notions, and windy Speculations, in uncouth and unheard-of Strains, whether of Phraſe, or Doctrine, or both, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the reaſon, I ſay, or reaſons why men and women are apt to exchange Miniſtry for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry in this kind, are, or probably may be theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The nature of man, eſpecially when it falls in conjunction with opportunity and time, apt either to awaken or feed ſuch a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition or humour, is apt to be tempted with curioſity. I do not ſay, that in ſuch a conjunction it is alwaies overcome with this ſinful vanity; no, nor yet that it is actually ſo much as tempted by it; but this I ſay, That in ſuch a conjunction of Circumſtances as I ſpeak of, it is apt or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to be thus tempted, and by means of the temptation to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Now, that which is incident to the nature a man in ſuch or ſuch caſes, though it be not found in all men, whoſe caſe is ſo or ſo, yet it is very like to be found in many: and this is that which we now aſſign for a reaſon why many Profeſſours, who have for a time, and this (it may be) with approbation and delight, ſate under a fruitful and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Miniſtry; yet may grow after a while out of love and liking of this Miniſtry, when a Miniſtry of another kind, which vaunteth things above what is written, and which (haply) hath (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in a like caſe) a ſhew of wiſdom in it, and no more, cometh in their way. Curioſity is ſuch a diſtemper in the heart or ſoul of a man or women, which diſpoſeth it to linger and luſt after things that are rare, and which we know are enjoyed but by few; and withal are unneceſſary, and yield no benefit unto thoſe that know and enjoy them, but rather are prejudicial and hurtful unto them; for if the knowledge and enjoyment of things be really neceſſary and profitable, all things conſidered, the deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or enjoying them is no waies ſinful, and conſequently not favouring of Curioſity, but regular, and approved by God: But when men and women, in matters of Religion, and things appertaining to God, ſhall
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:95016:227"/>by degrees decline and wither in their affections towards the hearing of ſuch things which are wholſome, and ſound, and edifying in faith and love; and ſhall affect a knowing of ſpiritual things, higher, and more myſterious and ſecret than thoſe which are written and communicated by God unto the World in and by the Scriptures; and ſhall delight in the diſcourſes of ſuch men, who as the Apoſtle deſcribeth them, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>intruding themſelves into thoſe things they had not ſeen, i. e.</hi> boldly thruſting themſelves forward to teach and affirm ſuch things, of the truth and certainty whereof they have no ſubſtantial ground or bottom; this ſavours ſtrongly of that ſinful diſtemper of the ſoul which we call Curioſity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> Another reaſon of that ſad miſcarriage, we ſpeak of, in Profeſſors may be an affectation of novelty, or of change. When men and women have, for any conſiderable ſpace of time, been acquainted with, or accuſtomed unto things, or perſons, though never ſo profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and worthy, yea, and pleaſing and contentful unto them at the firſt; their affections after a while are apt to wear flat and dull, to abate and loſe their firſt vigour and ſtrength, in which caſe they are under a temptation to ſeek new Objects; and this Temptation nor being rejected, nor reſiſted as it ought to be, prevaileth over many. Thus Chriſt chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth the <hi>Jews</hi> as rejoycing (<hi>Joh.</hi> 5.35.) for a reaſon (or ſome ſhort time only) in the Miniſtry of <hi>John,</hi> notwithſtanding he was a light both <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, burning and ſhining, <hi>He was a burning and a ſhining light, and ye were willing to rejoyce in his light. John</hi> is here by our Saviour deſcribed, or commended by two properties, which in a Miniſter are moſt like to retain and keep, as well as to procure and gain the affections and approbations of men. The firſt is, That he was a burning light, ſecondly, That he was a ſhining light: Zeal accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with an excellency of knowledge are two moſt excellent and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy qualifications in the Miniſters of the Goſpel; and a man would think a Miniſter, who is provided with theſe, ſhould ſo endear the hearts of men and women whom he ſerveth in the work of the Miniſtry, that he ſhould ſo captivate their hearts and affections, that neither life nor death, nor things preſent, nor things to come ſhould be able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or to eſtrange ſuch a man from the affections of his people. Yet nevertheleſs this (we ſee) was <hi>John's</hi> caſe with the <hi>Jews:</hi> he was <hi>a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhining light;</hi> he had all the advantages that lightly could be found in a man to retain what he had gotten in the hearts and affections of his people; and yet, they who did mightly rejoyce in him for a ſeaſon, after a while ſaw no ſuch matter in him. <hi>John,</hi> who was as an Angel of God for a ſeaſon, was but like another man ſoon after; not that there was any alteration or change in <hi>John,</hi> for doubtleſs he did not decline, neither in his burning, nor in his ſhining, until the very day and hour of his death: And therefore that there was ſuch a change in
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:95016:227"/>the minds of the Jews towards him, it proceeded from the levity of ſpirit and affection which was ſo incident unto them. <hi>Ye were willing to rejoyce</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) the word (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,) ſignifieth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent degree of rejoycing, to dance and leap, or ſpring for joy; he doth not ſimply ſay, that they did rejoyce, but that they were willing to do it; that they did it freely, and of their own accord, they were not importuned by any perſwaſion or prompting by any other man: yet they had enough of <hi>John</hi> in a ſhort time, when once they had gone round about him, and ſaw his gifts and abilities, and what he was able to do; when they had taſted thoroughly of his Doctrine, they could as freely turn their backs upon him as upon any other man; they would ſee whether there were any other Teacher that was of another ſpirit, or of another method of Teaching, or whoſe Doctrine or matter was of a higher and more ſublime nature or conſideration than his. And ſo likewiſe it fared with the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and eſpecially amongſt the <hi>Galathians;</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.2. He ſaith, that though it were ſuppoſed that unto others he was not an Apoſtle, yet to them he was; meaning, that however they might think that he did not acquit or approve himſelf as an Apoſtle amongſt other people, where he preached the Goſpel, as either by working ſigns or miracles amongſt them, or by the efficacy and ſucceſs of his Doctrine in the Conſciences of many; yet certainly, he had approved himſelf both theſe waies, and every other way an Apoſtle unto them. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he in the latter part of the verſe) <hi>the ſeal of mine Apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord:</hi> meaning, that their being in Chriſt, their converſion to the Faith was a ſeal, <hi>i. e.</hi> a ſure teſtimony and confirmation unto them that he had the Commiſſion of an Apoſtle from Chriſt. And elſewhere he ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. that the ſigns of an Apoſtle were wrought amongſt them [meaning by himſelf] <hi>As in all patience, ſo in ſigns, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</hi> Elſewhere he ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>That in Chriſt Jeſus he had begotten them through the Goſpel.</hi> In another place, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>That he had eſpouſed them to one Husband, to preſent them a chaſte Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin unto Chriſt.</hi> (To paſs by much more of like import.) Such things as theſe, by which this people could not but be lifted up unto heaven (as our Saviour ſpeaks in the like caſe) were ſufficient (in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of reaſon) ſo to have endeared this Apoſtle unto them, and to have engaged them unto him, that he ſhould have been in their hearts, as he profeſſeth they were in his, even <hi>to die and to live together;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, How ſoon was this Son of the Morning, this glorious Apoſtle, and heavenly Benefactor of this people fallen in their hearts and reſpects? Other teachers, who were not worthy to looſe the lachets of his ſhooes, coming in the way, carried away the prize of their affections and eſteem from him, theſe were the men that were all in all with them, <hi>Paul</hi> was but an underling in their thoughts, a ſorry fellow
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:95016:228"/>in compariſon. After al the Signs, annd Wonders, and mighty Works that he had wrought amongſt them, after all thoſe gifts and heavenly endowments, as of Wiſdom, Knowledge, Utterance, Tongues; yet they <hi>ſought a proof of Chriſt ſpeaking in him,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.3. They could not tell whether he was ſo much as a true Miniſter of Chriſt, or no, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſhould give them a good account of it. It is ſomewhat ſtrange to think how the generality of this People, having ſuch rational foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to build themſelves ſtable and ſteady upon, ſhould yet ſink ſo low in their eſteem of him. But neither did this moſt worthy Perſon, and Apoſtle, ſpeed any whit better amongſt the <hi>Galatians</hi> than he had done amongſt the <hi>Cerinthians;</hi> he gained high reſpects and large affections; he telleth them that at his firſt coming amongſt them he was received by them <hi>as an Angel of God, and as Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> they had ſuch ſtrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon them, that <hi>they could have plucked out their eyes for him, Gal.</hi> 4.14, 15. but very quickly he became out of credit with them, and his reputation was fallen in the duſt; they cared not; they were Kings and reigned without <hi>Paul;</hi> they knew how to want his Miniſtry, and his counſel, and direction; they had found out men that pleaſed them better, they had heaped up Teachers according to their humours; they had itching ears, and therefore they muſt have ſome that would ſcratch them, and fall in with them, and pleaſe their fanſies: and thus, when they had met with ſuch Preachers and Doctors, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. which were commenſurable to their Notions, or unto that Spirit which had now taken them, theſe were the men now, and the Heirs of <hi>Paul's</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in their affections, and in the reſpects which he received from them. Yea, the Lord Chriſt, notwithſtanding that (as his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries themſelves bear him witneſs) he ſpake as never man ſpake; yea, though for a time he ſo marvelouſly affected the People, partly, with his Miracles; partly, with his Doctrine, that they were about <hi>to take him by force and make him a King,</hi> Joh. 6.15. yet was he in a ſhort time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by all the great multitude of his Hearers and Followers, none con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing with him but the Twelve only, <hi>ver.</hi> 66, 67. the reſt of them forſook the Fountain of Living Waters to drink out of narrow maddy Ciſterns; they left him who had grace powred into his Lips, who taught with authority, whoſe words were Spirit and Life, and went to theſe fooliſh blind Guides (as Chriſt terms them) the Scribes and Phariſees, to be built up unto ruine and deſtruction by them: Even as many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours amongſt us in theſe daies, after they have rejoyced for a time in the light and lively Miniſtry of ſome able and worthy Teachers, raiſed up, and ſent to them by God, they wax weary, and grow wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and they muſt have change of Teachers; although thoſe they leave and turn their backs upon be as ſhining Stars, and thoſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves unto are but as ſnuffs of Candles in Compariſon. This then is another reaſon of this unworthy and unwiſe practice of many
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:95016:228"/>Profeſſours (which oft times ſorts to a ſad iſſue) an affection of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veley, or an itching ear, as the Apoſtle calleth it.</p>

The manner of the Expreſſion intimates a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety or diverſity of fond humours and ſinful diſtempers that will be found amongſt Profeſſours, one mans conceipt running one way, another mans another way; and that every man according to his own proper humour and diſtemper [<hi>i. e.</hi> to gratifie, pleaſe, and feed his own particular luſt or humour, whatever it ſhould be] <hi>would heap up Teachers to themſelves; i. e.</hi> (I conceive) would taſte the Spirit or Doctrine of all the Teachers they could come at, untill they could meet with ſuch who were for their purpoſe; the tenour of whoſe teachings and preachings they ſhould find to be ſuch, which would not diſturbe them in their ſinful way: Or elſe, heap up Teachers, <hi>&amp;c. i. e.</hi> to cover their impatience or diſlike of ſound Doctrine, which will give no quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to their Luſts; and that it may not be thought but that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they give over hearing of ſuch or ſuch men, yet they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and good Chriſtians, and love the Miniſtry of the Word of God; they will commend and follow heaps, <hi>i. e.</hi> multitudes of other Teachers, whoſe Doctrines are more plauſible, leſs penetrating and ſearching, under which they can enjoy their luſts, whatever they be, in peace.

<pb n="430" facs="tcp:95016:229"/>according to the requirement of that uſe or ſervice for which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it: So many Teachers do form and faſhion their words, in proportion to ſuch unworthy ends as they propoſe to themſelves in their work of Teaching; which (as the Apoſtle in the paſſage before us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies) is ordinarily matter of profit or gain from their hearers. <hi>Thorough Covetouſneſs with fained words they ſhall make merchandize of you; i.e.</hi> out of a deſire and deſign to get money or matter of advantage out of you they will preach ſmooth and pleaſing things unto you, though never ſo dangerous and deſtructive unto your ſouls. <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, who eat bread at <hi>Jezebels</hi> Table, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.19. alwaies (as it ſeems) Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſyed good unto <hi>Ahab</hi> (and <hi>Jezebel;</hi>) whereas (as he complains) <hi>Micaiah,</hi> the true Prophet of the Lord, never Propheſied good, but evil to, or concerning him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 22.8. If they had not Propheſied good to <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezebel,</hi> there had been no bread on <hi>Jezebels</hi> Table for them to eat. And the truth is, that the generality of Profeſſours are not like to be ſo bountiful or free in any other caſe, for any other kind of ſervice done unto them, as in the ſtrengthening their hand in the way of their luſts and ſinful humours by a Miniſtry of the Goſpel; this they look upon as an encouragement (or diſpenſation at leaſt) from God himſelf to hold on their way: On the other hand, they are not more unwilling or loth to part ſo much as with their old Shooes, or with a morſel of bread unto any ſort of men, than unto ſuch Miniſters whoſe Doctrine they either know, or ſuſpect to be at a ſtrong or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable defiance with their Luſts, alwaies troubleſome unto, and fighting againſt thoſe Principles and Imaginations within them, upon which they bear themſelves with peace and comfort in their evil waies. They look upon ſuch Miniſters as theſe with ſuch an eye as <hi>Ahab</hi> looked upon <hi>Elijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.20. when he judged him his Enemy, <hi>Haſt thou found me O mine Enemy?</hi> And men are not apt to be liberal to their Enemies, nor unto thoſe whom they judge their Enemies.</p>
               <p>By this Argument the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> vindicated himſelf from that aſperſion which ſome falſe Teachers laid to his charge, <label type="milestone">

But how doth he prove this? By an Argument drawn from Contraries thus: They are ſo far from being
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:95016:229"/>carnal (in the ſenſe declared) that they are <hi>mighty through God,</hi> or unto God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, and caſting down imaginations,</hi> [meaning, in the minds, and hearts, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men] <hi>and every high thing,</hi> &amp;c. clearly implying, by way of Antitheſis, or Oppoſition, between Carnal Weapons and the Weapons of his Warfare, that he that goeth upon any ſuch Warfare, where he is to caſt down the imaginations of men, upon which they bear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves high in all their evil, and carnal, and ſinful waies, is not like to be accommodated by them in the fleſh; no, he will rather be looked upon as the greateſt diſturber of them in their darling Notions and Conceipts. <hi>Ahab</hi> (we heard but now) ſometime looked upon <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he called him his Enemy, <hi>Haſt thou found me O mine Enemy?</hi> If the Prophets of <hi>Baal</hi> had not Propheſied good both to <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jeze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,</hi> certainly they had not eat bread at her Table (as the Scriptures ſay they did:) they had done by them as they did by <hi>Michaiah,</hi> who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies Propheſied evil. Now whoſoever ſhall Propheſie evil unto men, as all they do who tell them plainly that if they will maintain ſuch and ſuch Principles, and hold ſuch and ſuch Notions, and walk according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they cannot be in the favour of God, nor in the way of ſalvation; Certainly, theſe men ſhall eat no bread at any mans Table whom they will not let alone in their Notions and Conceipts which are their ſtrong holds, by which they fence themſelves againſt the fear and apprehenſion of the Wrath of God. All which ſheweth, that there is a humour in men to gratifie and reward all ſuch Miniſters that will ſhew mercy unto them, and will not deal clearly with them in ſuch things. But the Apoſtles Warfare was not after the fleſh, as his and their Enemies was, who ſetting up a contrary way of Preaching unto him, and ſeeking to bring him and his Miniſtry out of credit, told the People, that <hi>Paul</hi> was a man that warred according to the fleſh, that fought himſelf here in the World, that did comply with men, to make an advantage of the Goſpel, and to ingratiate himſelf in their affections and good wills. Now the Apoſtle, to vindicate himſelf from ſuch an imputation as this, doth it upon this ground: Alas (ſaith he) I war not after the fleſh, I have no Weapon for any ſuch Battel; the Weapons of my Warfare are theſe Principles, and theſe Notions, and Truths, which I labour to preſs where-ever I come, and to ſet the World on fire with: Theſe are not carnal, but mighty unto God, or through God to caſt down ſtrong holds; his meaning is, that the proper uſe and tendency of his Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons were to encounter, and beat down, and to demoliſh thoſe thoughts and imaginations which he met withal in the minds, and in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in the hearts of men: Where-ever he came he found them as it were drunken with the Wiſdom of this World, with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions bent againſt the Goſpel, and againſt the Counſel of God therein concerning the Salvation of the World. The World was furniſhed
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:95016:230"/>with other Notions, and with other Doctrines, ſome pleaſing their fanſies in one kind, ſome in another; ſome ſaid there were many Gods, ſome ſaid there was none. Now <hi>Paul</hi> was provided with Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons (God ſtanding by him, and aiding and aſſiſting him) to combate with all theſe conceipts and imaginations of men, which were built (as they thought) as ſure as a Houſe founded upon a great Rock; ſo ſure, that they did, as it were, laugh to ſcorn any other Doctrine, or any other Principles that ſhould be brought in oppoſition unto them: But (ſaith he) the Weapons of my Warfare are mighty, even to the caſting down of ſuch things, ſuch high things as theſe. When I come amongſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and wiſe men, that think themſelves great in Wiſdom and Underſtanding, I batter and take them down from the height they are lifted up unto in their own thoughts and imaginations. The Weapons which I level againſt the faces of thoſe deſperate Counſels and lying Imaginations which were exalted within them, ſubdued them, and brought them down; yea, brought them into Captivity unto Jeſus Chriſt. Now this is that which we obſerve here, that ſuch Truths and Doctrines which are bent againſt the thoughts and conceipts of men, by which they are ſupported in their evil, ſenſual, and ſinful waies, are no weapons to fight the battels of the fleſh: but ſuch Doctrines, ſuch Notions and Imaginations which qualifie the Scriptures, and bring them down from the height of that holineſs and purity which is natural unto them, and make them to temper with men of low Spirits, and of falſe Principles; theſe are the Weapons that will fight the battels of the fleſh; and men will give large wages unto them, that by ſuch Doctrines will ſtrengthen their hands in evil waies: but they have nothing at all to reward thoſe with, that will diſturbe them in their way, which refie and ranſack their Conſciences, which take from them thoſe Weapons wherein they have truſted all the daies of their lives, and in which they have had ſo much ſolace and content. Which ſheweth that there is an inclination and longing deſire in men to be boulſtered up in their evil Notions and Practices, and to have their Conſciences fortified againſt any fear or apprehenſion of the wrath or diſpleaſure of God. So then, this is another Reaſon of that declining and falling off from ſuch a Miniſtry of the Goſpel which is burning and ſhining, which is full of Authority and Power, to a Miniſtry of quite another kind, which is airy, and ſtands partly in uncouth and empty Notions, Speculations, and Conceipts which the Scripture knoweth not, partly in affectate and odd Phraſes and Expreſſions. This is another Reaſon (I ſay) of that aptneſs in men and women to fall from the former Miniſtry to the latter; it is ſome luſt, ſome inordinacy of heart or mind, one or other, which they are not willing to part with, nor yet to be in continual fear and danger of ſuffering reproof for othem. It is true, the men of that ſolly and weakneſs we ſpeak of are wont to pretend other Reaſons
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:95016:230"/>and Grounds of that unworthy exchange they make in the caſe menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and will not own the Reaſons now ſpecified: But as the ſaying of the Poet was, <hi>Ut verae lateant cauſae, finguntur inanes.</hi> It is frequent with men, in ſuch caſes, to pretend that which is not, and to conceal and hide from the knowledge of men that which is, to make a fair co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Reaſons that are warrantable and juſt, to veil theſe that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful and unworthy, being (indeed) the true Reaſons and Grounds of their Action. This was <hi>Rachels</hi> Practice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.3, 4. the true reaſon why ſhe ſate upon the Camels Litter, or Furniture, was, that her Father <hi>Laban</hi> might not find his Images that ſhe had ſtoln; but not being willing that this Reaſon of her Poſture ſhould be known, ſhe pretends another, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Cuſtome of women was upon her. So the Scribes and Phariſees, though the devouring of Widows houſes was the real and true end they propoſed in making long Prayers, yet being loath to own this, being ſo foul and ſo unworthy, they pretended Zeal, and largeneſs of Devotion in its ſtead. Thus the Perſons we ſpeak of, being aſhamed to own the Reaſon we laſt diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and opened from the Scriptures, for the ground or reaſon of their ſhifting Miniſtries (upon the terms mentioned) are wont to pretend others of a more fair and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> import, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Miniſtry which they give over, is legal and low, (at leaſt comparatively) leſs ſpiritual, and leſs edifying (at leaſt to them:) Or elſe, that ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines or Opinions are held forth, and maintained in this Miniſtry, which are contrary to their Judgments and Conſciences; and therefore they judge themſelves bound both in Wiſdom and Conſcience to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from it, and attend upon that which is both more edifying and raiſing men up nearer unto God, and alſo more Orthodox and ſound. Theſe are common colours and pretenſes that are frequently alledged by men and women when their hearts tempt them away from a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Miniſtry to that which is unworthy. To ſpeak ſomewhat to them both.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, Whereas they impute legalneſs (as they call it) lowneſs, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> and ordinarineſs, and want of ſpiritfulneſs to the Miniſtry, under which they have no mind to continue, by reaſon whereof they cannot (they ſay) edifie or profit; it may be not unworthy conſideration, that ſuch a Doctrine or Miniſtry, which ſome count legal and low, is far more ſpiritful and raiſed than that wherein they pretend to find theſe high qualifications. For, you know, ſome call that Miniſtry legal which uregeth and preſſeth upon the Conſciences of men, with all earneſtneſs and zeal, thoſe great Duties of Mortification and Self-denial, and a thoroughneſs of ſubjection and obedience unto the whole Will of God, though otherwiſe, upon occaſion, and as oft as it judgeth it neceſſary and meet, it effectually openeth the whole Counſel of God unto men, concerning the freeneſs of his Grace, as well in their Juſtification as
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:95016:231"/>Salvation; together with all the ſecret ſtrains, and all the turnings and windings, and carriages of his Wiſdom in the Goſpel, as far as they are ordinarily reached and diſcovered by men, whereas this is the moſt Evangelical Miniſtry, and moſt likely to bring men to a true faith and belief of the Goſpel. If you would know what a legal Miniſtry is; to ſpeak properly, it is ſuch which teacheth Juſtification by the Law; and ſuch is the Doctrine of the Papiſts: But to charge, and to preſs the Commandments of Jeſus Chriſt, and to call upon men with the greateſt affection and zeal, and withall to handle ſuch great and glorious motives and encouragements, which the Goſpel affordeth unto men to ſtrengthen their hands in the waies of holineſs; and withall to lay before men the heavy Judgments which ſhall abide thoſe who ſhall be diſobedient, this is far from being legal; for it hath more of the Spirit of the Goſpel in it than any other. On the other hand, they call that a ſpiritual Miniſtry, which ſeldom or never chargeth the Souls or Conſciences of men with any Moral dutie; nor threatens theſe with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion out of the Kingdom of God, who either are Thieves, Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Covetous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But ſpendeth it ſelf, from time to time, in vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certain airy and windy Notions, and Speculations, ſuch as have no ſufficient footing or foundation either in the Scripture, or in good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; And theſe (for the moſt part) cloathed with a kind of uncouth, and antique Language and Expreſſion. This Miniſtry, when it hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained thoſe that repair unto it, for an hour or two, may, for the moſt part, truly ſay unto them, concerning what hath been delivered by it, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is reported to have ſaid, when ſome blamed him for publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and making common his Philoſophical Notions and Secrets; <hi>Edidi,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>&amp; non edidi;</hi> meaning, I have, and I have not; ſo may it be truly ſaid of ſuch a Miniſtry as we ſpeak of, it preacheth, and it preacheth not; it teacheth, and it teacheth not; for it preacheth and teacheth after ſuch a manner, that they who have heard are little the wiſer, can give no reaſonable account of any thing they hear to any ſober or intelligent man. And it is an unworthy humour or property in ſome, both men and women, to have only ſuch teachings in admiration, and in high eſteem, which they underſtand not, and to undervalue that, as low and ordinary, which they are able to make any thing of with ſenſe and underſtanding. On the other hand, It is a property, of the oppoſite extreme, in ſome others, not to value or regard any Miniſtry which requireth the uſe and exerciſe of their underſtandings to make them thorougly capable or apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the things delivered; but that only which yieldeth nothing but milk, meet only for Babes in Chriſt, or ſuch things which they knew before, and have heard ten times over. Some care for nothing that is new, though it be never ſo agreeable to their old things, I mean, to what they knew already and believed; and ſome again care for nothing but
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:95016:231"/>what is new, whether it be conſonant and conſiſtent with their old things or no: Novelty and ſtrangeneſs, in one kind or other, are ſufficient commendations of a Miniſtry in the eyes of ſome.</p>

As if he had ſaid, look, as I have done, ſo muſt ye; As I have made you to underſtand things which are new, and which you underſtood not before, by means of thoſe things which ye did know before (for all acquired knowledge is obtained by the advantage and help of things formerly known:) In like manner, every Scribe <hi>which is inſtructed unto the Kingdom of Heaven, i.e.</hi> every <hi>Miniſter,</hi> or Teacher, or Preacher of the Goſpel (as the Scribes were Teachers and Miniſters of the Law) which is <hi>inſtructed, i.e.</hi> which is duly accompliſhed and furniſhed with knowledge and underſtanding <hi>for the Kingdom of heaven, i.e.</hi> to promote and advance the intereſt and affairs of the Kingdom of heaven in the World, to propagate the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is like <hi>an Houſholder,</hi> which bringeth forth out of his Treaſury, or place of ſtore for his Proviſions, <hi>viz.</hi> for the furniſhing of his Table upon all occaſions and for the entertainment of thoſe that come to it, <hi>things both new and old, i.e.</hi> meats that have been formerly diſhed and made ready, and kept in ſtore, together with other made ready upon the preſent occaſion. But how, or wherein doth the Scribe, or Teacher ſpoken of, who is accompliſhed for the work of the Goſpel, reſemble the <hi>Houſholder</hi> here deſcribed, <hi>by bringing out of his Treaſury things both new and old?</hi> Our Saviour's meaning I conceive to be this, that it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in a worthy and well accompliſhed Miniſter of the Goſpel that he be able to bring forth, or to diſcover unto the People new things, new truths (I do not mean ſimply new, for ſo there is no truth new: but new unto them, or new unto the Age and Times wherein he liveth) and not only to do this, to bring forth new proviſions of truth, but old things, or old truths alſo, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſuch as they have already received and believed, to inſiſt upon theſe alſo; and that for this end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that he may cauſe the people to underſtand and ſee that the new truths which he brings and holds forth unto them correſpond with their old, with what they know and believe already, and have in them no repugnancy or contrariety unto thoſe, but are rather arguitively, or conſequentially contained or comprehended in them: for this properly
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:95016:232"/>is to edifie, or build up, the frequent Metaphor by which the Holy Ghoſt expreſſeth the growth or encrcaſe of men and women in ſpiritual and ſaving knowledge: To build up, I ſay, properly imports a carrying on, or carrying up that part of the edifice or houſe which is wrought or built al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eady, towards the compleating of it, by adding or laying on, according to Art, more materials fit for the building: In like manner, ſpiritual edification doth not properly ſtand in a Miniſters ſimple deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering new things, though truths, unto a people, or in their receiving or underſtanding them: But in a rational and clear connecting and cloſe joynting of theſe new truths with the old, formerly laid in their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo that people may perfectly and ſatisfyingly perceive the perfect harmony and conſent between what they hear anew, and what they have been grounded upon before: So that that which is newly added unto them may not ſtand off from, or ſtand awry by the former part of their building; but every way correſpond with it, yea, be ſupported and maintained by it. When a houſe is part built, and part unbuilt (which is the caſe of all Chriſtians in this life) to throw down an heap of new brick, or ſtones, or pieces of timber, though never ſo fit for building, by the ſides of the Wall that is a building, is not to build, or carry on the building of the houſe, but a regular diſpoſing of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and upon that which is already built, that ſo they may be incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated together, and one receive ſtrength and firmneſs from the other, this is in order towards the compleating of the building: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for a Miniſter, or Teacher, only to teach new matter to a people, though it be nothing but truth, and to neglect their old things; I mean, not to ſhew them, and to make them ſee and underſtand the perfect coherence of this new matter with, and dependence upon what they know already, and firmly believe, is not the part of a Scribe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed for the Kingdom of Heaven, nor properly to edifie men in their moſt holy Faith. The truth is, that they that have but a little knowledge, and actually underſtand or apprehend only a few Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of truth, and theſe of the eaſieſt and plaineſt kind, have yet vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, and as contained in theſe a great variety and excellency of knowledge; and it is a ſpecial part of the work of a Miniſtry, by the light of the Scriptures, to unfold theſe Principles unto men, and to make them ſee how that all that God requireth of them in his Word, either to do, or to believe, was written, though with a ſmall Character, and this much defaced, and ſo hardly legible without help in the Tables of their own hearts and conſciences. But this only by the way.</p>
               <p>The thing we drive at, is, to make known unto you, that that Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of men now under reproof for forſaking the Miniſtry where it is ſolid and fruitful, for ſuch a Miniſtry which fetcheth all the Notions and Doctrines of it from <hi>terra incognita:</hi> From beyond, or above the Scriptures under a pretenſe that the former Miniſtry is low, and they
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:95016:232"/>cannot edifie by it; they, I ſay; plainly ſhew by this pretenſe, that they do not know what belongs to true and ſolid edification. This doth not conſiſt (as we have ſhewed) in having new things taught us, much leſs ſuch new things, which are empty Speculations, and have no ſubſtance or weight of truth in them: but in having new things ſo taught us, that their agreement and good accord with our old things, being truths, may be evidenced unto us; in which reſpect our old things muſt be inſiſted upon, and made uſe of, more or leſs, in order to our edification. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances are near at hand, and might readily be given, if I judged it needful, that God is juſt, infinitely juſt, that he is infinitely gracious, merciful, wiſe, powerful, faithful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are (I ſuppoſe) old things with us, that we have oft heard preached unto us; and few (I preſume) there are amongſt us but believe them: Now, that Miniſtry that ſhall edifie us muſt not teach us things inconſiſtent with, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto theſe, or any of theſe, but ſuch which have a rational and kindly ſympathy and agreement with theſe, and their fellows. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he that will edifie a people muſt not only teach things that are conſequential unto theſe, but he muſt alſo make it evident unto them how they are conſiſtent, and how they do correſpond with their old truths. Whoſoever doth thus may be ſaid truly and properly to build up men and women. As the laying on brick or timber upon that which is already built is properly to build up: Even ſo, when perſons are ſhewn, and it is made evident unto them that theſe new truths are no other than what they have already received, and what they have already believed, when they can reduce them, though never ſo ſpiritual, to thoſe old things, and ſee how conſiſtent theſe are with them, then are theſe perſons properly ſaid to be edified. For, my Brethren, this is moſt certain, that even in thoſe old things. <hi>viz.</hi> that God is Merciful, Gracious, and Good, and Juſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all high Notions contained as in the bowels of them; and that Miniſtry is moſt edifying that can draw out things that are moſt myſterious, and that are moſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly; and yet can draw them out ſo, as that the hearers may ſee and perceive, upon the minding and narrow conſiderations of them, that ſurely theſe things are ſo and ſo becauſe they have ſo clear and happy a conſiſtency with thoſe things which they do believe already.</p>
               <p>But what may be the Reaſon why the men and women we ſpeak of, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> ſhould think they edifie by ſuch a kind of Miniſtry, as their hearts are now lift up unto, and could not edifie by the other which they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake? I reply.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The reaſon why they think they edifie by their new Miniſtry, is, either becauſe they meet with new and ſtrange terms, uncouth phraſes, and expreſſions which they had not learned or heard of before; or elſe for want of skill, but chiefly for want of will, care, and deſire
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:95016:233"/>to compare the ſubſtance of the matter which is delivered unto them in ſuch new and ſtrange Phraſes and antique kind of Language, with what they had learned before, they conceive that, behold, now all things are become new; now we are enlightned, now we ſee and underſtand things that never entred into our thoughts or minds before; whereas the truth is, the matter that many times lieth under theſe new and uncouth Phraſes and Expreſſions is but one and the ſelf-ſame thing with that which they did underſtand and know before: and they themſelves might diſcover as much if they did but weigh and compare the words and phraſes, and what is imported in them. As for inſtance, the plain Doctrine of Mortification and Self-denial; it is very ſtrange to hear how, and in what kind of habit they do adorn theſe Doctrines which are plain, and wholſome, and ſound. They put them into a new kind of expreſſion that was not ſeen nor heard of before, nor declared by thoſe Miniſters who are ſound and ſincere in their teaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. It is in this caſe only as if a man ſhould meet an old friend of his with a new Suite on his back of an antique and uncouth faſhion, which he was never ſeen or known to be in before, in ſuch a caſe as this one would think him to be a new man, and ſome ſtranger: So theſe men if they have but their old matter put into a new garbe of expreſſion, they are pleaſed, and think they have heard excellent Notions, and ſuch things as they never did hear before.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Reaſon hereof ſeemeth to be this, becauſe they received diſtaſte and diſlike upon the account formerly mentioned; namely, that this Miniſtry is not for their turn, it will not ſerve their luſts, and the waies wherein they deſire to walk. Now upon ſuch an occaſion as this is, beginning to conceive a diſtaſte, thenceforth they do gather from day to day, and from time to time, all matters which have any colour of diſlike in them; and if they can put any unworthy ſenſe, and interpretation upon any Paſſage or Doctrine that is delivered by ſuch Teachers, all this is put to that account; namely, to ſtrengthen their own hands and hearts to forſake them, and to quit themſelves of them; as it is with a ſide of a houſe which begins to ſettle, all the weight of the houſe cometh that way: So if the credit or authority of a Miniſtry do but begin a little to fall, in the minds of men, then all the weight of their infirmities who manage it, or any thing in them that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to look like weakneſs or miſcarriage will be laid upon it: and ſo in a ſhort time men will work themſelves to a perfect liberty, and thoughts will be made that this is not a Miniſtry for them; and that their ſoul is not like to proſper under it, and therefore they will ſeek where it may be better with them.</p>
               <p>Again, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> Whereas the perſons under reproof frequently charge that kind of Miniſtry which they forſake with being a legal Miniſtry. I reply:</p>
               <pb n="439" facs="tcp:95016:233"/>
               <p>That (I verily believe) that they who thus pretend either know not, or conſider not what they ſpeak herein; for I would gladly know of them what they mean by a legal Miniſtry. Is not their ſenſe and notion of a legal Miniſtry this, <hi>viz.</hi> to be frequent and zealous in preſſing men to keep the Law, to obey the Will and Commands of God, and to threaten with wrath and the vengeance of hell fire, <hi>the Children of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and thoſe that ſhall walk after the fleſh,</hi> and to promiſe the love and favour of God to the exact obſervers of his Law? But if ſuch a Miniſtry as this be legal, what Miniſtry can be more legal than that exerciſed by the Lord Chriſt himſelf, and his greateſt Apoſtles, both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c? What Miniſter did ever preſs holineſs, or the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties required of men in the Law more ſtrictly, more zealouſly, with greater authority and power than he? Whoever threatned Tranſgreſſors with greater ſeverity and dread than he in that moſt excellent diſcourſe (a Sermon of his, as it is called) upon the Mount? (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.) How doth he all along command and preſs the obſervation of the Law, and the things contained in it? The eight Beatitudes (as they are commonly called) what are they but a preſſing by motives of weight certain duties contained in the Law? As <hi>bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth; bleſſed are the merciful,</hi> &amp;c. Now all theſe are expreſs duties contained in the Law, and yet we ſee our Saviour commends them unto his Hearers by the great motives of bleſſedneſs which ſhall attend thoſe who ſhall perform them. And in <hi>ver.</hi> 17. and many paſſages of that Chapter, we find that the Lord Chriſt is very full and high in calling upon men for the duties of the Law; <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets; I am not come to deſtroy, but to fulfil;</hi> meaning, in his own Perſon firſt, and then to fulfill them likewiſe by his Doctrine, and by the charge which he would leave with his Apoſtles, and by them derive to all his Miniſters and Agents to the worlds end. So in <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>Whoſoever therefore ſhall break one of the leaſt of theſe Commandments, and ſhall teach men ſo to do, he ſhall be accounted leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But towards the end and concluſion of this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.21. ſee with what mighty authority and force doth he impoſe upon men the keeping of the Law, <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in heaven;</hi> which holy and perfect will of God is comprehended and laid down in the Law, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will ſay unto me in that day, Lord, have we not Propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out Devils?</hi> &amp;c. Yet (ſaith he <hi>ver.</hi> 23.) <hi>I will profeſs unto them I never knew them; depart from me ye that work iniquity.</hi> So that from this, and many ſuch like Paſſages it is evident, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was a great Exacter and Perſwader, a conſtant Urger and Preſſer of the Conſciences of men unto holineſs, and unto the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Law. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.27. he declares that he will reward
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:95016:234"/>every man according to his works. And <hi>Chap.</hi> 23. he pronounceth woe upon woe, and heaps of woes againſt the Scribes and Phariſees for their miſdemeanours, and tranſgreſſion of the Law in their Places and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Yea, after his Reſurrection, being now ready to leave the World, and to aſcend up into heaven, when he delivered the ſum and ſubſtance of the Goſpel unto the Apoſtles, as that which was to be the ſubject matter of their Preaching; one part of it was Minatory, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Curſe of the Law; yea, it containeth a ſorer and far more grievous curſe than that which the Law denounceth, <hi>He that believeth not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be damned,</hi> Mar. 16.16. This damnation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is a thouſand times more dreadful than the Curſe or damnation of the Law, and this in two reſpects:</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is irreverſible when once it hath ſeized upon a perſon, whereas the Curſe of the Law, when a man hath incurred it, may be taken from him by the grace of the Goſpel. Every man that doth not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent believe, is under the Curſe of the Law; but under the Curſe of the Goſpel he only is that dieth in his unbelief: For when it is ſaid, <hi>But he that believeth not ſhall be damned;</hi> The meaning cannot be, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not at preſent an actual believer ſhall be damned, but he that dieth in unbelief.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly, The Curſe of the Goſpel is much more grievous than the Curſe of the Law, in reſpect of the great weight or degree of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which accompanieth it when it falls upon the Creature. The Curſe of the Law where it falls it will break in pieces: but the Curſe of the Goſpel will grind all to powder. The Apoſtle implyeth ſuch a difference as this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the Miniſtry of the Lord Chriſt was moſt purely and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarily Evangelical, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> and therefore far from Legal, yet preſſed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Moral Law in all points with the greateſt exactneſs and ſeverity that might be; yea, and threatned the vengeance of hell fire in caſe of neglect and diſobedience. Such was the Miniſtry of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo: How frequent and fervent is he in all his Epiſtles in perſwading, and preſſing, and urging men unto every good way and work? Yea, how diſtrict and terrible is he in his threatnings of the loſs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and Salvation it ſelf? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. (We ſee there how cloſe he bindeth the duties of the Law,) <hi>Know ye not that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous ſhall not inherite the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived,</hi> &amp;c, My Brethren, what Miniſter (if you call that legal in a Miniſter) did ever urge and preſs the duties of the Law upon higher terms than this Apoſtle did? If you make but obſervation you ſhall find throughout all his Writings this was a frequent vein of his Miniſtry, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20, 21. <hi>Now the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe, Adultery, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>But Fornication, and all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs;</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:95016:234"/>
                  <hi>let it not be ſo much as once named amongſt you; know you not that no Whoremonger, nor Idolater, nor Adulterer, nor Unclean perſon ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the Kingdom of Heaven? Let no man deceive you with vain words,</hi> making you believe that you ſhall come off at laſt; Why? <hi>For,</hi> or <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God, i. e.</hi> cometh in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Tenſe, as if it were ready to fall on them the ſame hour and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And again the like place, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. So that it is evident, from theſe Paſſages out of this Apoſtle, that his Writings are full of this Spirit; namely, to preſs the duties of the Law of God upon the Conſciences of men, to fill, if it were poſſible, their hearts, and ſo their lives, with the obſervation of them. The Miniſtry of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo was of the ſame ſtrain with the two former, ſtrongly bent to fill the hearts and lives of men with righteouſneſs and true holineſs, and this by threatning Judgments and Wrath againſt the Diſobedient, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18. <hi>If Judgment begin at the Houſe of God; What ſhall the end be of them that obey not the Goſpel of God? And if the Righteous ſcarcely be ſaved, where ſhall the Ungodly and Sinner appear?</hi> It is a very terrible kind of expreſſion, and repreſenteth the ſtate of the ungodly and wicked to be ſuch as that no wit of man, no, nor all the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were capable of caſting up all the horrour or terrour which will befall them. And ſo again, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5, 6. <hi>For if God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and made them an enſample unto thoſe that after ſhould live ungodly.</hi> If God had only threatned theſe, namely, the Angels, and thoſe wicked men, the Inhabitants of the Old World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but had never done execution according to the tenour of his threatnings, men might have thought that he had only threatned men to keep them in awe, and no more. But ſuch examples as theſe, ſhew, that when God doth threaten, he doubtleſs doth it not in vain, only to threaten; but will do execution according to his threatning, in caſe men continue in their ſinful waies. So that there is no ground to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine a Miniſtry to be legal becauſe the bent and face of it is ſet, as it were, to preſs men to the keeping of the Commands of God contained in the Moral Law; nor becauſe it threatneth with the greateſt ſeverity, and with the vengeance of hell fire, them that ſhall neglect any of his Commands; it may be excellent and highly Evangelical notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. That which is pretended, that it (namely, the Law) ſhould not be preſſed upon men, becauſe <hi>they are not under the Law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6.14. &amp; 8.2. is of no force. For the natural conſcience in men doth dictate unto them, and urge upon them the performance of thoſe very duties which the Law of God doth require; and therefore it is not material to inſiſt here upon this queſtion, Whether Believers
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:95016:235"/>are bound to obſerve the Moral Law, as it was delivered unto the <hi>Jews?</hi> for it is unqueſtionable, that the things contained in this Law are binding upon them otherwiſe (as the Apoſtle doth diſtinguiſh very accurately and carefully in that caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15.) He doth not ſay, that the Gentiles did ſubject themſelves to <hi>Moſes Law,</hi> as it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered unto the Jews; but they did the things contained in the Law: So if Believers be bound to do thoſe duties in every reſpect which the Law requireth. This we may call a ſubjection to the Law.</p>
               <p>Nor yet again is it any Character or property of a Legal Miniſtry (if we take the word Legal in any diſparaging ſenſe) to promiſe the Love and Favour of God, Life and Salvation, to thoſe that ſhall be found the exacteſt obſervers of the things required by God in the Law (in the Moral Law) eſpecially if ſuch obedience proceed from that Faith which worketh by Love; for the Miniſtry both of the Lord Chriſt (and ſo of the two Apoſtles mentioned) made many Promiſes upon theſe terms (<hi>viz.</hi> upon keeping of theſe Commandments.) All, or the greateſt part of the Beatitudes (as they are called) pronounced by our Saviour in the entrance upon his Sermon on the Mount (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. of which we lately ſpake) are but ſo many Promiſes made unto perſons duly obſervant of things commanded in the Law. As when he ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are the Meck, bleſſed are the Merciful, bleſſed are the Peace-makers,</hi> &amp;c. Now Meekneſs, Mercifulneſs, and Peace-making, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are holy diſpoſitions with their proper fruits and actions commanded in the Law. So again, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.10. <hi>If ye keep my Commandments, ye ſhall continue in my love; even as I have kept my Fathers Commandments, and abide in his love.</hi> Now his Commandments are no other but the very ſelf-ſame things which are commanded in the Law of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments, i. e.</hi> that hath them in his mind, in his life and converſation, <hi>he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him,</hi> &amp;c. So that ſtill we ſee that the Promiſes are made unto the fulfilling of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7, 10. where the Apoſtle (ſpeaking of God) ſaith, that he will <hi>render to every man according to his deeds; to them who by patient continuance in well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> by keeping the Commands of God) <hi>ſeek for glory, and honour, and immortality, eternal life: but to them that are contentious,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and wrath.</hi> By ſuch Paſſages as theſe it doth evidently appear, that both the Miniſtry of the Lord Chriſt, and of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> was full of theſe Promiſes unto moral qualifications, or unto obedience unto the Law. Thus then we ſee, that a Miniſtry is not to be termed Legal in any reprovable ſenſe, upon the account of any the three proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties mentioned; nor yet upon the account of them all, though concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in one and the ſame Miniſtry: as (indeed) they ought, yea, and muſt, if they will be faithful, and are like to edifie men in faith and holineſs.</p>
               <pb n="443" facs="tcp:95016:235"/>
               <p>Very like it is, that the perſons, now under cenſure, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> do ignorantly aſperſe that Miniſtry as Legal, againſt which they ſeek a quarrel, upon the pretenſe of one or other, or all the three particulars ſpecified: But the Miniſtry that deſerves that imputation of being Legal (to add this briefly by the way) is, firſt, and moſt properly, ſuch which teacheth Juſtification, <hi>i. e.</hi> Remiſſion of ſins by Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the merit of Works; for otherwiſe Faith is a Work, and ſo called by our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. But to Preach Juſtification by Faith is not to Preach Legally, but moſt Evangelically: For that was the Maſter vein of the Miniſtry of <hi>Paul, viz.</hi> to avouch and prove that Juſtification was to be obtained by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt; whereas they (the Jews) held, that it was to be obtained by obſerving and keeping the Law. Now though to Preach Juſtification by Faith alone (as was even now ſaid) be not to Preach Legally, but Evangelically; yet, to Preach it by Faith, <hi>ſenſu meritorio,</hi> as if Faith, were the meritorious cauſe of Juſtification, is either to Preach Legally, or upon an account every whit as bad, and as repugnant to the tenour of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Miniſtry may (in a ſenſe) be termed Legal, which, like unto <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Taskmaſters in their hard dealings by the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> exacteth the full Tale of Brick from men, yet gives them no ſtraw whereof to make them; I mean, which is continually (in a manner) preſſing men unto duties, yea, the hardeſt of duties, binding the heavie burthens of the Law upon the Conſciences of men with the Iron bands of ſharp reproofs, and ſore threatnings; ſeldom or never miniſtring unto them the rich and high encouragements of the Goſpel, whereby both their hearts and hands might be ſtrengthened, and all that which is diſtaſteful to the fleſh, in ſuch works and waies, be drowned and taken away. They that require of men to do Angels work, (I mean, do high and excellent ſervices to God) ſhould feed them with the food of Angels; they had need have the higheſt encouragements, even ſuch as are in the Goſpel. They that require of men to be as fruitful, and as zealous, in ſerving God and men, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, who laboured to promote the intereſt of God and men, <hi>more abundantly than they all</hi> (as himſelf ſaith) they muſt endeavour to lift them up higher, as high as the third heaven: for there (doubtleſs) it was that <hi>Paul</hi> learned that noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, greatneſs, and worthineſs of ſpirit; there he learned to act after another manner of Rate than all the men of the World beſides, who never came there as he had done. The way to draw out mens hearts and ſouls, and all that is within them, in ſerving God and men, doing good to their Generation, is as far as poſſible to raiſe in them the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Goſpel, then ſhall you bring the World under your feet; and when that ſhall be under your feet, then ſhall you be able to lift up your hands to any of the Commands of God: But untill men are full of the hope of the life, and glory, and great things of the World which
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:95016:236"/>is to come, every good work and way will ſtick with them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with their ſouls and ſpirits; whereas give men but felicity enough, and then if their eyes will do you any ſervice, they will pluck them out and give them unto you. But this only by the way, to give a little light whereby to eſtimate a legal Miniſtry, which is a Word or Phraſe uſed by many, but rightly underſtood by very few.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Such a Miniſtry may be termed Legal which ſendeth men forth about their ſpiritual buſineſs in their own ſtrength, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming them, and that plainly, that without Jeſus and his Spirit they can do nothing. For the gift of the Spirit unto men, and ſo alſo the Doctrine of Prayer, upon which God doth convey his Spirit, is Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical. <hi>Received you the Spirit by the hearing of the Law?</hi> &amp;c. therefore they who teach men that they have no need of the Spirit, or of the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aſſiſtance thereof; but that they may do things in their own ſtrength are, in a ſenſe, Anti-Evangelical Teachers.</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) That Miniſtry alſo may not unproperly be called Legal, which bindeth over to Condemnation, where the Goſpel doth not; that concludeth or ſhutteth men up under Sin and Wrath, where the Goſpel doth not; or that ſhall make any ſtricter bands of Condemnation than the Goſpel doth, <hi>viz.</hi> They who ſhall determine the ſtate of thoſe men, who hold that Chriſt died for all men, that theſe cannot be in a ſtate of Grace (though this be a moſt plain and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Doctrine of the Scripture) and ſo they that teach and threaten men and women that they ſhall never receive Remiſſion of ſins, and conſequently ſhall not be ſaved, unleſs they be twice baptized: now here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they bind men over unto death upon ſuch terms that the Goſpel doth not allow of; therefore ſuch a Miniſtry which teacheth ſuch things as theſe, is a legal Miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Again, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> Whereas the perſons, yet under reproof, are wont to pretend likewiſe <hi>lowneſs</hi> and ordinarineſs of matter, or of teaching, in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry which they have a mind to quit, as one Reaſon of their with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from it. It is more than to be feared, that they know not what the deficiency in a Miniſtry, which they call <hi>lowneſs,</hi> meaneth, this being a more palpable pretenſe than either of the other. For by <hi>lowneſs,</hi> I ſuppoſe, they mean, the preſſing and teaching of common, and ordinary, and known duties; as of Love, Mercy, Patience, Faith, Temperance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas the truth is, that the teaching and preſſing of theſe duties, upon ſuch terms as they may and ought to be taught, and preſſed upon the Conſciences of men, argues an excellency of power and of faithfulneſs in a Miniſtry, yea, is the glory of it. For wherein can it reaſonably be conceived that the worth and glory of a Miniſtry ſhould conſiſt, but in repairing the decayed Image of God in men, and in preparing and making men meet for a heavenly Kingdom? Now
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:95016:236"/>wherein doth the Image of God we ſpeak of in men ſtand, but in the accompliſhing and perfecting the Creature for all actions and ſervices re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating unto it, and proper for it to perform? As God is moſt abſolutely and every way accompliſhed, and that upon the higheſt terms of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for the acting of all things which are proper for him to do. So likewiſe, to put men into a rich and divine-like capacity this way; that is, to furniſh them with all principles, and diſpoſitions, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all things fit for them to do; ſo that nothing may lie between them and the performance of their duty but their own will; this is to raiſe up the Image of God in men. Or if you place this Image of God in men in righteouſneſs and true holineſs it cometh but to the ſame; for that is a right Miniſtry indeed which hath force to raiſe men up unto theſe, eſpecially, in ſuch meaſures and degrees as they ought to be found in men, and can qualifie men fully for their duty and ſervice, as the performance of theſe do for their reward and glory. Therefore that Miniſtry which preacheth and preſſeth the duties of Faith, Love, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon men, ſo as really to enrich and fill the hearts and ſouls of men and women with them is no low Miniſtry, but a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of power and great glory. And thus we have done with the ſecond ſort of Offenders againſt the Doctrine delivered under the ſecond Head The folly of their Delinquency was, that they turned their backs upon wholſome and ſound teaching; ſuch wherein the Spirit of God delights to go forth, and ſate down under ſuch teachings which do little more than beat the Air, and which the Spirit of God knoweth not.</p>
               <p>There is yet a third ſort of Offenders againſt the Apoſtles Exhortation, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> and the Doctrine delivered from it (who may be ranged alſo under the Second Head, as being perſons running a courſe not to be filled with the Spirit, but on the contrary, to be emptied of him.) Theſe are ſuch who refuſe or neglect to be led by the Spirit; who either do not mind, or take knowledge of the leadings or motions of the Spirit; do not bend the ear of the inward man to him when he ſecretly ſpeaketh; or elſe (that which is as bad, or rather worſe) when they do hear him, or are ſenſible of his motions or leadings within them, yet turn aſide from him, and go their own way. Such undue and unworthy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages as theſe in men towards the Spirit of God, muſt of neceſſity grieve him, and conſequently occaſion him to depart, or withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from them.</p>
               <p>For the former: Are not the generality, or far greater part of men and women, altogether neglective of all that is acted or done by the Spirit of God within them? Yea, Are there not many that are ignorant whether there be any Holy Ghoſt, any Spirit of God within them, yea, or no? Yea, many that have ſome belief (it may be) that the Spirit, we now ſpeak of, may be in them, who yet are ignorant, and know
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:95016:237"/>not whether he doth any thing in one kind or other within them; whether he moveth, enclineth, leadeth, or perſwadeth one way or other in them or no? If you ask me, But can the Spirit move or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline any perſon, and yet this perſon not be moved or enclined by him? Or if they be moved or enclined by him, can they be ignorant of it, muſt they not needs know it? I reply:</p>
               <p>Firſt, To the former of theſe queſtions, That a Perſon may be ſaid to be moved or enclined two waies, or in a twofold ſenſe: Firſt, He may be ſaid to be moved or enclined when that is done unto him which is apt, and proper, and ſufficient to cauſe him to be moved and enclined, whether he be actually moved or enclined or no.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He may be ſaid, and that in the more obvious ſenſe of the two, to be moved, when that force which is put to him, to move and encline him, proſpereth to that end for which it is employed; that is, when the perſon moved, doth as it were fall before the enclination, and doth yield unto that which he is ſtirred, and moved, and enclined unto. In the former ſenſe a man or woman may be ſaid to be moved, perſwaded, or led by the Spirit, this way or that, unto this courſe or that, and yet not be brought or prevailed with to walk in thoſe waies. Thus the goodneſs of God is ſaid <hi>to lead men unto Repentance,</hi> Rom. 2.4. who yet are not prevailed with to repent. So when the Scriptures (ſpeaking of the Jews) ſaith, <hi>That they reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> it is plainly implied:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That they were (in a ſenſe, which muſt needs be the ſenſe we now ſpeak of) led by the Spirit of God [<hi>i. e.</hi> were perſwaded, moved, and enclined by him] unto waies and practices that were holy and good; for otherwiſe how could they be ſaid to have <hi>reſiſted</hi> him? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance cannot be but only where there is ſome attempt or aſſault made; therefore certainly when they did reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, the Holy Ghoſt did attempt upon their hearts and conſciences to perſwade them unto that which was right and pleaſing in the ſight of God. Again,</p>
               <p>Secondly, It implies, that they were not perſwaded [I mean, with ſucceſs, or ſo as to be prevailed with] to walk in thoſe good waies whereunto the Holy Ghoſt did encline them. In a like ſenſe (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8.) ſome men are ſaid to <hi>reſiſt</hi> the Truth. When Truth is preached and declared unto men, eſpecially, when with power, and authority, and with ſtrength of conviction it doth aſſault or attempt their Judgments and Conſciences, to ſubdue and ſubject them unto it ſelf; and men on the other hand ſtrengthen themſelves by pretenſes, or fleſhly conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not to ſubmit to it, not to acknowledge it, then are they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to reſiſt it. In a like Phraſe or conſtruction of Speech <hi>Iſrael</hi> is ſaid to have been purged, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>In thy filthineſs is lewdneſs, becauſe I have purged thee and thou waſt not purged, therefore,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:95016:237"/>Thus then you ſee how, and in what ſenſe a perſon may be ſaid to be led by the Spirit of God, and yet not to be led by him: Even as God may be ſaid to work in men <hi>both to will and to do,</hi> and yet men neither will nor-do, as is clearly ſuppoſed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. upon a like accompt alſo, <hi>Moſes</hi> [or rather God himſelf] ſuppoſeth that he [<hi>i. e.</hi> God] ſanctified men, yet men were not ſanctified, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.7, 8. This for reply to the firſt demand propounded.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond I reply, That men may be led, moved, or enclined by the Holy Ghoſt in both ſenſes now explained, but eſpecially in the former, and yet be ignorant of it; I mean, by whom they are led, moved, or enclined. In the former ſenſe of the Phraſe being <hi>led,</hi> a man or woman may be ignorant when they are <hi>led</hi> by the Holy Ghoſt upon this account, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they do not know, are not acquainted with the movings or leadings of the Spirit of God; they underſtand not whence ſuch leadings or motions unto good, which at any time are ſtirring in them, come: As <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.5, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. when young, did not know the voice of God when he ſpake unto him, but thought it had been <hi>Eli:</hi> Now this ignorance, in men and women is generally occaſioned by a ſlothful, careleſs, and prophane diſpoſition, wherewith they commonly ſuffer their hearts to be overgrown, untill in a manner they become inſenſible of it. Men do not remember their <hi>Creator in the daies of their youth</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> advizeth them to do, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.1.) they do not enquire or ſeek after God (as the Scripture ſpeaketh:) They do not care to acquaint themſelves with him (as <hi>Eliphas,</hi> Job 22.21.) and ſo by degrees there grows a greater and greater diſtance between God and them, untill they have quite forgotten him, and loſt all thoſe bleſſed impreſſions of his Nature and Attributes which were implanted in them: And when things are at this paſs, the Holy Ghoſt may ſtir and move within them, unto waies and works that are good and worthy, from day to day, and yet they remain ignorant from whence ſuch motions come, or whither they go. They (it's like) conceive they come there by accident or chance, as Birds come flying through the air by them; or that they ſpring out of their fanſies and imaginations, as waters bubble and ſpring out of the earth; but that the bleſſed Spirit of God ſhould be their Author or Parent is not to be found amongſt all their thoughts. Beſides, to many of thoſe leadings and movings of the Spirit of God within them, and theſe of the greateſt weight and moment; it is like that the greateſt part of people know not, apprehend not, that they are ſo much as good, or Worthy of God: How then ſhould they believe them to be from the Spirit of God? As when men find or feel any impulſes or beatings upon their hearts or ſpirits to turn <hi>Puritans</hi> (as the Phraſe was formerly) or to joyn themſelves in the Companies and Societies of men and women fearing God; to refrain from their former vain companies or waies; they conſtrue ſuch motions as theſe, as temptations or
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:95016:238"/>inſinuations of Sathan, and not the motions and inſinuations of the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>In the latter ſenſe of the Phraſe, being <hi>led, viz.</hi> when men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men actually go, as, and whither they are led, they may be ignorant when they are led by the Spirit of God, <hi>viz.</hi> when they do things that are worthy and good, and yet act with ſome regret or heſitancy of mind, whether theſe things they do be good or no. Or (poſſibly) they may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the inward motions, by which they were led unto ſuch actions or waies as we now ſpeak of, were but the workings of their Conſciences, the Dictates and Suggeſtions of their natural Conſciences. But we have no occaſion to ſpeak any further of this at preſent; that which we have now to do, is, in the name of God, and of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to expoſtulate the caſe with ſuch perſons (in order to their own eternal peace and ſafety) who inſtead of laying out themſelves upon ſuch terms as that they may be filled with the Spirit of God, run counter (as it were) to ſuch a courſe; and by neglecting to be led by the Spirit of God take a courſe to be deſerted by him, and ſo empty themſelves of him.</p>
               <p>Now to open a little further the ſinfulneſs and danger of ſuch a courſe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> as we ſpeak of, of not being <hi>led,</hi> or neglecting to be <hi>led</hi> by the Spirit; it is to be conſidered, that men and women may incur the guilt, and ſo the danger of not being led by the Spirit, two waies, or by two degrees:</p>
               <p>Firſt, When they are not inwardly attentive to the Spirit that doth ſpeak within them; I do not mean now, when they are not attentive to what the Spirit doth ſpeak within them: But when they are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to hear, or to hearken whether the Spirit will ſpeak, or hath any thing to ſpeak or ſay in ſecret unto them or no. As a man many times, and in many caſes, liſtens and hearkens, not only unto thoſe who he knows actually ſpeak, but to underſtand whether there be any ſpeech or voice ſtirring or no; eſpecially, they are wont to lie very cloſe in their attentions when they have reaſon to think that they, whoſe ſpeech or words they are deſirous to hear (in caſe they do ſpeak) will ſpeak but ſoftly, and with a low voice: In ſuch a caſe as this men are very careful to make no noiſe themſelves, nor to ſuffer any to be made about them, if they can help it; the reaſon hereof is plain, becauſe any noiſe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and drowns a ſoft voice that it cannot be underſtood: The Town Clerk of <hi>Epheſus</hi> could not be heard for a long ſeaſon becauſe of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar amongſt the People.</p>
               <p>Nor will a man of ordinary diſcretion, eſpecially being of a weak voice (though he hath never ſo great a deſire to ſpeak) attempt to ſpeak whileſt there is a noiſe round about him. This is the caſe in the great buſineſs before us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The voice of the Spirit of God in men, by which he guideth
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:95016:238"/>them, is but very ſoft and low [at leaſt ordinarily;] it is uttered by the Mouth of the Conſcience, which is not wont to be wide opened, unleſs it be in ſome broader or more known duties of the Second Table: what the reaſon hereof is, is not ſo proper for preſent conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Cares, Luſts, Thoughts, Deſires, Fears, and Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of things, relating to this preſent World, make a continual noiſe and hubbub in the hearts and inward parts of men and women generally: So that in caſe any thing were ſpoken to the heart, or inner man, eſpecially with a ſoft voice, whileſt theſe things are ſtirring in him, it will not be heard or minded. And therefore</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Holy Ghoſt, being a Spirit of Wiſdom, will not ſpeak (at leaſt ordinarily) unto hearts ſo full of diſtractions and confuſions.</p>
               <p>Neither fourthly, Do men, that voluntarily make noiſe, or ſuffer noiſes to be made about them, deſire to hear any man ſpeak unto them.</p>
               <p>Therefore fifthly (and laſtly) It follows from theſe Premiſes, that ſuch perſons who are earthly minded, and continually filled with the Cares, Luſts, or Deſires of this World, are either in no capacity at all to hear, or not at all care to hear any thing that the Spirit ſhall ſpeak unto them. Men that deſire to hear the Spirit of God ſpeaking in them, muſt ſequeſter and abſtract themſelves from the noiſe and tumults of this World: For the voice of the Spirit of God in men, that voice by which he ſuggeſts things in the Conſcience, is a ſtill and low voice; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when men are in a hurry in their thoughts, whileſt the World is lifting up its voice within them, there is no opportunity for him to ſpeak. When perſons are full of the Cares of this Life, and are making proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts thereof, there is no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for the Spirit to declare himſelf to them, or to ſhew them his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. <hi>I will hearken what the Lord will ſpeak,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.8. They that will liſten to this ſtill voice of the Spirit muſt muſe, muſt have all quiet within them, lay their ears cloſe unto what ſhall be ſpoken. They that do not thus hearken unto the Spirit of God, that do not thus liſten, and keep a perfect calm in their Spirits, are not likely to hear what the Spirit ſpeaketh in them.</p>
               <p>And yet in the fourth place there are another ſort of men and women worſe than theſe; and theſe are they that reſiſt the Spirit; <hi>Ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. where <hi>Stephen</hi> chargeth them with that grievous charge, that they reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt when he was ſtriving to do them good, and to acquaint them with the mind of God, with true holineſs, and waies leading to Salvation. They reſiſted him, <hi>i. e.</hi> fortified themſelves againſt him, caſt about with their Minds, and Reaſons, and Underſtandings how they might discover, and take hold
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:95016:239"/>of any pretenſe, why they ſhould not ſubmit unto ſuch and ſuch Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſuch Doctrines, ſuch Truths wherein the Holy Ghoſt did from time to time ſpeak unto them. By this means men are ſaid to reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt; and there is a Generation of men and women amongſt us who daſh their foot at this ſtone of death; who when the Spirit of God, either in the Word, or in the Counſel or Application of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Friends unto them, or otherwiſe preſenteth them with ſuch and ſuch truths of God which bear upon their Conſciences, making it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that it is for their good that they ſhould ſubmit themſelves in the courſe of their lives and waies unto them; and perſwading them to abandon ſuch and ſuch waies, to caſt from them all ſuch works which are contrary to thoſe truths and ſayings of God: They (I ſay) who are well aware of theſe motions and ſuggeſtions of the Spirit to them, and yet turn their backs upon them, are of this ſecond or worſer ſort, who becauſe they are deſperately unwilling to be led out of their old waies (loth to drink New Wine, ſaying the Old is better) therefore they withſtand the Spirit of God; even when he cometh with power, and is about to bind the Underſtandings of men that they might not be able to move. Now, he is not to be reſiſted, in ſuch caſes, but with a high hand of rebellion, and there muſt be abundance of enmity and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience againſt him; otherwiſe men would be led away in a bleſſed cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity unto Jeſus Chriſt. This is the reaſon why men, whom God hath had much to do with, who have lived under a mighty and powerful Miniſtry, either they are overcome, and prove the beſt and holieſt of men; or otherwiſe they muſt arm themſelves with ſuch weapons of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion which will prove them to be the moſt vile, and moſt deſperate ſinners in the World.</p>
               <p>A fifth (and laſt) ſort of Offenders are ſuch who neglect to ſow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Spirit; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> we uſe the Phraſe of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>He that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting.</hi> We have opened heretofore what it is to ſow to the Spirit: It is to do ſuch things, to go forth in ſuch waies, and to be found frequent in ſuch Actions and Practices which will turn to the praiſe, and honour, and glory of the Spirit of God; and not only ſo, but to do ſuch things with an eye and intention that the Spirit of God ſhould receive honour, and reap praiſe by ſuch their waies. Now he properly ſoweth unto a man, who doth intend that the man, to whom he ſoweth, ſhould reap benefit thereby: Even ſo a perſon is ſaid to ſow unto the Spirit of God, who frequently is engaged in ſuch waies and actions which he knows muſt of neceſſity turn unto the honour and praiſe of the Spirit of God. Now, if men and women ſhall riſe up in their obedience unto God above the line and common road of the World; if they ſhall walk in a more excellent way than their Neighbours, more excellent than the common ſort of Profeſſors about them: This muſt needs turn to the praiſe of the
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:95016:239"/>Spirit of God; for the means by which they are advanced, and gotten above their Neighbours, and become more excellent than they, this of courſe falleth, and is aſcribed by all to the honour and praiſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God: Men will conclude that ſurely the Spirit of God acteth and operateth in theſe men, and teacheth them more excellent works, and more heavenly curioſity than is found in the ordinary ſort of men in the World. Therefore they who refuſe thus to ſow unto the Spirit, when the Spirit firſt ſoweth unto them; that is, when the Spirit ſuggeſteth unto them, and graciouſly ſtirreth up, and tempteth their hearts and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to do ſuch Heroick Acts, wherein there is a more than ordinary ſtrain of goodneſs to be ſeen, they do not conſult the honour of the Spirit of God, nor their own peace and enriching, but on the contrary their own ſorrow and poverty.</p>
               <p>They (I ſay) that ſhall refuſe thus to ſow to the Spirit, when they ſhall find their hearts carried out from time to time, to do ſome excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing to go beyond the line of ordinary men; If any in this caſe ſhall ſay, there is no need of ſuch waies, that we ſhould ſtrain ſo high, or go ſo far to be Wiſer, or more Righteous, or fuller of Faith or good Works than other men are; and ſhall put off the Spirit of God with ſuch kind of Anſwers and Replies as theſe, and ſhall refuſe to ſow unto him, this muſt needs likewiſe tend to the grieving of the Spirit of God within them; and conſequently they are not like afterwards to find thoſe ſuggeſtions and impulſes in their hearts and conſciences as formerly they were wont to have. So much for this Uſe, being a Uſe of Reproof.</p>

               <p>THe Fourth (and laſt) Uſe is of Exhortation; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> if it be a Duty impoſed by God upon all Fleſh (eſpecially, upon thoſe who believe) to be filled with the Spirit, then let us all in the fear of God, and reverence of his Grace and Wiſdom, by which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth unto us things that are excellent, which make with an high hand both for our preſent and Eternal peace: Let us (I ſay) quit our ſelves like men, and hearken unto the voice of this Exhortation, and arm our ſelves with this Reſolution, that if there be any thing to be done by us, if there be any courſe or means, of which we are capable, whereby to be filled with the Spirit; that we will not come ſhort of this bleſſedneſs, that we will caſt in our Lots with thoſe which are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and filled with the Spirit, and will be filled alſo. Let us not (I beſeech you) be found amongſt thoſe who ſet at naught the Counſels of their God, and value his Words but as Wind; but let us rather conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how to provoke, every man of us, his own ſoul, and every man the ſoul of another, to ſet about the Duty now mentioned and enjoyned in the Text, and to lift up both heart and hand unto it. There are many Conſiderations, ſome of a more general, ſome of a more ſpecial
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:95016:240"/>and near relation to the Exhortation and Duty now commended unto you, that are full of ſpirit and life to quicken and ſtir you up to the performance of it.</p>
               <p>Firſt (in the general) you ſhall do well to conſider, that the Duty whereunto you have been exhorted, is one of that holy and righteous Retinue of Duties commanded unto us, and enjoyned upon us by God; and ſo the Exhortation by which it is enjoyned is one of the Counſels and Precepts of God, of the moſt High God; it is no foreiner or ſtranger amongſt them, it is none of the Tares which the Enemy hath introduced amongſt the Counſels of God. The complection of it ſhews it to be a Precept of that heavenly Parentage and Race, the goodneſs and lovelineſs of it ſheweth it to be from none other but God alone. It is too ſpiritual and holy, and too full of beauty to be of humane extraction, much leſs of a Diabolical: Therefore as Chriſt ſaid unto his Diſciples, in another caſe, <hi>I ſay unto you, my friends, fear not,</hi> &amp;c. Even ſo may God ſay unto you, <hi>I ſay unto you, my Friends, be filled with my Spirit.</hi> Though the reſidue of the World round about you will not ſtir, their hearts and conſciences will not budge at this Exhortation; they know not the worth of it: Yet you, oh my Friends, you that love me, you that are in a more peculiar manner beloved by me, be ye filled with my Spirit.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, this being one of the Royal Commands of God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> it therefore ſtands us in hand to look about us, and to bethink our ſelves, with the whole ſtrength and might of our Conſciences what we have to do in reference unto it. Sin, and Diſobedience unto God, or rather a neglect to obey the great Counſels of God is that which makes his Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie ſmoke againſt the World, from time to time, which makes the Foundations of the Earth to quake and tremble; which maketh havock and deſolation of the glory thereof. <hi>It is a fearful thing</hi> (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is our Remembrancer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31.) <hi>to fall into the hands of the living God, i. e.</hi> to come under his revenging hand (as is to be gathered from the former Verſe.) Now, What is it that cauſeth men to fall into the avenging hand of God but the deſpiſing his Counſels, and neglecting the Words of his Mouth without being reclaimed? Our ſimple not obeying the Commands of God is not ſo much as our neglecting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing his Commands: As on the other hand, our ſimple keeping or obeying them as our reverence and reſpects ſhewed unto them. A man, though he may receive many indignities from his Child, or others; yet if he do not apprehend that there is any neglect or contempt in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who offereth theſe indignities, he can bear it much the better: But if he apprehend that it proceeds from neglect and contempt, this is highly provoking. This is the caſe, my Brethren, for men and women to treſpaſs upon the Commandments of God at unawares, there being otherwiſe a reverential eſteem of theſe Commandments in the Soul, is
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:95016:241"/>not ſo provoking in the ſight of God; But it is the deſpiſing or neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commandments of God. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> coming by Commiſſion, immediately from God (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.9, 10.) did not charge the ſin, which <hi>David</hi> had committed, ſo much upon the Acts of Murther and Adultery, as upon his deſpiſing the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. <hi>Wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the Commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his ſight? David</hi> did not maintain that high and reverend eſteem in his heart and ſoul of theſe Commands of God which he had violated. So in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Therefore as the fire devoureth the Stubble, and the flame conſumeth the Chaff: So ſhall their Root be rotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Becauſe they have caſt away the Law of the Lord of Hoſts, and deſpiſed the Word of the Holy One of Iſrael.</hi> See alſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.60. And the Philoſopher, in his definition of anger, makes it the off-ſpring of neglect or contempt, implying, that it is never conceived, or kindled in any mans breaſt, by any other coal but that of contempt, at leaſt ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. My Brethren, God is a God of great patience; he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth much from the Sons and Daughters of men, and can paſs by a thouſand infirmities; He can bear with his Sons and Daughters under mighty Provocations: But if men ſhall go on, from day to day, in their neglect and contempt of him and his Counſels, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent when he giveth them ſpace, and admoniſheth them accordingly; if yet they will walk on in the ſtubbornneſs of their hearts, then he will make his Jealouſie to ſmoke againſt them: and it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. We heard but now what it is that cauſeth a man to fall into the hands of the Living God; and that not meerly the committing of ſin, but the deſpiſing of the Commands of God, the undervaluing of them, and caſting them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs; This is that which cauſeth the breach between men and that God whoſe name is Jealous. And therefore if the words of this Counſel and bleſſed Advice ſhall be flighted by us, and looked upon as a common word, and not be entertained as the Word of the Living God; this muſt needs provoke the Spirit of God, and cauſe the Great God of Heaven and Earth to break forth, as a Lion out of a Thicket, upon thoſe who have neglected and deſpiſed this Word of his. Indeed many men make but, as it were, <hi>a paſtime</hi> (as <hi>Solomon's</hi> Expreſſion is) <hi>Fools make a paſtime of ſin:</hi> So many make it but a matter of courſe to paſs by, and to give the Counſels of God a hearing; they enter in at one ear, and (there being none to entertain them, and keep them by the way) out they go at the other. But now, my Brethren, though the Counſels and Precepts of God make ſo little adoe in the World, make no noiſe there: Like unto Jeſus Chriſt, who in the daies of his fleſh made no clamour, nor lifted up his voice in the Streets; but when he ſhall come from heaven the Second time, then he will roar like a Lion, and turn the World upſide down, with ſuch a turn as it was never
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:95016:241"/>turned before: Even ſo will this Word, and this Counſel, and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and other the Commands of God; though now they do not cry, nor lift up their voice, make no noiſe in the World; but Silver, and Gold, and Pleaſures, and Honours, theſe are they that engage the World, and cauſe tumults in the minds and thoughts of men; theſe are they that ſet the World together by the ears, whileſt the Words and Counſels of God come not near the hearts of men, and have little to do there: Yet theſe Words are they that will judge the World at laſt, and find out the deſpiſers of them, and will place them at the left hand of Jeſus Chriſt, to whom it ſhall be ſaid. <hi>Depart from me ye curſed, I know you not.</hi> My Brethren, we know not how ſoon that day will come upon us; the Fig-trees and other Trees begin to put forth, and we cannot but think the Summer is near at hand: But ſuppoſe we ſhould deſpiſe this, and other the Precepts of God, and ſet them at naught, it may be we may ſee ſome daies of pleaſure, and eaſe, and contentment in the World; yet alas! <hi>What will it profit a man</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, who was the beſt Eſtimator concerning matters of profit) <hi>to gain the whole World and loſe his Soul?</hi> Much leſs will it profit a man to enjoy a few daies of eaſe and contentment, under the neglect and contempt of the Word of God, if at laſt he muſt loſe his Soul, or incur thereby Eternal Condemnation. Yea, if it ſhould be but the quenching the Spirit of our preſent joy, if it ſhould riſe no higher than ſo; this is ſuch a loſs, as that they who underſtand the true worth and value of it will think and conclude it to be a thouſand times better rather to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to reverence, and highly to eſteem all the Words, Counſels, and Exhortations of God, beginning at the firſt, and ſo carrying them on unto the laſt, and taking this along with them in their way, <hi>Be ye filled with the Spirit,</hi> than to loſe the preſent comfort of it by turning their backs upon this, or any other of the Commands of God. And therefore,</p>
               <p>Secondly, To ſtrengthen your heart, and your hand, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> that they may be lifted up together to the Exhortation, now commended unto you, you may further conſider, that it being one of the Precepts of God, and having now been made known in this relation unto you, your ſouls will never proſper, you will never be filled with that peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, you will never rejoyce that ſignal kind of joy which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> calleth unſpeakable and glorious, if you ſhall from henceforth neglect it, or caſt it behind your backs. For look, as a crack, or leake in a Veſſel, will not ſuffer it to fill with water, or other liquor (at leaſt) not remain full for any time, though much water be from time to time put into it: In like manner, though we ſhould be great doers in our own eyes, and though others may ſeem but as Graſhoppers in compariſon of us; yet nevertheleſs that peace, and that joy, and that inward comfort that you ſhould have if there
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:95016:242"/>were no neglect of any the Commands of God will ſuffer loſs. If this be the caſe, if any Command of God be deſpiſed or neglected; this will be as a dead Fly in your Box of Oyntment, and keep it from making that ſweet ſmell and ſavour, and from coming up into your Noſtrils; you will (in effect) loſe the preſent luſtre and beauty, if not the future reward, of all theſe choiſe ſervices, if you do otherwiſe. Now, I ſay, who would run the hazard of the loſs of the great benefits and bleſſings of ſuch great works through the neglect or non-performance of one? Who would loſe all the joy, peace, and comfore of many other ſervices, and of much obedience, otherwiſe exhibited unto God, and unto Jeſus Chriſt, only to pleaſe the fleſh, in the neglect of one Commandment? As it is with the natural health of the body; though a man ſhould uſe many means for his health and ſtrength, yet if he ſhould neglect one thing that is neceſſary for him to do; as ſuppoſe a man ſhould eat and drink ſuch things only as would keep the body in good habit, yet if he ſhould never ſleep; or if any other things as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as theſe be not uſed in their places and ſeaſons, health and good habit and ſtate of body will never be any mans portion: So in this caſe a man ſhall never find his ſoul in a comfortable habit, he ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be poſſeſſed with a ſpirit of joy, and of a ſound mind, but will be ever and anon apt to take hold of fears, and he will alwaies be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto temptations, unleſs he do run in his obedience round about the Commandments of God, ſo far as they are made known unto him. It is true, it is not a ſtep awry, now and then, beſides a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, no, nor an habitual, or continual omiſſion of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Duty or Precept, that will thus endamage the Soul; If men and women be truly conſciencious, and habitually careful to put in practice all they know of the good, and holy, and perfect will of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, their faces may ſhine, and their hearts be lifted up to Heaven: My meaning is, the reſt and peace of their ſouls may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and their inward man may be exalted highly; yea, though through the infirmities of the fleſh they ſhould ſometimes be prevented with ſome irregular and unworthy actions; ſuppoſing that what they ſcatter thorough the infirmities of the fleſh, they gather up again by the ſtrength of the Spirit, and repent <hi>toties quoties.</hi> As though a man let pieces of money drop out of his hand, yet if he preſently ſtoop and take them up again, he ſuffereth no great loſs: Even ſo, though a man, as often as he miſcarries, drops a proportion or quantity of his peace, yet if he ſtoop and gather up by Repentance that which he lets fall, his ſoul may ſtill proſper. But this is that which we ſay, that if a man ſhall ordinarily or conſtantly neglect any of the holy Counſels or Precepts of God, which have been diſcovered, and made known unto him for ſuch; ſuch a perſon will never thrive in his inner man, his Conſolations in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel will never be rich, or ſtrong; no, though he ſhould do many
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:95016:242"/>things otherwiſe very commendable and good, yea, and be zealous for God; that diſreſpect which he ſheweth to that one Commandment of God, whatever it be, will be like a Moth fretting his Garment; Or like a dead Fly in his Oyntment, that will drown the ſweet ſavour which otherwiſe it would breath forth. For though God can bear with the frailties and weakneſſes of men, and can endure them with much long ſuffering and patience under greater provocations than weakneſſes and infirmities; yet he will not, he cannot bear the coals of diſreſpects and neglects from men; neither will he countenance from Heaven man or woman under a contempt of his words, upon the account of any other ſervice or obedience whatſoever. We know the Charge was very ſtrict under the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Ye ſhall not add unto the Word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it, that you may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God,</hi> &amp;c. So Chap. 12.32. <hi>Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I command you obſerve to do it,</hi> &amp;c. You know, <hi>David</hi> that man of God, who had that large Teſtimony from Heaven, that he was a man after Gods own heart; yet he durſt not (it ſeemeth) promiſe himſelf any ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Judgments or diſpleaſure of God, upon any other terms but upon the condition of his conſciencious reſpects to all the Commandments of God, as well one as another, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. <hi>So ſhall I not be aſhamed when I have reſpect unto all thy Commandments.</hi> And our Saviour (<hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14.) maketh this the touchſtone of the Love and Friendſhip of his Diſciples unto him, <hi>viz.</hi> Zealouſly to do whatſoever they were commanded; <hi>Ye are my Friends if ye do whatſoever I command you.</hi> You may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the word Friend either Actively, or Paſſively, thus; you ſhall deſerve the name of Friends to God and Jeſus Chriſt (he ſpeaketh in the Evangelical Dialect) when you ſhall do (or to the utmoſt of your power endeavour to do) or when your hearts ſtand clearly and ſingly bent to do whatſoever I command you; though many times you may be interrupted in the way of your doing, yet ſhall not this hinder your acceptation with God, but you ſhall be dealt withal by him as if you had actually done the thing whatever it be. Or otherwiſe Paſſive, If you do whatſoever I command you, you ſhall be dealt withal as Friends, I will entreat you, as he that is the greateſt lover of his Friends doth; I will bountifully reward you, and gratifie you over and over; I will make the World to know and ſee that I indeed do love you. My Brethren, there is this reaſon why a neglect or diſreſpect of any of the Words or Precepts of God (being made known unto a man for ſuch) ſhould quench the ſpirit of the joy of all a mans ſervices or obedience beſides, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe he that deſpiſeth one, conſtructively deſpiſeth all; as <hi>James</hi> reaſoneth, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.10.11. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all;</hi> and thus he proves what he had ſaid, <hi>For he that ſaid, do not commit adultery, ſaid alſo, do not kill,</hi> &amp;c. As he that breaketh a Staff but in one part, yet is ſaid to
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:95016:243"/>break the whole Staff: Even ſo, this Law of God, though it conſiſteth in many Parcels, Branches, and Commands, yet is it one entire and perfect Rule of life, and of the waies of men. Now he that breaks this Rule in any one part, he is guilty of all, <hi>i. e.</hi> he is in effect guilty of all; or it is one and the ſame unto him as if he had broken and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed them all; for he ſpeaketh chiefly of matters of Puniſhment and Curſes in the Law. <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all things that are written in the Law to do them.</hi> If a man ſhould continue in nothing at all that the Law requireth, he ſhould but be accurſed; and if he did not continue in all, curſed is he too upon that account. I ſay then, if men do neglect, or paſs by, or ſlight any one of the Counſels of God, it is interpretatively the deſpiſing of them all. When men ſhall make Elect and Reprobates amongſt the Commandments of God, ſome they will keep with all their hearts, but others they will trample under their feet; this ſheweth, that the ground of that obedience which they do exhibit, and perform unto ſome, is not becauſe they are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, but ſomething elſe; For if it were out of a pure, true, and real reſpect to God, and reverence that they have unto him that is the Law-giver, they would reſpect one Law as well as another, and every Law as his fellow, and would make no difference between them. Now then, Let this be conſidered alſo which hath been propounded in the ſecond place to bind the Exhortation faſt and cloſs unto your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, it being one of the Precepts of God, and now made known unto you that you ought to be filled with the Spirit of God: If you ſhall caſt this behind your backs, or trample it under your feet, your keeping the reſt of the Commands of God, will turn but to a ſlender account unto you. Will you loſe all your other ſervices for God? Have you ſuffered ſo many things for God in vain? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.4. What, have you done ſo many things in vain as to your peace? Have you ſerved God in a firſt and ſecond Command, and will you loſe ſo great a recompenſe of reward, that fulneſs of peace, and height of rejoycing in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. <hi>Look to your ſelves that we loſe not thoſe things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</hi> You know, the young man that had kept ſo many of the Commands of God, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10.21, 22. that there was only one thing wanting; How ſad was it with him upon our Saviours diſcourſe? For it doth appear that his ſtate and condition Godward was very deplorable, notwithſtanding he had been ſo exact and obſervant of the Commands of God. So that if you deſire your hearts and ſouls ſhould be, like <hi>Jordan,</hi> overflowing their banks, if you deſire they ſhould be readily prepared to carry you up to Heaven in joy and gladneſs, then you muſt be careful to number this amongſt the Precepts of God; you muſt ſee to it that you endeavour to be filled with the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> The Exhortation now recommended unto you, is an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:95016:243"/>Exhortation, brought by Jeſus Chriſt from heaven, and in this reſpect ought to be more highly reverenced than if it had been delivered over unto you upon other terms. For this is to be conſidered, that what is delivered unto the World in the New Teſtament, by the mouth of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, or upon the account of his coming from Heaven unto the World (as all that which the Holy Ghoſt hath further revealed by the Apoſtles is) is more obliging and binding upon the Conſciences of men, and more ſeverely puniſhable by God, when neglected or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, than things delivered in the Old Teſtament, or before Chriſt's coming into the World were, or are. This (I conceive) is evident from that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.25. <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh: For if they eſcaped not who refuſed him that ſpake on earth, much more ſhall we not eſcape if we refuſe him that ſpeaketh from heaven.</hi> To open this paſſage a little, and ſo to give ſomewhat the more efficacy and weight to the Motive in hand.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It is to be conſidered, that the oppoſition here made, between him that ſpake on Earth, and him that now ſpeaketh from Heaven, doth not imply a plurality of Speakers, or perſons ſpeaking; but only a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the manner and terms of ſpeaking at ſeveral times, by one and the ſame Speaker, <hi>viz.</hi> God, or rather Chriſt; for it was he that ſpake both on earth by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that now ſpeaketh from Heaven. It is not unuſual, in Emphatical Diſcourſes, to ſpeak of one and the ſame perſon in different conſiderations as of two; as the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that came to make a ſuit to King <hi>Philip,</hi> He being drowſie, and giving her an unpleaſing anſwer, ſhe told him, She appealed from King <hi>Philip,</hi> when he was ſleepy, to King <hi>Philip</hi> when waking and more atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: Now, there were not two King <hi>Philips,</hi> but one, only as two in different conſiderations. We might bring ſeveral inſtances, wherein one and the ſame perſon is repreſented under two different conſiderations.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When God, or Chriſt, ſpake by <hi>Moſes,</hi> he is ſaid to have ſpoken on Earth, not becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was on Earth when Chriſt ſpake by him, but becauſe he ſpake by a man who was from the Earth, or earthly (as it is ſaid the firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> was) for otherwiſe the Lord Chriſt himſelf ſpake on the Earth [being on the Earth] as well as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo the oppoſition would fall: But <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who now ſpeaketh in the New Teſtament, is ſaid to be from Heaven [or, which is the ſame to ſpeak from heaven, though the word <hi>ſpeak</hi> is not in the Original, but inſerted by the Tranſlators as the different Character implieth:] but Chriſt (I ſay) is ſaid to be from Heaven, becauſe he was of a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, of an heavenly Parentage and propagation, being conceived by the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, in the Wombe of a Virgin, and not after the manner of men; according to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. <hi>The ſecond man is the Lord from Heaven;</hi> meaning, of an heavenly Parentage, or royal Deſcent (as hath been ſaid)
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:95016:244"/>wherein he had no Brother amongſt all the Children of men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It is to be conſidered, that whatſoever is diſpenſed unto the World, and conteined within the compaſs of the New Teſtament, as well in the Writings of the Apoſtles as of the Evangeliſts, is to be looked upon as the Diſpenſation of him who is from Heaven, as that which Chriſt himſelf ſpeaketh unto the World. And for this reaſon he is ſaid to be <hi>the Mediator of the New Teſtament,</hi> Heb. 9.15. And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>The Surety of a better Teſtament,</hi> Cha. 7.22. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in both theſe places (and elſewhere) tranſlated Teſtament, ſignifieth as well a Covenant, and is ſo tranſlated, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.25. and in many places beſides; and properly enough in the ordinary Grammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſenſe of it, it ſignifieth (in the general and indefinitely) any order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diſpoſing of things; ſo that when Chriſt is ſaid to be the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the New Teſtament, or of a New Covenant, the meaning is, that he is the Diſpenſer, or Promulgator, or Miniſter of God unto the World of a new ſpiritual Oeconomy of another ſpiritual Charter, Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, or Eſtabliſhment of matters relating unto the eternal peace and bleſſedneſs of the World, differing from that which God had formerly ſettled for a time by <hi>Moſes.</hi> This new Oeconomy Covenant or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things by the Lord Chriſt is called <hi>a better Covenant or Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, Becauſe it is ſettled upon <hi>better Promiſes,</hi> wherein God doth bring forth more of the bleſſed fruits of his Grace and rich Bounty unto the World; here life and immortality are brought to light; they are unvailed, and a glorious repreſentation made of them, that the World may look upon and ſee them face to face.</p>
               <p>Then ſecondly, It is called <hi>a better Covenant,</hi> becauſe here is a better diſcovery of the mind of God, concerning his Ordinances, which are of a more excellent and ſpiritual nature, and of higher acceptation with him: here are many things to be found which were not to be found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law. And Chriſt (in one of the places mentioned) is ſaid to be <hi>the Surety of this New Covenant, i. e.</hi> One that is the great Avou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or Aſſertor of it; One who undertakes with Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſecure the World of the truth and of the certainty of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and that it is from God. Now whatſoever is comprehended within the virge and limits of that part of the Scriptures, which is commenly called and known by the name of the New Teſtament, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to the New Covenant which Chriſt hath brought with him into the World, and hath publiſhed, ſettled, and eſtabliſhed here. In which reſpect he may truly and properly be ſaid to be the diſpoſer, and diſpenſer of the whole, and every part and parcel of it. And as he is ſaid to have ſpoken by the Prophets; ſo much more may he be ſaid now to have ſpoken by his Apoſtles; For whatſoever was ſpoken by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was upon the account of Chriſt, the Spirit by which they ſpake, was
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:95016:244"/>purchaſed by Jeſus Chriſt; ſo that the whole and entire Syſteme and body of Principles in the New Teſtament may all be aſcribed to Jeſus Chriſt, as if he ſpake all and every part thereof with his own mouth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) Evident is is from the oppoſition and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon which the Apoſtle here makes between him that ſpake on Earth (in the ſenſe mentioned) and him that ſpeaketh from Heaven; <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> and ſo from the greater obnoxiouſneſs unto Wrath and Puniſhment in him that ſhall neglect and diſobey the latter, above that which we found in him that diſobeyed the former; who notwithſtanding was ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by God. Evident (I ſay) it is from theſe Compariſons, that Evangelical Diſobedience, <hi>i. e.</hi> the known and cuſtomary neglect of any Precept in the Goſpel is of a far more provoking nature and import, and far more puniſhable than the Diſobedience of the former Law. Juſtice did not then require any ſuch ſevere execution upon Tranſgreſſors as now it doth. Upon this account God, reſpecting the times of the Goſpel, threatneth (<hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5.) that he would be <hi>a ſwift Witneſs;</hi> where it is evident that the Prophet ſpeaks of the daies of Chriſt. <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>ver.</hi> 2) <hi>may abide the day of his coming?</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>He ſhall ſit as a Refiner and Purifier of Silver, and he ſhall purifie the Sons of Levie.</hi> Ver. 4. <hi>Then ſhall the Offerings of Judah and Jeruſalem be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant unto the Lord.</hi> Implying, that Chriſt in the daies of the Goſpel will call men unto, and put them upon another manner of ſtrain of holineſs, and righteouſneſs, and heavenly mindedneſs than ever they had been put upon before. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will come near unto you in Judgment, and I will be a ſwift Witneſs againſt the Sorcerers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and fear ye not me ſaith the Lord of Hoſts?</hi> He would draw nigh unto them in Judgment then, whereas he was at a great diſtance from them in that reſpect under the Law. <hi>Forty years long</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was I grieved with this Generation:</hi> But God will not now be grieved long with any ſtubborn Generation of Delinquents under the Goſpel, though it may be he do not appear as a ſwift Judge in reſpect of Temporal Judgments; yet he will ſome way or other be a ſwift Witneſs againſt them, he will declare and make manifeſt from Heaven, after a competent time and reaſonable ſpace given them to repent, that he doth diſlike, and that he is highly diſpleaſed with their ſins, and wickedneſs, and diſobedience. It is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> tells the Jews (Chriſt being come into the World to ſettle a new Covenant better than the former) <hi>That the Axe was laid to the Root of the Tree,</hi> Mat. 3.10. meaning, that whereas before God laid the Axe to the Boughs of the Tree, but ſtill left the Root ſtanding, and ſo they did recover in time again from under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſevere Judgments: But Jeſus Chriſt being now come amongſt you, he being ſent unto the World, now look to your ſelves; if you do not every man turn from his Iniquity, every man from his Abomination, you will be cut down, and deſtroyed, and burnt with ſire. <hi>For his
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:95016:245"/>Fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floure,</hi> &amp;c. By what hath been ſaid we ſee, that to deſpiſe an Evangelical Precept or Command of God hath more of provocation of guilt and demerit in it, than former Tranſgreſſions and Provocations under the Law had. The Reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is plain, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe though ſome of the Evangelical Commands be more ſpiritual, and ſo more contrary unto, and more grating upon the fleſh, and in this reſpect more difficult to be obſerved than the Precepts under the Law were; yet notwithſtanding, all things conſidered, the rich and glorious advantages which the Goſpel affords unto men, above what the Law doth, to help them to obey: Theſe things conſidered, and laid in the Balance, it will appear, that a deſpiſing and neglecting of God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel, is a ſin of a far greater and deeper demerit than the neglect of a Command under the Law; for the more eaſie that obedience is, which is preſcribed, it is of ſo much the greater provocation and demerit when men ſhall neglect to obey. God having in the Goſpel afforded ſuch mighty Arguments and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the one hand to holineſs and vertue; and threatned deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with eternal fire on the other hand, to them that ſhall be diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. For men to be diſobedient under ſuch circumſtances as theſe is moſt provoking in the eyes of God. So that evident it is that ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have greater Motives, greater means to perſwade them to any ſervice, if they ſhall neglect and be deſpiſers of theſe Commands, their demerit is ſo much the greater, and their condemnation will be ſo much the ſorer upon them. But now, this Command, or Exhortation, to <hi>be filled with the Spirit,</hi> is not only Evangelical, but it hath a ſpecial and peculiar property in this kind, wherein it agreeth with few others; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the giving of the Spirit of God (<hi>viz.</hi> in ſuch a degree as to be filled with it) is appropriate to the New Teſtament. It is uſual in the Scriptures, when things are more fully done, and after a more rich and bountiful manner diſcovered, to repreſent them as newly done: though the Spirit of God was given under the Law; yet the proportion and quantity of it was but ſcanty in compariſon of what is now given under the Goſpel. Jeſus Chriſt is now glorified, and therefore he poureth out of his Spirit upon the Sons and Daughters of men more abundantly; So that to be <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> is a duty of ſuch a nature, that it is not only Evangelical, but likewiſe more purely Evangelical than many other duties are. This ſhould be a great Argument, which ſhould bear upon our Spirits to perſwade us to ſubmit our ſelves unto the obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to gird up the loins of our minds, and to go about this great duty with all readineſs.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Four Conſiderations more to enforce the Exhortation. The fourth Motive: the great benefit accruing unto men and women by a ſerious engagement in a courſe likely to iſſue in a being filled with the Spirit. It will free men and women from fooliſh, unclean, and noyſome luſts, ſomewhat peculiar in this engagement differing from others, though worthy in their kind. A fifth Motive, proving that in caſe men do what God hath and doth enable them to do in order to a being filled with the Spirit of God, this their enterprize ſhall aſſuredly proſper in their hand. Hope of obtaining great encouragement unto Endeavours. Some more of the great Priviledges that accompany a being filled with the Spirit. A ſixth Motive, That the Reaſons and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of men are not capable of being employed upon terms of greater benefit and advantage than in this engagement. A ſeventh Conſideration, taken from the uncertainty of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things of this World by all the means that can be uſed, and alſo from the uncertainty of the continuance of theſe things, if gotten: Whereas a being filled with the Spirit, as it is attainable, ſo by a perſeverance in the uſe of means our attainments in this kind ſhall ſtand by us for ever.</head>
               <p>FOurthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> to perſwade you to be filled with the Spirit of God I ſhall further recommend, by way of Motive, unto you, That the very exerciſe of your minds, hearts, and ſouls about the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, your very labours, and endeavours to obtain ſuch a prize as a being filled with the Spirit is, will turn to an happy account, and be of worthy concernment unto you; not only at the winding up of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, not only at the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and receiving the Crown (of which more in another Motive:) but even the running of the Race it ſelf will bleſs you (and that to a very good degree.) He that ſhall ſeriouſly engage himſelf in a courſe likely to produce and iſſue, in a being filled with the Spirit, will in a great meaſure be free from ſuch fooliſh, vain, and noyſome thoughts and luſts, from ſuch impertinent and ſinful excurſions, and runnings to and fro of his mind, where into men and women, that are diſengaged in this kind, are continually
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:95016:246"/>obnoxious, and hereby treaſure up nothing but ſorrow and ſhame to themſelves. It was a prophane Speech, and full of ſlander, which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> uſed to the Officers of the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they came to him to complain of their Burthens and Oppreſſions by their Taskma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Ye are idle, ye are idle</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>therefore ye ſay, let us go and do ſacrifice unto the Lord.</hi> But it may be ſaid with ſoberneſs and truth, that men and women, becauſe their hearts are idle and looſe from all ſpiritual Engagements and Projections; Therefore they ſay, Come let us follow vain pleaſures; Let us provide thus and thus for the fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh; and otherwhile ſwarms and multitudes of Cogitations that have neither head nor foot (as we uſe to ſay) that are profitable for nothing, that have little or no tendency at all to one end or other, are rambling up and down in the inward parts of men. One main reaſon of that ſad poſture wherein God beheld the World when he intended to deſtroy it by the Floud, when <hi>every imagination of the thoughts of men were evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5. [or every day:] One main Reaſon (I ſay) why the World was now overgrown with ſinful and vain imaginations and thoughts, was, becauſe men and women (the Inhabitants hereof) were under no great ſpiritual Engagements. This would have compoſed them, and drawn off thoſe Imaginations of their hearts, which were now evil continually, from thoſe objects and occaſions which made them evil, and carried them to objects and occaſions of an happy conſequence and import. The ſame thoughts and moral actings of their Souls, or puttings forth of their imaginative Faculties, had they been but directed unto, and ſet upon ſuch objects and occaſions which were honourable and good; this would have altered their properties, and changed their natures from evil unto good: For look what a good and faithful Shepherd is to his Sheep, he keeps them from ſcattering, from wandring and going aſtray into places of danger, and where they may be loſt, and cauſeth them to feed in ſafety: Look (I ſay) what a good Shepherd is to his Sheep, ſuch is a ſteady and fixed deſign being honourable, and worthy to the thoughts and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of the hearts of men; it keeps them from ſcattering and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wild this way or that, where they are like to be loſt and vaniſh into nothing; it keeps them from applying or bending themſelves to occaſions and things that are evil, and cauſeth them to hunt cloſe, and to follow the ſweet and rich ſent of ſuch a Game, which when it is taken and won will enrich and bleſs men abundantly. Now any ſpiritual deſign for God and Jeſus Chriſt, carried on with ſtrength and vigour, this is that which will repell all your vain and fooliſh thoughts, it will draw away all that food which fed and nouriſhed them; it will make havock and deſolation amongſt all your vain thoughts, and ſinful Luſts which are ſtriving within you, in order to the gratifying of the Fleſh. And this is to be conſidered further, that the greater and more comprehenſive a
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:95016:246"/>man's Engagement or deſign is, the Dominion which it hath over his thoughts is ſo much the larger; it beareth ſway over ſo many the more of a man's thoughts, and leaves a liberty of extravagancy unto ſo many the fewer of them; yea, Umpires with ſo much the higher and ſtricter hand of authority amongſt thoſe unto which its dominion extendeth.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, Suppoſe a man's deſign be to live juſtly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> or righteouſly in the World, or to live ſoberly; theſe deſigns are good, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but they are but narrow in compariſon of ſome others; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of that of <hi>being filled with the Spirit.</hi> A man that is ſeriouſly and ſolemnly engaged in his heart and ſoul to live juſtly, to wrong, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or defraud no man; by vertue of this his deſign he muſt needs refrain all thoughts of injuſtice, all projections, or deviſings which tend to the injuring or endamaging any man in his Eſtate (at leaſt ſo far as he apprehends any tendency in thoughts this way) and conſequently all thoughts and imaginations that may ariſe within him towards Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs or expenſive living, and all thoughts of Idleneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So on the other hand, he muſt needs raiſe and ſtir up ſuch thoughts and reſolutions within him, and exerciſe himſelf in them which are proper to diſpoſe and ſtrengthen him to deal juſtly by all, and to give every man that which is his due. For whoſoever doth not reſiſt and reject all thoughts of the former tendency, and indulge and nouriſh all of the latter, it is a plain caſe that he is not full of that heavenly engagement or deſign we ſpeak of; I mean, of dealing juſtly by all men, he is hollow and ſlight in it. But a man may be really under the command of this deſign, and yet be extravagant and impertinent in thoughts of another nature and tendency, I mean, vain and ſinful in thoughts of ſeveral other kinds which we ſhall not particularly inſiſt upon. There are many vain thoughts which may be entertained in the minds and hearts of men, which carry no direct oppoſition to the deſign of giving to every man his due. Now, becauſe this deſign is but narrow, although it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth it ſelf to many of a man's thoughts; yet nevertheleſs, there are many others that are as bad as theſe, that may have a ſtanding in the hearts of men, and have place and room to abide there. There is the ſame Reaſon and Conſideration of all other Purpoſes, Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Deſigns that are of ſuch a particular and limited nature as this.</p>
               <p>But that deſign or engagement, which in the preſent Motive we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend unto you, <hi>viz.</hi> to be <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> is more comprehenſive, and where it hath taken the heart or ſoul with ſtrength and power, it extendeth its Juriſdiction and Command to all a man's Thoughts, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, Counſels, mental Agitations, Ends, and Aims whatſoever; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating, Reſtraining, Ordering, Umpiring, ſetting up, and caſting down, according to the exigency and import of it. This is the very
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:95016:247"/>nature of this deſign, that he that hath eſpouſed it hath, upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, threatned all vain Thoughts, all looſe Cogitations; he hath threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them all with ruine and deſtruction, and with the caſting them out of his heart for ever.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon hereof is, becauſe the nature of this Engagement is ſuch, that it cannot be effectually promoted or carried on but by a diligent and vigilant ſuperintendency and inſpection over all a man's thoughts, and all that ſtirreth or moveth, or that is conceived in him. For the Spirit taketh check, and is grieved (at leaſt to a degree) at every connivance or indulgence of any thing that is impertinent, unſavoury, and fooliſh, inordinate, or irregular in the heart or inward part of a man, and muſt have nothing cheriſhed, favoured, or ſo much as tolerated here, but what is ſober, holy, juſt, and every waies conformable to the Law and Mind of God; otherwiſe he will not advance or lift up himſelf in the mind and ſoul of a man, upon any ſuch terms as he is ready to do when he is pleaſed and accommodated to his mind in all things. It is true, it is not the meer conceiving or riſing up of fooliſh, vain, and irregular thoughts in the heart or mind of a man or woman, which is diſtaſteful to the Holy Ghoſt, ſo as to offend or grieve him; for then he ſhould take pleaſure in no man whatſoever; but it is the indulging of them, and when nothing is done to ſuppreſs them: it is not ſimply their riſing up in the minds of men, but the approving of them, or at leaſt the not endeavouring to ſuppreſs them, which cauſeth the Spirit of God that he will not, cannot work mightily, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29, 30. Where the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts the <hi>Epheſians that no corrupt communication ſhould proceed out of their mouths;</hi> He adds, <hi>And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, by which ye are ſealed unto the day of Redemption.</hi> Corrupt Communication doth argue, that the root of bitterneſs within a man is let alone and winked at; for otherwiſe, if it had been taken while it was a luſt, while only in the bud, it would never have proceeded ſo high; let therefore no corrupt Communication proceed out of your mouths, and grieve not the holy Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When fooliſh diſpoſitions are let alone, they will grow as weeds, which if plucked up whileſt young would keep from ſeeding: So if Luſt and ſinful motions be rejected at firſt coming, they will never ſhew themſelves out of doors. Therefore when any perſon, man or woman, ſhall have eſpouſed that moſt honourable and heavenly deſign we ſpeak of, of <hi>being filled with the Spirit;</hi> if they be loyal and true to their Eſpouſals in this kind, they muſt, and cannot but abſtain from, and ſuppreſs all abſurd, fooliſh, and extravagant thoughts. On the contrary, It is very conſiderable, that theſe importune and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Gueſts, or Inmates we ſpeak of, vain, wilde, fooliſh, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent motions and thoughts will hardly ever be reduced or brought to leave the mind or ſoul of a man, unleſs it be by the interpoſure of ſome-great and worthy deſign cordially entertained and reſolved on by
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:95016:247"/>the Soul; there is hardly any other courſe will do it: And when any man or woman ſhall for ſome tolerable time have practiſed this ſuppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and rejection of vain and fooliſh thoughts, as they ariſe and put forth in them, they ſhall for the future have leſs and leſs trouble with them, they will not be ſo apt to riſe in that heart or ſoul which is not wont to give them entertainment, where they are like to die as ſoon as they begin to live: Even as weeds by oft removing and cutting their roots are quite killed in time, their root is diſcouraged and dieth; or as hurtful flocks of Birds, by being oft frighted or driven away from the Corn, grow weary of coming there, where they are continually frighted, and not ſuffered to have any reſt or peace.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee the truth of the Motive in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> That the very exerciſe of the heart, mind, and ſoul, about the buſineſs or engagement of being filled with the Spirit is of a rich and excellent concernment un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, not only in reference to the grand prize or end of being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> but alſo in reſpect of other ſervices it will do you by the way. It will (as you have heard) put you upon another bleſſed exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, I mean, to keep your hearts and minds free from a troubleſome and ignoble Rabble of fooliſh, vain, unprofitable, and noyſome thoughts. Let us (only for a cloſe of this Motive) weigh and ponder a little, of how happy and worthy a conſequence and concernment it is for men and women to have eaſe and freedom in this kind, to be delivered from ſuch cogitations and thoughts which are apt without end to infeſt and moleſt their minds and hearts (which ought to be a Temple for the Holy Ghoſt to dwell in:) being good for nothing but to diſhonour, pollute, and defile wherever they come, and to put by their betters. My Brethren, to make you ſee of what great concernment it is to you, you may pleaſe to conſider, that your minds and underſtandings are the moſt noble and divine part of our nature, and the puttings forth of them, are the beſt Trees in our Orchard, and thoſe that will bear the beſt and largeſt fruit. Now then, for theſe to give out their ſtrength in things that be unprofitable, and not only ſo, but in that which annoyeth, moleſteth, and defileth a man, is ſo great an imbaſement of them, and will turn to ſo great damage and loſs, that it cannot in reaſon but be apprehended a mighty accommodation to be free from the cauſe hereof. Now then, inaſmuch as we are not born free, nor can be free in this kind but by much labour, My Brethren, If any of you (as it is ſaid of <hi>Lot,</hi> that he vexed his righteous ſoul with the unclean Converſation of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7.) have vexed your ſouls with theſe impure thoughts, and malignant cogitations; if you have been truly ſenſible, and have taken knowledge of them, it is impoſſible but that you ſhould much lament the loſs and damage your minds and underſtandings do you, when they bring forth ſuch rotten fruit; whereas if they were taken off from ſuch corruptions as theſe, they would conceive other manner of
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:95016:248"/>births, births that are ſpiritual, that would make you glad when they are born. It cannot but be, to any conſidering Chriſtian, matter of offence and grievance to find himſelf continually annoyed, and that he ſhould have troubleſome Gueſts from day to day, and there ſhould be no end, no remedy againſt it. I beſeech you conſider, How can men lay out themſelves, upon more deſirable terms, than to benefit themſelves, than to make themſelves truly happy in this World, and likewiſe in the World to come? Now, the greateſt things muſt, in reaſon, be conceived to proceed from that which is moſt noble, the Spring and Fountain of all commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable things: Now, this Fountain is the Mind, Underſtanding, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a man; theſe muſt do it, otherwiſe men will never do any thing either for themſelves, or others, to any purpoſe: Therefore it is a thing worthy of us to hearken and learn how we may keep our hearts from running out their ſtrength upon ſuch things which defile us, that they may attend only upon ſuch which are ſweet and rich, ſuch as are pleaſant both unto God, and unto Angels, and unto men; and ſhall be moſt pleaſant unto our ſelves and our own ſouls, when our taſte is but come to us, when we ſhall be able judiciouſly to taſte, and diſcern the true worth and value of ſpiritual things.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> To promote the word of Exhortation propounded in your hearts and ſouls, you may pleaſe further to conſider, that if you will do that for the gaining of this Treaſure of being <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> which God hath enabled you, or ſhall enable you further to do in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, the enterprize ſhall moſt certainly proſper in your hands, and you ſhall be filled with the Spirit of God; your Seed ſhall not rot under the Clod, but ſhall yield an harveſt. God doth not put men to run for Prizes which are not to be obtained by running, <hi>So run</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that you may obtain,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24. Doubtleſs, if it be true of God in the courſe of nature, that he giveth to every Seed its own Body: It is much more true in ſpiritual caſes, and in the Affairs of Heaven; he will reward every mans labour, every mans endeavour. Whatſoever a man ſoweth in this kind he ſhall reap; and if he ſhall ſow plentifully, <hi>i.e.</hi> if he ſhall ſhew ſo much care and diligence, as is requiſite to bring about this great bleſſing, he ſhall eat of the labour of his hands, yea, happy ſhall he be. Indeed ſometimes God ſuffers the natural Seed which is ſown in the Earth to miſcarry, and never to yield any fruit or encreaſe, according to that of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 12.13. <hi>Ye ſhall ſow Wheat, and reap thorns, Deut.</hi> 28.38. And that alſo in <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.20. <hi>And your ſtrength ſhall be ſpent in vain, and your Land ſhall not yield her encreaſe.</hi> Thus ſometimes it cometh to paſs: but you ſee, God threatneth it as a matter out of courſe, which would never come to paſs were it not that God did this for the puniſhment of them that are wicked, and have mach provoked him. He ſometimes withdraweth himſelf from nature and ſecond cauſes: But for the Promiſes of God, in the courſe of ſpiritual waies and means,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:95016:248"/>there is never any exception here; for if a man ſow wickedneſs, If he <hi>ſow to the fleſh, he ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption,</hi> Gal. 6.7, 8. On the other hand, whatſoever good thing a man doth, the ſame ſhall he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>viz.</hi> in the reward of it. God hath put himſelf in ſtrict Bonds and Obligations, that if men ſhall do that which he hath given them in charge to do, if men ſhall ſtudy and uſe the means of Grace with that diligence, care, faithfulneſs, and goodneſs of Conſcience which he hath preſcribed and enjoyned them; look whatſoever this means is proper to produce, this they ſhall be ſure to enjoy. God is not wont to provoke men to ſuch things which are not attainable; he doth not deal ſo with his Creature, he only promiſeth ſuch things which are very fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and attainable by thoſe Methods and means which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them to uſe, by doing thoſe things which they may very well do, quitting themſelves but like men. It is true indeed, though the prize of being filled with the Spirit be never ſo rich, though it will cauſe a mans face to ſhine like the face of an Angel, or like God himſelf; yet if it lie not within any mans reach, if a man might lay out himſelf after the moſt effectual manner, and yet notwithſtanding come ſhort in the end; this would ſtifle all inclinations and diſpoſitions this way: yea, and to ſtir up men and women by any other Motive, though never ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, would be to very little purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Let this be another Motive to ſtir you up to fall-in with the Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion propoſed unto you; you ſhall not loſe your labour, you ſhall not ſow your Seed in vain, but ſhall have a goodly and bleſſed recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of reward for whatſoever you ſhall do faithfully and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly herein: you may be aſſured, that though to be filled with the Spirit be an exceeding great and high priviledge, and hath much of God, and of glory in it, yet are you in a capacity to come at it, and enjoy it.</p>
               <p>My Brethren, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> we ſpeak great things unto you of this being <hi>filled with the Spirit:</hi> But it may be you will ſay, Wherein doth the greatneſs of it lie? What great or excellent things are there in it, that we ſhould be willing to conſent unto you to lay out our ſelves for the obtaining it? And it ſeems we muſt do it throughly, and not be remiſs, or half-hearted in the work, but muſt quit our ſelves like men, with the beſt of our might and ſtrength; and therefore What is this great thing which you call <hi>A being filled with the Spirit?</hi> Or upon what account ſhall we be more happy and bleſſed in our Conditions, when we have compaſſed it, than whileſt we are without it?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, That though men had the Tongues of Angels, and the Underſtandings and Wiſdom of Angels too, yet they could not declare fully the glory, nor the bleſſedneſs of ſuch a ſtate; the heights, depths, and the lengths and breadths of this high Priviledge or Prerogative of being filled with the Spirit. If the thing could fall within the virge
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:95016:249"/>of humane Underſtanding, and could be uttered, if you could rightly conceive of the worth or excellency of it, this would make you call it the Priviledge of a man, or ſomething that a man can reach or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he would expreſs the tranſcendency of that Priviledge which he calls <hi>the peace of God,</hi> Phil. 4.7. he deſcribes it to be ſuch a thing <hi>which paſſeth all underſtanding.</hi> This Character of it gives it high honour, and double eſteem in the hearts and minds of men; but if he ſhould have expreſſed it in any ſuch terms which had ſet limits and bounds unto it, and told them that it was good to ſuch and ſuch a degree, but not further, this had been apt to have diminiſhed the eſteem and reputation of it, and conſequently to have interrupted and checked the deſires of it in the hearts of men: Even ſo we may ſay concerning this great Priviledge of <hi>being filled with the Spirit;</hi> if we could meaſure out unto you, and were able to ſay, that it is thus much and no more, this were neither for your benefit, or profit, neither ſhould we be found faithful or true Witneſſes of thoſe excellent and glorious things of God. There is no queſtion but that the Apoſtles in their daies did make large diſcoveries of the peace of God, and ſpake many glorious things of it, ſo much that might have enflamed the hearts of men to have deſired it; but yet there was more than all this in that Character whereby it is deſcribed, <hi>viz. A peace that paſſeth all underſtanding:</hi> So queſtionleſs many great and excellent things (and that according to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and truth) may be ſpoken concerning this great and happy Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; yet if we ſhould attempt any thing in this kind, without giving knowledge, that we do not ſpeak limitedly, or to confine your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, as if there were nothing further or greater in it, beſides, and above, or beyond what we can expreſs without ſome ſuch intimation or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> but ſcanty, narrow, and low: God doth not care that much of his Work ſhould paſs thorough their hands, becauſe they will not quit themſelves ſo as to anſwer the Majeſty of God, nor the excellency of ſuch Services: Whereas thoſe that are <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> look what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they go about, or put forth their hearts unto, they will carry it on with the greateſt authority and higheſt hand; neither will they baulk this or that Truth of God, nor in the leaſt give in for any oppoſition or contradiction of Men. Now this is a great Priviledge (if we had hearts to conceive aright of it:) for a man or woman to be much
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:95016:249"/>imployed, or much ſet on work by God; the Angels are (as it were) proud of his ſervice: Chriſt, ſpeaking of his little ones, ſaith. <hi>Their Angels do alwaies behold the face of my Father which is in heaven, Mat.</hi> 18.10. They ſtand waiting to ſee if there be any ſervice or imployment; they ſtrive who ſhall be moſt ſet on work, and who ſhall have moſt put into their hands, for this is their honour and their glory. And doubtleſs, my Brethren, if we had but the true ſenſe and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the tranſcendent worth, and deſirableneſs of ſerving God, and of being imployed by him in the world, we ſhould account of it, and eſteem it after another manner of rate than I fear generally we do. Another thing was this; they that are partakers of that bleſſedneſs are upon the matter out of the reach of all ſorrows or troubles about any thing that can befall them in this preſent World; thoſe things which cut other men to the very heart and ſoul, theſe men are ſecured from; when the World riſeth up and lieth down by them they know not; they are in an heavenly extaſie, or a ſpiritual kind of drunkenneſs: As <hi>Lot,</hi> being drunk, knew not when his Daughters roſe up from him, nor lay down by him: men that are full of the Spirit are lifted up, they are in the upper Region, where no ſtorms, no tempeſts, nor troubleſome things come, there is a perpetual ſerenity, clearneſs, and peaceableneſs of mind; whileſt the World generally, and thoſe that are ſtrangers to this fulneſs of the Spirit, are toſſed to and fro, tumbling up and down, their thoughts diſquieting and tormenting them continually. And ſo again we ſhewed, that they that are filled with the Spirit are to a degree freed from Temptations. It is ſaid of God, <hi>He cannot be tempted with evil, Jam.</hi> 1.13. Now ſuch men are partakers of that bleſſedneſs of God himſelf, as far as fleſh and bloud is capable of drawing near unto him, <hi>Reſiſt the Devil and he will flee from you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>James, c.</hi> 4.7.) Brethren, Why ſhould the Devil flee from him that reſiſteth him, and giveth him a peremptory denial? It is becauſe that he hath much to do, and but little time to do it in, and he will not loſe his time when he hath no hope to ſpeed; he is then as if he ſtood upon thorns, (as we uſe to ſay;) if he get no profit or advantage by his Suggeſtions, it is ſo much out of the way of his miſerable comfort, and that ſolace which he is capable of during his preſent ſtate and condition; all his ſolace being this, to draw men into communion and fellowſhip with himſelf in his miſery: and knowing by his own experience that the way thereunto lieth by the way of ſin and doing wickedly; therefore he laboureth to entice men to walk in ſuch waies, knowing if he can but draw men into theſe paths he will preſently meet with them, and that they will arrive at that place of endleſs miſery and torment which he is gone unto. But now this great and bleſſed Priviledge of <hi>being filled with the Spirit of God</hi> will make all the enticements and allurements, all the baits and temptations to evil of no force; they will be as Arrows
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:95016:250"/>ſhot againſt a brazen Wall, that will recoyl and turn upon him that ſhooteth them; So that we need not ask a queſtion, What the fulneſs of the Spirit meaneth? You ſee it is worthy all your labours, all your endeavours and layings out of your ſelves in one kind or other; though you ſhould prejudice your fleſh never ſo much upon the account of it, yet nevertheleſs there is no cauſe for you to complain; for the Priviledge is ſo great, that it will do a thouſand times more than bear its own charge, and it will recompenſe a thouſand fold into your boſome, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you expend of your pleaſures and enjoyments in the World for the attaining of it.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> To promote the intereſt of the Exhortation propounded in your hearts and ſouls, and to make you deſirous indeed to be filled with the Spirit of God, you may pleaſe yet further to conſider, that your Minds, Reaſons, and Underſtandings, with whatſoever beſides ſhall be neceſſary for you to imploy or lay out, about this great and bleſſed undertaking, cannot be diſpoſed of or imployed by you upon the like terms of benefit, comfort, and advantage unto you in every kind in any other way. Suppoſe you ſhall totally lay aſide, and cut off from your minds and thoughts that engagement we ſpeak of (as the far greateſt part of the World ſeem to do) and pitch upon ſome other end and projection beſides to beſtow your time and opportunities upon, and to exerciſe and imploy your Reaſons and Underſtandings about, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you ſhall pitch upon in this kind you will make a loſing bargain by the hand, you will but ſow the wind (in compariſon.) Put caſe you ſhould wave and decline the great buſineſs of being filled with the Spirit, and ſhould lay out your money, give the Price that is in your hand to purchaſe Honour, or ſome great place of Preferment in the World: One thing is, you may be defeated and diſappointed in what you lift up your heart unto in this kind; many have ſtrained themſelves, and crackt the beſt vain in their hearts to catch at this ſhadow, and yet have miſſed it: As <hi>Abſolom</hi> laboured in the very fire to make himſelf King, but his device was too great for him to perform; whileſt he put forth his hand to reach a Crown, he took hold of nothing but death and ruine.</p>
               <p>Again ſecondly, Suppoſe a man ſhould be able to make his neſt amongſt the Stars, <hi>and to walk up and down in the midſt of Stoves of fire</hi> (as it is ſaid of the King of <hi>Tyre, Ezek.</hi> 28.14.) in reſpect of gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur in the World; yet even this would be but a faint and heartleſs condition in compariſon. A Neſt amongſt the Stars is in continual dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being pulled down (as all that have been made there ſince the beginning of the World have been) and he that walketh up and down with the greateſt confidence and ſecurity amongſt the Stoves of fire (as the King of <hi>Tyre</hi> did) will be ſooner at the end of his walk than he is aware of: Whereas he that is <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> the very taſte and reliſh of
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:95016:250"/>his condition is rich above meaſure, heart-taking and ſoul-pleaſing: He knows that, unleſs he himſelf ſhall pull down voluntarily, and with both his hands, what he hath built up for himſelf in peace and happineſs, his Mountain is too ſtrong ever to be removed either by Angels or men. There is the ſame conſideration of all other ends or deſigns whatſoever, which may be conceived to be Competitors with the great work we have ſo much ſpoken of, and with ſo much affection and importunity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended unto you.</p>
               <p>If you ſhall cauſe your minds and underſtandings to ſerve you in raiſing your ſelves to great Eſtates in the World, and gathering in Riches, and making your Families great on Earth, or in making proviſion of pleaſures and delights for the fleſh in one kind or other; any of theſe will be but like the pilling of ſtraws (as we uſe to ſay) in compariſon; they will be loſs unto you. Thoſe Noble and Princelike Faculties of Reaſon, Judgment, and Underſtanding were created and formed by God, and veſted in the Natures or Souls of men, with a regular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and as it were on purpoſe to make after deſigns truly honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and high, ſuch as a being filled with the Spirit of God is, together with others of like nature and worth with it; and not at all to project or make proviſion for the fleſh, or for the outward man, ſave only in due ſubordination unto theſe. As on the other hand, theſe ſpiritual and heavenly deſigns, theſe high enjoyments are in their Natures and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions ſuited to the ſaid Faculties, and as it were made and deviſed by God to be ſought after, compaſſed, and obtained by them: Much after the ſame manner, as the Apoſtle obſerveth the reciprocal proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Nature, and the Providence of God between the belly and meats; <hi>Meats</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for the belly, and the belly for meats;</hi> meaning, the belly with the Appurtenances of it in the natural body of a man (and ſo of other Creatures) is ſo ordered and tempered by the natural conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that it is apt to receive and concoct meat, and convert it to the nouriſhment, ſtrength, and health of the body: As on the other hand, meats are of ſuch a nature and conſtitution as that they are ſutable to the belly, and apt to be digeſted there, and turned into nouriſhment; and therefore as it would be an unnatural kind of handling the mouth, ſtomach, and belly, an abuſe of them contrary to Nature to put ſtones and dirt into them, or any thing that is contrary to the nouriſhment and good habit and ſtate of the body or outward man: In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for men and women to compel their Minds, Reaſons, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to labour and travel, either only, or principally about things of an inferiour worth, and periſhable nature, is a kind of unnatural dealing with them, when as they are naturally endowed, and made capable of higher engagements and attainments: It is to reproach their excellency, and to change their natural uſe into that which is againſt nature.</p>
               <pb n="474" facs="tcp:95016:251"/>
               <p>The Scripture it ſelf from place to place urgeth and preſſeth upon men the Notion and Import of the Motive in hand, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> holding it forth with great emphaticalneſs and weight of Words and Phraſes, how great a matter of diſparagement and ſhame, and other while, what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable loſs is it unto men to make thoſe Princes, we ſpeak of, to go on foot; I mean, thoſe divine Endowments of their Souls to travel for the wind of the ſlight Accommodations of this preſent World, being capable of ſuch imployments by the Law of their Creation; by which the face of the Creature Man may ſhine for evermore. Conſider we briefly ſome few paſſages in this kind inſtead of many, <hi>Labor not to be rich: ceaſe from thine own wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.4, 5. <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a Fool to get Wiſdom, ſeeing he hath not a heart to it? Pro.</hi> 17.16. He ſpeaketh here as if Wiſdom were in a great paſſion to ſee men enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God for great attainments, and yet it ſhould ſo fall out that they imployed theſe abilities and faculties about things that were but meer Toyes. By Wiſdom he means ſuch things whereby he ſhall proclaim himſelf to be wiſe, if he ſhall ſeek after them, namely, all the bleſſed conequences of Wiſdom, as Happineſs, Bleſſedneſs, Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the general, and every particular contained in theſe generals which any way may ſerve to advance the Creature man in true joy, or felicity. Now Wiſdom (as was noted before) ſpeaks with great indignation interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative wiſe: <hi>Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a Fool,</hi> &amp;c. a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantage to make his face to ſhine, and yet he not have a heart to improve it, but turns the means which God hath put into his hand quite another way?</p>
               <p>Let us alſo conſider that other place, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Wilt thou ſet thine eyes upon that which is not? For Riches certainly make themſelves wings, they fly away,</hi> &amp;c. There is an Emphaſis in this Expreſſion <hi>[that which is not;]</hi> we know the Spirit of God is no reproacher of his Creature; and as for Silver, and Gold, Houſes, and Lands, theſe are all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, therefore he will not vilifie them beneath their worth, or pour any ſuch ſhame and contempt upon them which ſhall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them more vain than they are. Far be it from us to think, that God, who is the Maker of them, ſhould ſpeak of them after ſuch a manner.</p>
               <p>But why doth Wiſdom give ſuch a name of diſparagement <hi>[that which is not]</hi> unto theſe things? Are Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> no better accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation unto men than <hi>that which is not,</hi> are theſe things no waies ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able unto men?</p>
               <p>Yes ſurely they are; only God ſpeaking of them doth by them as men when any thing is bowed and ſtandeth bent, or crooked, they bend it a contrary way, that ſo it may be made ſtrait: So it is when the minds of men ſtand awry, and have crooked Notions concerning things, when mens Judgments put a highter value or eſtimate upon them than their natures (duly conſidered) will bear.</p>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:95016:251"/>
               <p>Now the Holy Ghoſt, under ſuch circumſtances as theſe, takes this wiſe and prudent courſe to rectifie the Judgments of men concerning them; he bends theſe (as much as may be) quite another way. And ſo becauſe the hearts of men have high thoughts concerning Riches, and the great things of the World, and are mightily intent that way; they think that Riches, Silver and Gold are to be laboured for night and day; therefore the Holy Ghoſt laboureth to bend mens Judgments on the other way, and to make them think that there is nothing at all in them but what may be compared to <hi>that which is not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or elſe the Emphaſis of this Expreſſion <hi>[that which is not]</hi> may very probable be in this; becauſe theſe things have a very little and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree of entity or being; that which they have in being is ſo little, and ſo inconſiderable that it was not worthy of compariſon with real exiſtence or being. It is the manner of the Scriptures, that when any great or round Sums ſet down or delivered, as Six or Seven Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds, or the like, if there be any fractions, as ſuppoſe four, five, or nine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not to take any notice of the Fractions, but only the round Sums: In like manner, that being which Riches have is in a manner nothing in compariſon of that which is reality, and ſubſtance, or being indeed; therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <p>Therefore for a man to ſeth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yet again, for a confirmation of the Notion under debate, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2. <hi>Wherefore do ye ſpend your money for that which is not bread: And your labour for that which ſatisfieth not?</hi> The ſpending of a mans money is the laying out of his gifts, and parts, and opportunities for that which is not bread, <hi>i. e.</hi> for that which is not ſo indeed, is not properly nouriſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it only nouriſheth for a ſeaſon. <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth</hi> (ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27.) that is, all the benefit that a man can hope to receive is only in this life; when he goeth down
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:95016:252"/>to the Grave, there is an end of all that he hath enjoyed in this kind.</p>
               <p>Here again, we ſee that the Holy Ghoſt expoſtulates the matter, is (as it were) full of paſſion (as a man that is offended) with this People, that, when as he had given them bread that would nouriſh them, and bring them up to eternal life, they ſhould lay out their money, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſpend their gifts, parts, and opportunities only upon that bread which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth.</p>
               <p>It is frequent in Scripture, when the Holy Ghoſt would reproach men in things that be irrational, thus to interrogate a reaſon or ground of what they do. I ſay unto you (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36.) that every man muſt give an account of every idle word that he ſhall ſpeak; they ſhall give an account, that is they ſhall be put upon it to give one. A reaſon that is good, and ſound, and ſubſtantial, will paſs, and God will give a <hi>quietus eſt</hi> upon it; but if it prove only a pretenſe, a hollow and empty ground, a fallacious reaſon that is given, this is that which will be the condemnation of the World in the day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>But the thing which we obſerve from hence is this, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> that there is no way or method ſo piercing, ſo apt to ſtrike with authority, and to awaken the conſcience of inconſiderate men as to put them to it to give a reaſon why they do thus and thus.</p>
               <p>If the Queſtion ſhould be put to all rich Wealth-Mongers, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour-mongers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What is the reaſon why they do toyl and ſpend themſelves about things that are of no value, whileſt they turn aſide from the purſuing things that are excellent, honourable, and worthy? Certainly, as of him that was asked in the Parable, <hi>Friend, how cameſt thou hither not having thy wedding Garment?</hi> It is ſaid that he was ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs: ſo would theſe men have nothing to anſwer. When mensactions are irrational, and have not a lively ſpirit of reaſon in them, if they ſhall be put upon it, and called upon to give a reaſon of what they do; this is the only way to awaken them when they go on in a ſottiſh and brutiſh courſe to call upon them thus; What doſt thou do, art thou conſcious of the Action, that it will bear thee out before a righteous Judge? If the man have any ſpark of Conſcience, or any degree of Reaſon left within him, upon ſuch an Interrogatory as this put to him, he will bethink himſelf, and when he hath gone about, and can find nothing that will paſs for a reaſon with God, nor with conſiderate and intelligent men; in this caſe, even by the Law of his Creation (in a manner) he is neceſſicated to take another courſe, namely, to deſert, and to retract that courſe and practice which he is in, and to betake himſelf to ſuch waies whereof he can give a reaſonable, and worthy, and a ſound account both unto God and men. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Be aſtoniſhed O ye heavens at this, and be ye horribly affraid; be ye very deſolate, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Such a paſſionate expreſſing of himſelf as this is doth

               <p>What is that the Holy Ghoſt doth uſher in by ſuch a Preface as this? What hath the Lord to ſay that ſhould put the Heavens to ſuch an aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment?

Suppoſe that it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for you to gain the whole World, and in the mean time you ſhould loſe your own ſouls; as All they will certainly do who are ſo intent to gain the World, that they have no reaſon, no underſtanding, no vigour
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:95016:253"/>of ſpirit to look after and to mind the great things of Eternity, or ſuch as this, a <hi>being filled with the Spirit.</hi> What will it <hi>profit you</hi> in caſe you have gotten the whole <hi>World?</hi> It implyeth, not only the invaluable diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the gaining the whole World and loſing their Souls; but alſo that mens laying out themſelves to gain the World is the ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone, upon which they ſtumble and loſe their own Souls. You have the World before you, and have Reaſons and underſtandings; now weigh and conſider it with your ſelves, there is the loſs of your ſouls. Do you know what this will amount unto? Do you know that the endeavouring to win the whole World will expoſe you to the loſing, or (at leaſt) the danger of loſing your own Souls? So that we may plainly ſee, that in theſe, and many ſuch like places in the Scriptures, the Holy Ghoſt maketh it matter of ſhame and great reproach unto men, to take off their Minds and Judgments from things that are of a moſt excellent and glorious import, that will ſtand by them for ever, and ſet them upon things of no value, nor continuance. Let us now ponder and weigh the Motive laſt inſiſted upon, and ſo diſmiſs it; if we know how to contrive, how to diſpoſe of our time, of our reaſons and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings (which muſt indeed be thoroughly engaged about this great Deſign of <hi>being filled with the Spirit</hi>) if we intend to effect this Deſign; If we know (I ſay) how to diſpoſe them otherwiſe, to a better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to more profit and advantage to our ſelves, then might we more reaſonably neglect, yea, and deſpiſe the Exhortation which with ſo much importunity hath been urged upon us: or if we knew any other prize to run for, which were in any degree worthy to ſtand in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with that recommended in the Exhortation, we might reaſonably ſtick and demur, and take into conſideration what we had beſt to do in the caſe; whether to lay our ſelves out about a <hi>being filled with Spirit,</hi> or upon ſome other account inconſiſtent with this: But if neither of theſe Lions be in our way, if there be nothing diſputably better than, nay, if there be nothing diſputably equal with a <hi>being filled with the Spirit,</hi> about which we can ſet the intellectual Faculties of our ſouls on work, how ſhall we not fall down before the voice of the Exhortation, which exhorteth us <hi>to be filled with the Spirit,</hi> without any more ado, and go forth with all our thoughts made and reſolved in the higheſt, that whatſoever ſhall be required of us, in a due order to a being thus filled, we will to the utmoſt of our power ſo do? When we may have Bread for our money, will we give it for Stones, or for that which will not profit or nouriſh? When we may with the ſame labour and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, both of ſoul and body, inveſt our ſelves with Priviledges and Poſſeſſions that are excellent and glorious, which will ſtand by us to Eternity, ſhall we accept of things of little or no value? Is not this for thoſe that are come to be men to reſume Childiſhneſs again? My Brethren, theſe are matters of very vaſt, yea, prodigious concernment
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:95016:253"/>unto you: The word that now hath been ſpoken in your ears will judge you in the laſt day. Let him therefore that hath an heart conſider what hath been now propounded unto him.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> To work your hearts to cloſe with the Exhortation deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the Duty recommended therein, you may pleaſe to conſider this one thing farther (which was lately touched on by the by) that you may riſe up early, and go to bed late, and eat the bread of much care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; you may ſpend the ſtrength of your minds and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to procure other accommodations and enjoyments, ſuch I mean, which relate to the outer man only, aad yet never eat the labour of your hand, nor ſee the fruit of the travel of your ſouls; or that which is little better, if not rather worſe, ye may only taſte of what you ſeek after in this kind, that which you ſhall take in hunting, and yet not be able to continue the enjoyment of it for any conſiderable ſpace of time. A day, an hour, yea, poſſibly a moment may bereave you of what the care and labour of many years advanced you unto; whereas firſt, it hath been already ſhewed and proved unto you, that whoever ſhall lay out themſelves for this ſpiritual and heavenly accommodation of <hi>being filled with the Spirit</hi> ſhall moſt certainly obtain it. Secondly, In perſevering in this courſe unto the end your attainments ſhall ſtand by you in glory and bleſſedneſs for ever. But as the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.10. <hi>The young Lions ſhall ſuffer hunger,</hi> &amp;c. ſo it is with thoſe that ſeek the glory and great things of this World, that purſue the Honours, and Wealth, and Pleaſures thereof; theſe many times ſuffer hunger and want. He that ſeeketh after Honour and Riches falleth ſhort, and ſo he that ſeeketh after Pleaſures is diſappointed: But he that ſhall ſeek to be filled with the Spirit of God, ſhall be filled therewith, neither ſhall any thing be able to ſeparate between him and it. And as the Apoſtle reaſoneth concerning the love of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Even ſo it is in the caſe in hand, neither life, nor death, nor any other thing, neither Trouble, nor Perſecution, nor Angels, no nor Devils ſhall be able to ſeparate and ſtep in between thoſe who ſhall engage themſelves in a conſciencious manner to be filled with the Spirit, and the actual accompliſhment and enjoyment of this felicity.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Ambition may work in you (as the Grace of God did in <hi>Paul</hi>) mightily; and yet of this Spirit you may reap nothing but diſhonour and diſgrace, and covering of the face with ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. <hi>Abſolom</hi> (as we lately intimated) ran with all his might, and with all his ſtrength for the Prize of a Kingdom; but that which he got by his running, was an ignominious and untimely death, being hung by the hair of his head on the bough of a great Oak, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.9. as he fled to ſave his life from the purſuit of <hi>Davids</hi> men, in which poſture three Darts were thruſt through his heart by <hi>Joab.</hi> Many ambitious Climers in all Ages have met with the like diſaſters and diſappointments.
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:95016:254"/>All Hiſtories (almoſt) fill the World with examples in this kind, that men before they come at the top of the Ladder fall down and are broken and cruſhed to pieces; they wholly miſcarry and get nothing but a covering of darkneſs inſtead of that grandeur or greatneſs which they lift up their hearts unto; and many who did compaſs the grandeur and greatneſs in the World which they ſought after were ſoon diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid concerning Riches, and of thoſe that in the ſweat of their brows, and burning of their hearts have ſought to ſit down and reſt themſelves under the ſhadow of a great Eſtate. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of his Country-men, the <hi>Jews,</hi> that following after the Law of Righteouſneſs, they attained not the Law of Righteouſneſs; ſo we may ſay of many, that following after Riches they have not attained to be rich: But whoſoever follow after this, being filled with the Spirit, have and ſhall moſt certainly attain it. Thoſe carnal deſigns are meerly acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental and caſual attempts which men often miſcarry in. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are full of ſuch Expreſſions, which ſufficiently confirm the truth of what we ſay; <hi>I returned, and ſaw an evil under the Sun</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Eccl.</hi> 9.11.) <hi>the Race is not to the ſwift, nor the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And ſo, <hi>There is that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty;</hi> many times their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects fail them, and they come to poverty. So that we ſee there is great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty in all theſe things, we do not know whether our deſign will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in our hand or no; for God hath not made any ſuch connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe carnal projects and their ends, but that he can forbid their coming together: But we have the Word of the Living God, the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heaven, that if any man will build a ſpiritual houſe, carry on a heavenly deſign, if they will lay out their hearts and ſpirits upon it, God will ſtand by ſuch men, their labour ſhall not be in vain. God hath eſtabliſhed a Law that ſhall not be broken, a Law like unto the Law of the Sun and Moon, which ſhall be kept inviolable, that he that deſireth to eat of this bread, ſhall have to eat abundantly; he, that ſhall run the courſe of this Deſign, ſhall obtain. He that giveth to every Seed his own body (ordinarily in things natural) will never fail, here he hath put a Law upon himſelf; neither will his nature give him leave to ſeparate and divide between the means that are ſpiritual, and the end to be attained by them. He that ſoweth the Seed ſhall reap the Fruit; whoſoever ſhall ask in this kind ſhall receive, and whoſoever knocketh it ſhall be opened unto him.</p>
               <pb n="481" facs="tcp:95016:254"/>
               <p>Now if you pleaſe but to conſider, in a word, the weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this Motive, you know that men do not love to ſow their Seed in vain; to part with their Silver and Gold for things that are of no uſe. It is every mans caſe, and they are accounted the wiſeſt of men that can prevent ſuch things, the interpoſure whereof is apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of that for which they have given their money. Now then, this is the caſe, as to the buſineſs we have been exhorting you unto, <hi>viz. A being filled with the Spirit;</hi> it is a Commodity, which if you will lay out your ſelves for, it will moſt certainly be made good unto you; it is not obnoxious to any diſappointment either by God, Angels, or Men. Now then, Why ſhould any man beſtow his time upon that which he may poſſibly not enjoy; or in caſe he may enjoy it, it will be but for a ſhort ſeaſon, or if he ſhould enjoy it for any long ſeaſon, yet at laſt it muſt go: all the pain and labour, all the care and travel of ſoul will periſh together? Oh how happy then, above all worldly Projectors and Deſigners, are they whoſe hearts are perſwaded to hearken to the Counſel of God concerning a <hi>being filled with the Spirit,</hi> even in this reſpect alſo (beſides many others) that they are certain of a good reward for their labour? They that run this Race ſhall certainly attain; they that ſeek to be filled with the Spirit ſhall be filled, whereas (as I ſaid) all endeavours, about worldly accommodations, are but loſt labour in compariſon of this.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVIII.</hi> The eighth (and laſt) Motive: That a being filled with the Spirit will render the Condition of men and women moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable in this World, and in that which is to come. That no other courſe will do it but this, or none without this. Four things, a concurrence whereof will render a man's Condition in this life moſt deſirable. <hi>1.</hi> A freedom from all troubleſome, diſtracting, and tormenting fears and cares. <hi>2.</hi> A heart and conſcience abounding in Joy and Peace. <hi>3.</hi> A large and free Communion with God. <hi>4.</hi> And laſtly, A rich and large inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God to be able to carry great Matters in Prayer with him. Three of theſe inſiſted on: <hi>1.</hi> A being filled with the Spirit will diſcharge men from all troubleſome and diſtracting fears and cares. <hi>2.</hi> The Peace and Joy of men will abound by a being filled with the Spirit. <hi>3.</hi> A third particular which renders mens Condition ſo deſirable in the World is a free and large Communion with God. <hi>1.</hi> What is meant by Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God. <hi>2.</hi> What by a free Communion. <hi>3.</hi> What is meant by a large and full Communion with God. <hi>4.</hi> How this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion renders man's Condition very deſirable in the World. <hi>5.</hi> That this Priviledge muſt needs accompany a being filled with the Spirit. What it is for God to dwell or abide in man. How a man may know that God dwelleth in him by the Spirit which is given him. How perfect love caſteth out fear. In what reſpest the Spirit may be ſaid to witneſs with our ſpirits that we are the Children of God. A well-grounded Confidence. The Cauſes of a falſe Confidence enquired into. A good Conſcience a ground of Aſſurance.</head>
               <p>EIghtly (and laſtly) To promote the intereſt of the Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on delivered in your Judgments and Conſciences, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> in your Hearts and Affections yet one degree further, you may add to to all the former Motives laid before you, to perſwade you to yield Obedience unto it, this one more, which amounteth to more than all the reſt. That to be filled with the Spirit muſt needs render your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, as well in this World, as in that which is to come, the moſt bleſſed and deſirable that Creatures made of fleſh and bloud are capable
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:95016:255"/>of enjoying; and that there is no other courſe will do but this only. In this Motive there are three things contained:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That a being filled with the Spirit will render the Condition of a man or woman in this life moſt deſirable, happy, and bleſſed in the higheſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That it will do the like for them in the World which is to come; it will render their Conditions and Beings here the beſt that this World alſo can afford unto the Sons and Daughters of Men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) That there is no other courſe, no other engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or employment, that a man or woman can lay out themſelves, and their time and ſtrength in, that will do either.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For the bleſſedneſs or deſirableneſs of the Condition in the World that now is there are are four things, a concurrent enjoyment of which muſt needs be conceived to make the State and Condition of a man or woman in the World very happy and deſirable.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, A well-grounded Vacuity or freedom from all trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, diſtracting, and tormenting fears and cares.</p>
               <p>Secondly, An Heart and Conſcience abounding in Peace and Joy upon the like terms.</p>
               <p>The third, A large and free Communion with God.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt, A large, and rich, and conſiderable intereſt in God, that can carry all matters of requeſt with him upon all occaſions. I ſuppoſe, if any man were in the actual enjoyment of all theſe four particulars, his Condition and State would be as deſirable as the heart and ſoul of a man can reaſonably, or with a true underſtanding, deſire in this World. Now, he that is filled with the Spirit of God will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with theſe four great bleſſings.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For a man or woman in this Vale of mortality and tears, to be out of the reach of troubleſome and tormenting fears and cares, to enjoy a conſtant ſerenity and tranquillity of mind without being afraid either of what man can, or God will do unto him; How great and happy muſt ſuch a mans condition be? Surely it is one of the ſpecial ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in the felicity and bleſſedneſs of God himſelf, as <hi>David</hi> taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.4. <hi>He that ſitteth in the Heavens ſhall laugh, the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion;</hi> meaning, his Enemies. My Brethre, For poor Creatures, who dwell in houſes of clay, and are compaſſed about with mortality to be in reſpect of their inner man, in reference to any troubles, or things formidable that may aſſault them; for them, I ſay, to have Communion with God in this heavenly priviledge, to laugh all troubles to ſcorn; to be like unto a Mountain, or a great Rock before Storms, and Tempeſts, and Whirlwinds; How glorious above meaſure muſt ſuch a State and Condition be? To have the heart and ſoul like the upper Region of the Air, where there are no diſturbances or commotions,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:95016:256"/>where to be (as I ſaid even now) they may be able to laugh all Enemies to ſcorn. Not to be afraid of what either men can, or what God will do unto them, this is a moſt Divine Priviledge; eſpecially, the obnoxiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and weakneſs in this kind of the generality of the hearts of men conſidered, it muſt needs be a very rare and high attainment for any to live out of the reach of fears. <hi>Fear,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>hath torment;</hi> and indeed (upon the matter) nothing elſe hath torment but fear; neither is it ſimply any preſent ſorrow or ſuffering, though very grievous, even as ſharp as nature it ſelf, is well able to ſtand under, that hath any torment in it; but fear proceeding from the apprehenſion of the danger of ſome miſery approaching in the future. Now, if we were but armed in our hearts by the fulneſs of the Spirit, no fear would enter in there; we ſhould have no cauſe to fear any danger for the future, and conſequently ſorrows and ſuffering would not much offend us; they would be but of a very light and paſſable conſideration, we ſhould not ſuffer any great matter upon the account of them. Our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.34. adviſeth thoſe that believe in him not to care for to morrow, telling them the morrow ſhall care for it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if we would but cut aſunder from us our cares, we ſhould eaſe our ſelves of much trouble. For this is that by which men and women ſpoile themſelves, in that they take up the care of many daies at once: Men will care for to morrow, and for forty daies together, whereas the care of one day, the evil, and trouble that doth attend it, is ſufficient unto it; but the effect of this care for the time to come is to fill with trouble and feare. There is indeed a fear, of which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14 when he ſaith, <hi>Happy is the man that feareth alwaies;</hi> and it is rather an evil, or a miſery to be freed from this fear than any matter of profit. But this we ſay, a being filled with the Spirit of God, a rich anointing with this oyl will reduce the heart and ſoul of a man to ſuch a paſs, to ſuch a temper and frame, that it ſhall be impenetrable, invulnerable by ſuch Arrows of cares and fears which are wont to pierce and ſtrike thorough the hearts of other men, and to ſlay all their comforts and peace. As there are ſome kinds of Oyls or Oyntments, as ſome have affirmed, which are ſo ſovereign againſt the impreſſions of hot boyling Lead, or the like, that they will ſecure men from receiving any harm by them, if timely applied: Whether this be true or not, yet in the buſineſs before us the Scripture it ſelf taketh notice of that great and marvellous effect of a rich anointing of the Spirit of God we ſpeak of. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.1, 2, 3. compared with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.1, 2, 3. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.6, 7, 8. <hi>The Lord is my light and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear? The Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom then ſhall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine Enemies and my Foes came upon me to eat up my fleſh, they ſtumbled and fell.</hi> Pſal. 46. <hi>God is my refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in time of trouble; therefore will we not fear though the earth be removed, and though the Mountains be carried
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:95016:256"/>into the midſt of the Sea,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo again, <hi>Though an hoſt of men ſhould compaſs me about, yet herein will I be confident,</hi> Now we may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive that theſe are very high expreſſions of a fearleſs and dreadleſs ſpirit, though the Earth be moved out of its place. The moving of the Earth, and toſſing to and fro of Mountains repreſent unto us things that are of a moſt terrible and formidable nature, and very aſtoniſhing to the World. We know the ſhaking of Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was ſo terrible that <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf is ſaid to fear exceedingly: And ſo an Hoſt of men is a thing which is moſt terrible, yet ſaith he in this caſe, though an hoſt of men ſhall come marching againſt me, yet herein will I be confident. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.6, 7, 8. <hi>Surely he ſhall not be removed for ever; The Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall be in everlaſting remembrance, he ſhall not be afraid of evil ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, his heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. That which will cauſe the hearts of other men to fear (namely, evil tydings) and cauſe them to ſhake and tremble like the Trees of the Forreſt when they are ſhaken with a mighty wind, will have no operation (at leaſt comparatively) upon the men and women of this Character which we are now ſpeaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> which are <hi>filled with the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Reaſon why a rich anointing with the Spirit of God muſt fortifie the ſpirit and ſoul of a man, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> to make it inacceſſible unto trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome cares and fears, is, becauſe it is a kind of ſpiritual intoxication anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a drunkenneſs with Wine (to which it is oppoſed) <hi>Be not drunk with Wine wherein is exceſs, but be ye filled with the Spirit.</hi> I conceive that by the oppoſition in this Compariſon the Apoſtles intent is to ſhew, that there is a likeneſs between a being filled with the Spirit, and being drunk with Wine: For as Drunkenneſs doth ſtupifie the natural ſenſes, doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave a man of the uſe and exerciſe of them, ſo that for the time he is not capable of minding his own Concernments, he is not affected with any thing that doth concern his ſtate or health, or any thing that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: Even ſo, or after ſuch a manner, a being <hi>filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> doth (as it were) bereave a man of his carnal ſenſes; it doth reduce a man in his mind and underſtanding to ſuch a ſtate that the Fleſh and the things thereof have little or no place in him, it caſteth him into a kind of heavenly extaſie, in which he is taken up with matters of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature, of a more high and excellent concernment; ſo that the things which concern him here in the World, either matters of trouble, or ſorrow, or any other thing or concernment whatſoever little move or affect him whileſt he is (as it were) in this heavenly extaſie; it doth (as I ſaid) bereave him of thoſe ſenſes, principles, and thoughts which other men abound withal who are accounted ſober men, and wiſe in their Generation in the matters of this preſent World. <hi>If we be beſides our ſelves</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13.) <hi>it is to God.</hi> There is no man that is filled with the Spirit of God but he is apt to do as one that is beſides himſelf; he doth not take knowledge, doth not mind, is
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:95016:257"/>not ſo much affected with ſuch kind of things as relate to himſelf, which other men (as it were) make their All in All, and according to the giving out of which, whether on the right hand, or on the left, they ſtand or fall, they live or die; they live if the World ſtand by them, if their Silver and Gold, their Health and Strength, and other enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments continue with them, but if theſe fail them, they are dead in the Neſt: But it is not ſo with him that is filled with the Spirit of God. For as it was with <hi>Lot,</hi> in his fit of Drunkenneſs, he neither perceived when his Daughters lay down by him, nor yet when they roſe up from him; ſo when a man is in his heavenly rapture, of a fulneſs of the Spirit of God, he doth not much mind, nor is much affected when the World lieth down by him, and beareth him company, nor when it riſeth up, and taketh its leave and departeth from him in one kind of enjoyment or other. Now, this being the proper nature and tendency of being <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> to ſtupifie and turn the edge of natural affections which occaſion trouble and ſorrow in the World, it muſt needs follow, that they who are in this ſtate muſt needs be under an heavenly ſecurity, and their hearts like unto the upper Region, where there is no impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any fiery Meteors, but a conſtant and uniform ſerenity and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity. In like manner is it with the heart and inward part of a man that is filled with the Spirit of God, there is no impreſſion of any ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or cares or tormenting fears; I ſpeak only of the uſual, habitual, and ſtanding frame and condition of ſuch a mans ſoul and ſpirit; it is one thing what God may do, or ſuffer to be done, in a caſe not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and in reference to ſome extraordinary end and purpoſe of his in the World. He may give way, and his Spirit may ſuſpend his own act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, though the heart and ſoul be full of him, and ſo there may be ſome weakneſs, and impreſſions of fear, and ſadneſs, or the like: But we ſpeak not of what ſuch a perſon may ſuffer at times, and in caſes not ordinary; but we ſpeak of the ſtanding and habitual frame of his heart and ſoul, and what this fulneſs of the Spirit doth for him, and what ſtate it putteth him in ordinarily. And doubtleſs, if it were not ſo, God would want one great Engine to draw and work up the hearts and ſpirits of men and women unto the heighth of holineſs. For if he would have men to be <hi>Noahs,</hi> and <hi>Jobs,</hi> and <hi>Daniels,</hi> I mean, to be ſignally excellent in faith and holineſs; if he would have men like unto the tall Cedars in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> he muſt accordingly propound and hold forth ſomething, by way of reward and recompenſe, that ſhall (as it were) draw and work them up above the common line, and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſtrain of the World round about them: For if he ſhould have no great priviledge to inveſt thoſe withal, whoſe labours, and endeavours, and diligence ſhould ſurpaſs the labour and diligence of other men in waies of holineſs and righteouſneſs, the World would be all of a level, and of the ſame pitch; the whole World of Chriſtians and Believers
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:95016:257"/>would be but men of a low ſtature. But now God, as he hath gone to work, having variety of conſiderations and rewards, ſome rich and glorious above others to propound unto men, he hath taken an effectual courſe to have the waies of excellency in holineſs and righteouſneſs often frequented and walked in; which otherwiſe would have been unoccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied by the Sons and Daughters of men, if he had not provided en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to excite, or ſtir them up thereunto. Therefore it is very reaſonable to conceive, that a being filled with the Spirit ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by God with ſome ſignal Priviledge, namely, by rendring them that are ſo filled free from troubleſome cares and fears above the Rate and Line of thoſe whoſe hearts will not ſerve them to riſe up unto it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Where there is a fulneſs, a rich anointing of the Spirit, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> there muſt needs be an abundance of Peace and Joy. This was a ſecond particular of the Four, a concurrence whereof muſt needs be conceived to make a mans Condition in the World as deſirable as fleſh and bloud is capable of. Freedom from care and trouble is a kind of Negative Peace; but it is but ſuch a Peace whereof irrational Creatures, yea, Inanimate Creatures are capable as well as mene; yea, thoſe that are dead have part and fellow ſhip in this Peace, according to that of <hi>Job</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>There the Servant is free from his Maſter,</hi> &amp;c. But that Peace which we now ſpeak of is ſomewhat poſitive, and hath a true and real exiſtence in the ſoul; it is a ſweet compoſedneſs of the mind, and ſpirit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a man, and this well built upon grounds of knowledge, by means whereof a man is whole and entire himſelf, and at perfect liberty to ſerve God and men, and himſelf in every good way and work: this is that Peace which we call a poſitive Peac, which hath Joy alwaies accompanying it. We ſhall not, upon the occaſion in hand, ſtand to ſcan the deſcription according to the ſeveral parts of it; this would cauſe too great a digreſſion; it ſhall ſuffice at preſent to know, that the Peace which we affirm to be a fruit or effect of a being filled with the Spirit is a very bleſſed and deſirable thing; ſuch a ſtate or conſtitution of the Spirit or ſoul of a man, which is a principal member, or part of that happineſs which a Creature whilſt he is cloathed with fleſh and bloud is capable of attaining or enjoying. Now, that ſuch a Peace as that, now briefly repreſented unto you, muſt needs accompany a being filled with the Spirit, is fully evident from the conſideration of theſe three things, one conſequentially following and depending on another.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He that is filled with the Spirit muſt needs act for God at an excellent and high rate of zeal and faithfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He that acteth for God at ſuch a rate as this is not much ſubject to be tempted, and yet much leſs to be overcome or drawn into waies or works of ſin by temptation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) He that is not overcome by temptation, nor
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:95016:258"/>drawn to provoke God by ſinning, cannot but enjoy much of that Peace of God which (as the Apoſtle ſaith) paſſeth all underſtanding. To open this a little by the way. A man who is of a large underſtanding may go on very far to conceive of the bleſſedneſs of a peaceable eſtate and condition; he may form to himſelf abundance of felicity, and ſet ſome kind of value thereon, and may compaſs much ground, and travel very far into this Land, yet it paſſeth all underſtanding; for when men have ſailed with their intellectual abilities very far, yet this Peace of God hath more in it; more for the comfort and accommodation of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than ever will be put to account, than ever will be drawn out by any underſtanding in men. But this only by the way. But to return.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> He that is filled with the Spirit, whileſt he is careful to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſo bleſſed a priviledge, muſt needs act at ſome high and more than ordinary rate of zeal and faithfulneſs for God: For what difference elſe can we reaſonably imagine to be between theſe that are filled with the Spirit, and thoſe who are not? And the Scripture it ſelf from place to place maketh it evident, that perſons filled with the Spirit of God have ſtill acted and done very much (as hath been ſaid) have promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and carried on the intereſt of God and of Chriſt with a high hand in the World; Yea, when any perſons did any thing above the ordinary Line of men for God or Chriſt, the holy Pen-men, who report and record theſe things, to make their report in this behalf the more paſſable and worthy of credit in the mind and thoughts of men, give notice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, that the perſons thus acting were men full of the Holy Ghoſt. Thus <hi>Luke, Act.</hi> 6.9, 10, being about to relate the Heroick Acts of <hi>Stephen,</hi> Firſt, In arguing and diſputing down the Synagogue of the <hi>Libertines,</hi> and other Sects; and then in his high Conteſt with the High Prieſts, and Elders, and Scribes, and others preſent at the Council, where he reproved them all ſharply to their faces, ſaying, <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed in heart and ears,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.51. (expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his life hereby to their malice and rage.) <hi>Luke,</hi> I ſay, the Sacred Hiſtorian of theſe magnifick Acts of <hi>Stephen,</hi> giveth ſpecial notice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, that he was a man <hi>full of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 6.5. <hi>And they choſe Stephen a man full of faith, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the greatneſs of the Actions might prejudice the belief of them in thoſe that ſhould read them; Whereas the Reader taking notice that <hi>Stephen</hi> was a man endued with more than ordinary Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from on High, full of the Holy Ghoſt, they might upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count look upon it as a thing no waies incredible that <hi>Stephen</hi> ſhould do, and ſpeak, and ſuffer for both <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> did. So likewiſe, when <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 13.9. in the Condition of a ſtranger, undertook the bold and high Conteſt againſt <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer (as he is called) a falſe Prophet, being a great Favourite (as it ſeemeth) to <hi>Sergiue Paulus,</hi> the chief
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:95016:258"/>Ruler of the Country (in the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus</hi>) there is expreſs mention made before-hand of his being full of the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Then Saul, who alſo is called Paul, filled with the Holy Ghoſt, ſet his eyes upon him and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. Implying, that ſuch a thing as this would hardly have been undertaken by <hi>Paul</hi> unleſs he had been carried on by the Spirit of God within him, and that by ſome conſiderable fulneſs of him. And this <hi>Paul,</hi> we now ſpeak of, <hi>laboured</hi> (we know) <hi>in the work of the Lord more abundantly than they all;</hi> he was (as we may ſay) the Lord Chriſt's right hand upon the Earth; he drove Sathan, the God of this World, before him from place to place, and triumphed over him every where, where he came; he was too hard for him, and caſt him down from heaven like lightning, and turned the affairs of his Kingdom upſide down, and laid waſt his power, made havock and deſolation in all the Territories which he had amongſt the generality of men. But how came it about, what was the reaſon why this Apoſtle ſo much, and to ſuch an high degree, over acted the Line of the Labours, Zeal, and Faithfulneſs of all his Follows? Queſtionleſs the reaſon was, he had a richer and fuller anointing of the Spirit than they; the Sails of his ſoul were filled with a ſtronger gale of the Spirit of God than theirs: him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth, in effect, give this account of his heroick and high Actings for Jeſus Chriſt in the World, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28, 29. <hi>Whom we preach</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>warning every man, and teaching every man, in all wiſdom, that we may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus; whereunto I alſo labour, ſtriving according to his working which worketh in me mightily;</hi> he labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for this very purpoſe, to preſent every man perfect in Chriſt, and he did it according to his working (namely, the Spirit of Chriſt) which did work in him mightily, or with power. Where obſerve by the way, that the Apoſtle ſaith that he did labour in conformity unto the mighty working of the grace of God, or of the Spirit of God in him; the meaning ſeems to be this, that the Spirit of God, that put him on, and <hi>Paul</hi> were both agreed, <hi>Paul</hi> as ready to go as the Spirit was to ſend. By this means <hi>Paul</hi> went on in all thoſe Heroick Actions which he did, and made great havock and deſolation among the powers of ſin, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unbelief in the World. By means (I ſay) of the Spirit, <hi>Paul</hi> ſubmitting himſelf unto him, and receiving his impreſſions, and going along with them, he was enabled to many great atchievements, and to labour more abundantly in the Goſpel, and for the intereſt of God and his glory in the World, and the good of men alſo, than any, nay, all the reſt of the Apoſtles; though they were men who were alſo very ſerviceable in their Generation. To inſtance no father, the Lord Chriſt himſelf, who was the Worthy of all Worthies that ever the great God of Heaven and Earth imployed in any ſervice upon Earth; who was the firſt-born Servant of God, and Elder Brother to <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf; who kindled a fire that never was yet quenched, nor ever ſhall be, until
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:95016:259"/>it hath conſumed all his Enemies; and laid a foundation in his own bloud to build up the Name of God in the greateſt glory amongſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men to the daies of Eternity: He (I ſay) was a man of theſe high and moſt tranſcendent Atchievements, by the advantage he had of all other men, in being filled with the Spirit above them all; according to that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. where it is ſaid, that God gave him the Spirit without meaſure; he was not only <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> but had the over flowing of the Spirit; never did any man attain unto his pitch of zeal and faithfulneſs to the ſervice of God. So that there is no queſtion, but that he that is filled with the Spirit is in a capacity to Act, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lightly but Act at a very high rate for God if be do but follow the motions of the Spirit of God, and will go along with them; then he cannot, I ſay, but be great in the ſight of God, great in the ſervices of Chriſt, and of his Saints. If you deſire to know the reaſon hereof, it is, becauſe, as the higher the wind bloweth, that Ship whoſe Sails are duly trimmed runneth ſo much the faſter, and riddeth the more way upon the Seas: Even ſo, when the heart and ſoul of a man ſhall be full of the Spirit of God, ſuch a perſon muſt needs be acted and carried on with more power, and vigour, in a ſwifter manner or courſe, and be enabled to do twice as much as another in the ſame compaſs of time, who hath but a ſcanty preſence of the Spirit of God with him. You know it is our Saviours Expreſſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> I ſuppoſe he maketh mention of being born of the fleſh only to ſhew, and make things more paſſable to the underſtanding of <hi>Nicodomus,</hi> to make way for that which he ſpake in the latter. Now ſaith he, <hi>that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh,</hi> that thou and every man knows; as the Parent that begetteth a Child is of a fleſhly nature, ſo that which is born muſt needs be fleſh alſo. And doſt thou not know, how a man ſhall be born again of the Spirit? It is even as it is with thoſe that be born of the fleſh, they partake of the ſame nature, and receive the impreſſions of the fleſh: So it is with the Spirit, that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit: Such as is the nature of the Spirit of God, ſuch alſo is that which is born or begotten of it, that is, thoſe Principles, whatſoever they are that he who is born of the Spirit doth receive, by means of the Spirit of God, muſt anſwer and be like unto thoſe which the Spirit of God himſelf hath, of which he is born or begotten. Now you know that the Spirit of God is full of the Love of God, and full of Zeal for God, and ſet upon the magnifying of him in the World, and promoting his Intereſt in the hearts of the Sons and Daughters of men. Now he that is born of the Spirit muſt needs act and be encli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned after the ſame manner; he will be zealous for God, beſtirring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his way, as the Spirit of God doth in his way. So then, this is the firſt thing we were to ſhew in order to a demonſtration or proof, that a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with the Spirit muſt needs be accompanied with abundance of
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:95016:259"/>peace and joy, <hi>viz.</hi> that he that is filled with the Spirit muſt needs be large hearted and highly active for God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which upon the ſame account we have to prove is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> that ſuch men and women, whoſe waies are thus on high (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) are not much obnoxious to temptations by Sathan, or however not like to be overcome by them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, We ſay, that perſons filled with the Spirit, and conſequently acting with an high hand, and great reſolution for God and for Jeſus Chriſt, are not, in this reſpect, ſo obnoxious unto temptations; I mean, are not ſo like to be aſſaulted, to be tempted by the Tempter. <hi>Sathan</hi> hath no ſuch encouragements from theſe men, they do not ſtand on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be tempted by him, as the far greateſt part of men and women in the World do, who go ſo to work in the things of God with ſo much deadneſs and laſineſs that they do upon the matter invite the Tempter. As we uſe to ſay, Opportunity makes a Thief; ſo the opportunity that men offer the Tempter (who is carrying on his intereſt in the World, to render it as miſerable as he can at preſent, and as miſerable as may be for Eternity;) maketh him ſo buſie with them: Whereas thoſe who are filled with the Spirit do (upon the matter) cut him off of all opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in this kind, and conſequently make him leſs careful or ſolicitous to ſpend his temptations upon ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon hereof is, becauſe he hath leſs hope to make any earnings upon ſuch men; the excellent Spirit, for waies and works of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs, which he continually diſcovers in theſe men, breaks the heart of his hopes of doing any good upon them, of prevailing over them. This obſerving of the wind keeps him from ſowing his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in thoſe fields. As a man, though he hath a Quiver never ſo full of Arrows, careth not to ſhoot them againſt a brazen Wall: So neither will <hi>Sathan</hi> the Devil care to throw his fiery Darts againſt thoſe who are ſo hard to come at, who are alwaies up, and out in the heighth of their ſpirits for God. For as the Scripture ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. he that ploweth, or ſoweth, ploweth and ſoweth in hope; meaning, that no man would either plow or ſow but in hope to reap: So neither will Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than care to plow or ſow but when he hath a hope of an harveſt. Now his Harveſt is nothing elſe but the ſin and wickedneſs of men, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were for this he would not care to tempt men. God of old gave this by way of motive and encouragement unto the Jews to cauſe all their male children to appear three times a year in <hi>Jeruſalem, viz.</hi> that he would <hi>caſt out the Nations before them, and enlarge their borders;</hi> and as a fruit and conſequence of this he adds, <hi>Neither ſhall any man deſire thy Land when thou ſhalt go up to appear before the Lord thy God thrice in the year,</hi> Exod. 34.24. When I have taken ſuch a courſe by magnifying thee, by enlarging thy quarters, then no mans heart ſhall deſire, or think of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering of thee. So when God hath filled men and women with his
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:95016:260"/>Spirit, and by means hereof hath raiſed and enlarged their hearts to any Heroick kind of acting and converſing in the World, and hath removed ſin and wickedneſs far from them, there is no deſire of enſnaring or foyling them like to come up into the heart of Sathan. And therefore it was that the Lord Chriſt was led by the Spirit into the Wilderneſs to be tempted by the <hi>Devil, Mat.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.1. He had an anointing of the Spirit of God above all his Fellows, and therefore the Devil had no mind to ſet upon him with any of his Temptations, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were upon ſome ſpecial advantage; and therefore he was led aſide into a very deſolate and howling Wilderneſs, amongſt the wild Beaſts (as <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith) there were ſome Wilderneſſes amongſt them that had Towns, but this was altogether without Inhabitants. All which clearly implieth, that the Devil had no mind to Duel with him, but upon ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial advantages, as his being ready to ſuffer thorough hunger, his being amongſt wild Beaſts, in a place remote from men, altogether without Inhabitants; for otherwiſe, what neceſſity was there that the Lord Chriſt ſhould be led aſide into the Wilderneſs but only in order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? He continued faſting forty daies, and afterwards when he was an hungry then he fell upon him. So likewiſe, the Devil, obſerving how mightily the Grace and Spirit of God wrought in <hi>Paul,</hi> had (queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs) the leſs edge to beſtow time upon him in tempting of him; and <hi>Paul</hi> was little other in <hi>Sathan's</hi> eye than a brazen Wall, againſt which he cared not to ſhoot. It is true, the Apoſtle reports, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. how there was given unto him a Meſſenger of <hi>Sathan, a thorne in the fleſh, leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure.</hi> But firſt, That which is here termed a <hi>Meſſenger of Sathan,</hi> and deſcribed to be <hi>a thorn in the fleſh,</hi> is ſaid to have been <hi>given him</hi> [meaning, by God,] <hi>i. e.</hi> to have been by a ſpecial interpoſure of God diſpoſed to him, not in order to a perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any ſin (which the greateſt part of the Devils temptations are) but to the preventing of it,</p>
               <p>From whence (by the way) it clearly enough appears, that the thorne in the fleſh, here ſpoken of, was no laſt of uncleanneſs, nor any ſenſual concupiſcence, becauſe then <hi>Paul</hi> would not have ſaid that it had been given unto him; But doubtleſs it is rather meant of ſome falſe Apoſtle that endeavoured to undermine him. Haply it may be it was ſome Chriſtian Friend, that did <hi>Paul</hi> a diſpleaſure, that did undermine his credit in one kind or other; but however the very end for which the Meſſenger of Sathan was given him, it was not to draw him into ſin, but for the preventing of ſin, as he ſaith, <hi>leſt I ſhould be exalted above meaſure;</hi> or leſt he ſhould conceive an opinion of himſelf above that which was meet for him to conceive.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It appears that Sathan was in one kind or other over-acted by God in ſending ſuch a Meſſenger, and that the Temptation was over-ruled by ſome hand of God alſo. Thus it appears in the ſecond place
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:95016:260"/>why thoſe that are filled with the Spirit of God are not obnoxious to be tempted by the Devil, and that the Devil is not much enclined to tempt ſuch perſons as we ſpeak of. This appeareth further from <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Reſiſt the Devil, and he will flee from you.</hi> What is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtle but this? <hi>viz.</hi> Give him a ſhort, and ſharp, and abſolute anſwer, and you ſhall not long be troubled with him: for the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> knows his time is but ſhort, it is ſhorter by many degrees now than it was then; the Devil hath no time to ſpare, nor to trifle away, and therefore it is like he will not loſe his labour nor time where he is reſiſted.</p>
               <p>But in caſe ſuch perſons who are filled with the Spirit ſhall at any time be tempted, they are not ſubject, or likely to yield unto the Temptations. The reaſon of this is, as the Apoſtle informeth us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16, 17. <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. That is, go along with the Spirit of God, hearken to his motions, and they that be filled with him cannot lightly but go along with him. The Spirit reſiſteth the Fleſh, and being in his might he is able to overcome the fleſh; whileſt the Tide of the Spirit runneth ſtrong it beareth the ſtream and current of the Fleſh down before it, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.4. <hi>He that is in you is greater than he that is in the World;</hi> the Spirit coming in with the fulneſs of his Power, though the Fleſh ſhould attempt to carry men into waies of unworthineſs, yea, though the Devil ſhould by his temptations ſtrengthen the fleſh; yet nevertheleſs, he that is in them, the Spirit of God is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more mighty than corruptions are, or than the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is. This is the ſecond thing propounded, <hi>viz.</hi> that they that are filled with the Spirit are not obnoxious to be tempted unto ſin, or however not ſo obnoxious to be overcome by temptations, as others are who have but a ſcanty preſence of the Spirit of God in them.</p>
               <p>The third (and laſt) follows, which is, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> that they who are not ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto temptations, or unto ſinning by temptation, are like to enjoy much peace, much of the peace of God which paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and of that bleſſed ſtate of inward joy which is <hi>unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi> Now this is that which we are to prove unto you from the Scripture; and likewiſe ſound reaſon will ſtand by us in it. That joy and peace which is raiſed by the Holy Ghoſt is far greater than the joy that men can take in ſilver and gold; theſe kind of objects affect the heart but little comparatively: or if the hearts of men ſhould be ſo affected with theſe things that they run over with that peace and joy which can be drawn from them; yet this then joy is but groundleſs, a joy that hath no ſubſtantial ground, it is ſuch as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll nor ſtand by you, it will ere long be gone, and the end of that joy will be ſorrow: But that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is the joy of the Lord is when that paſſion of joy riſeth and ſprings up in men and women from the root of holineſs, and by
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:95016:261"/>means of ſuch objects which they converſe withal which are great and excellent, and of a ſpiritual nature, and will bear them out in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or degree of rejoycing: And as ſpiritual objects work upon, and move mens affections to an excellent height, ſo will men alſo be conſtant and uniform in their joy and peace which is thus raiſed in them: unleſs the working of this their joy and peace be interrupted by men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by behaving themſelves unworthily towards God and Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us Chriſt; all the things in the World beſides cannot do it.</p>
               <p>When the Conſcience teſtifieth with a loud voice, that a man hath lived holily, and walked humbly with his God, hath been obedient unto him in all his waies and commands; it cannot be but that upon ſuch a teſtimony a man muſt, like unto <hi>Jordan</hi> in the time of harveſt, overflow with joy and peace. <hi>Mercy</hi> (as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.13.) <hi>rejoyceth againſt Judgment;</hi> a Conſcience teſtifying to a man that he hath been merciful, that he hath done much good, that hath miniſtred like unto himſelf, according to the ability which God hath given him; ſuch a conſcience as this doth make a man to rejoyce againſt <hi>Judgment.</hi> Now then, if this one courſe of worthineſs be ſo great an advantage unto men and women, how much greater is it when there is not only this particular way of worthineſs, but when this ſhall be ſtrengthened with another excellent way, and another, and another to that, when a man ſhall have this Teſtimony in his conſcience, that he hath not only been a merciful man, but alſo that in other things he hath walked uprightly and perfectly before his God; that he hath not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted himſelf, neither by any unmercifulneſs of Spirit, nor with any of the waies and practices of this World? When there is ſuch a conſort of heavenly practices met together, theſe will enable men to magnifie themſelves againſt the fears of death, and make men ſtand like Princes before God, undaunted and unapaled. This then is the ſecond of the four particulars, a concurrent enjoyment whereof cannot lightly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but that they muſt needs render a mans ſtate and condition of life in this World excellent and deſirable.</p>
               <p>The third thing, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> which we told you muſt needs render a mans ſtate and condition in the World deſirable, was a free and large Communion with God. Now firſt, that ſuch a priviledge and enjoyment as this muſt needs contribute richly towards the rendring a mans ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in this World (for of this only we ſpeak at preſent) excellently contentful, ſatisfactory, and deſirable in the higheſt unto him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That this priviledge muſt needs accompany a being filled with the Spirit, and be poſſeſſed and enjoyed by all thoſe who are thus filled, may be made to appear by a little conſideration. But by the way give me leave to ſhew you firſt, What I mean by Communion with God. Secondly, What I mean by a free Communion. Thirdly, What I mean by a large or full Communion with God. Fourthly, To make

               <p>Firſt, Then by a Communion with God, I mean, an inward and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual converſe or intercourſe of the ſoul with God, or a recourſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unto God upon all occaſions for direction, help, or comfort from hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> together with a readineſs in God to correſpond in all ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s theſe. I confeſs, Communion with God, taking the word <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> in a large ſenſe, extendeth farther than any thing now expreſſed, and comprehends ſomewhat more, <hi>viz.</hi> a mutual or reciprocal propenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between God and the Creature, to ſympathize the one with the other, according to the condition of their mutual affairs reſpectively, whether proſperous or adverſe; and true it is that this Communion alſo intercedes between God and him that is filled with his Spirit: But in the Point before us we chiefly intend the other, <hi>viz.</hi> a capacity or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of recourſing unto God for ſolace, help, and direction, together with a willingneſs or readineſs in God to correſpond or maintain intelligence with a perſon accordingly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, By a <hi>free Communion</hi> in this kind, I mean, a recourſing unto God from time to time for the ends and occaſions ſpecified; (as <hi>Paul</hi> did) with a liberty and freedom of Spirit, with a Princelike boldneſs, without any mixture or touch of fear, of that kind of fear which hath torment in it; when a man hath no ſtand in his faith, but is able to cry, or to cry out aloud (as the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> properly ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) without any faultring or fainting, <hi>Abba Father,</hi> Rom. 8.15. or when a man (in another expreſſion of the ſame Apoſtle) is able to come boldly to the Throne of Grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. fearing no colours, as our common ſaying is; when a man can have part and fellowſhip with thoſe holy Angels who behold the face of God continually, though with fear, yet with peace and joy alſo. Now this we mean by a free Communion, when a mans heart is ſo ſettled, and ſo compoſed that he hath no incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance upon his faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By a large <hi>Communion with God,</hi> I mean, when a man or woman hath further dealing with God than ordinary, when by reaſon of the largeneſs of a mans knowledge of him, and of his nature and Counſels, he hath the opportunity of treating with him about more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and receiving anſwers from him touching more particulars like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and conſequently, as his knowledge of God encreaſeth and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth ſo his Communion with God is enlarged and advanced accordingly. Thus you ſee what we mean (in the buſineſs in hand) by Communion with God, and by a free and large Communion with him.</p>
               <p>Now then we are to ſhew and make good unto you, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> that they who are filled with the Spirit are in an immediate and ready capacity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying both; both a free, and full, and large Communion with God.
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:95016:262"/>For the firſt of theſe, that which muſt needs afford an opportunity for a free Communion with God is, Firſt an aſſurance of the attonement and peace made with God by Chriſt, or by the bloud of Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, The teſtimony of a good Conſcience upon good grounds that (humane frailties only excepted, which come not into an account in the caſe we now ſpeak of) a man hath walked (and reſolveth ſtill to walk) in ſincerity and ſimplicity of heart before him in his whole courſe. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ow then, if he that is filled with the Spirit be poſſeſſed with both theſe, or liveth under the ſweet influence of them, he muſt needs be in a good capacity of a free Communion with God. Now that perſons who are filled with the Spirit muſt needs be poſſeſſed of ſuch an aſſurance of their attonement and peace made with God by the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, appeareth thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He that is filled with the Spirit muſt needs know that God dwelleth or abideth in him (as the Scriptures ſpeak.) Secondly, That he truly and really loves God; and from both theſe he cannot lightly but conclude his actual attonement with God by Jeſus Chriſt. And thirdly (and laſtly) beſides theſe, the Spirit himſelf dwelling richly in him ſtrongly teſtifies and witneſſeth as much in a direct manner unto him, or unto his Spirit.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He that is filled with the Spirit muſt needs know that God dwelleth or abideth in him, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. <hi>And he</hi> (ſaith <hi>John</hi>) <hi>that keepeth his Commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him: And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he hath given us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But firſt, What is it for God to abide and dwell in a man? And ſecondly, How, or upon what account do men, or may men know that God doth dwell in them by the Spirit which he hath given unto them?</p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt, God may be ſaid to abide or dwell in a man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when they are ever and anon acted and drawn forth, upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions which lie in their way, to ſerve him, and to do buſineſs for him; and this with the ſame readineſs of mind, delight, and faithfulneſs, as himſelf could be ſuppoſed to do, if he were in their places and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; ſo that what a man or woman doth in this caſe for God, a ſtander by may reaſonably think that God himſelf did it (as in a ſenſe it is true that he doth do it) and not they; for he ſtands at their right hand aſſiſting of them. I conceive, the meaning of the Scriptures when they ſpeak of Gods dwellng in men, it may be conceived after ſome ſuch manner as this. Two Friends live in two Countries far remote, many a hundred miles perfonally diſtant one from the other: now it muſt be ſuppoſed that theſe two Friends knew one another, and each of them muſt alſo believe that the other is in being, by which means theſe two Friends have a dwelling one in the heart of another: And in this ſenſe
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:95016:262"/>Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in men by faith, which is making way to the other dwelling. As ſuppoſe a man that is in a remote Country beyond the Sea, hath a very good Friend dwelling here; and he hath much buſineſs to be looked after in this Country where his Friend lives: Now if this Friend beyond the Seas dwell in his Friend here, in his heart and ſoul, this man will be drawn, by means of his Friend that dwelleth in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to look after what is for his benefit and advantage. And ſo likewiſe, if he dwell in his Friends mind and ſoul who is beyond the Seas, he will act there upon the ſame account for the benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this Friend alſo. Now what is the reaſon why a man is drawn forth with ſo much diligence and carefulneſs to mind his own buſineſs, but becauſe every man dwells in himſelf, every man has an indwelling in his own heart and ſoul? Sometimes indeed, and in ſome caſes, men dwell out of themſelves, and depart from themſelves; as we uſe to ſay, a man dwells where he freely and heartily loves; becauſe he doth not ſo much mind his own affairs, being gone out of himſelf to that which is beloved: In ſuch a Senſe as this God is ſaid to dwell in a man, when a man for Gods ſake, or by means of that indwelling of God in him is acted and drawn forth to mind and look after the occaſions and affairs of God in the World, to look after the concernments of his Kingdom and glory, and of his truth, and of his ſervants, and the like. So on the other hand a man may be ſaid to dwell in God, when God, out of that love which he beareth unto him, will act and give out himſelf freely for his ſatisfaction and peace, and for the reducing his condition unto a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable poſture: I ſay, in ſuch a caſe a Believer is ſaid to dwell in God. Now, that it is a duty lying upon us both to abide or dwell in Chriſt, or God, and ſo to have God dwelling in us (there is the ſame reaſon of Gods abiding in us, and of our abiding or dwelling in him:) That theſe (I ſay) are things to be provided for, and procured by men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (I ſtill mean by thoſe means and helps which are vouchſafed by God in order hereunto) appears from that admonition of Chriſt, from <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4, 5. <hi>Abide in me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>and I in you, i. e.</hi> Let me abide in you: or, and I will abide in you. <hi>Abide in me,</hi> take ſuch a courſe, remember your ſelves, conſider what you have to do, that you may abide in me. And in the next verſe, <hi>He that abideth in me, and I in him, bringeth forth much fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what doth Chriſt mean, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> when he admoniſheth his Diſciples <hi>to abide in him?</hi> What is it that he preſcribes them to do for their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in him? For it is not to be ſuppoſed, or thought, that they could abide in him by doing nothing; no, nor yet that they ſhould abide in him ſimply by abiding in him; as if their abiding in him could or ſhould be a means of their abiding in him: Therefore when he doth admoniſh them <hi>to abide in him,</hi> his meaning is (as we now ſaid) that they ſhould take ſuch a courſe, and uſe ſuch means whereby they might abide in him.
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:95016:263"/>What this courſe or means is, by which men may abide in God and Chriſt, is laid down by the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.24. <hi>He that k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So that when Chriſt exhorteth his Diſciples to abide in him, his meaning is nothing elſe, but that he would have them keep his Commandments, and by that means they ſhould manage their own occaſions by his love, and by his power, and wiſdom; and he would manage his oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ons with their hands, and with their hearts, and with their affections. <hi>Abide in me, and I in you;</hi> if we take it Proviſory, <hi>Abide in me,</hi> and know that I ſhall then abide in you, or let me abide in you, or that I may abide in you. I confeſs, this is a good and proper ſenſe; For the latter Clauſe, <hi>and I in you,</hi> implieth, that there is no man hath any dwelling in Chriſt, but that firſt Chriſt hath his dwelling in him. For it is not man that ſtandeth and knocketh at the door of Chriſt's heart, but it is Chriſt that firſt ſtandeth and knocketh at the hearts of men: If any man openeth unto him, then Chriſt cometh in and dwelleth there; as ſoon as the Creature doth but open the door and give him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, Jeſus Chriſt cometh in, and taketh up his abode, and then giveth him who openeth unto him place in his heart alſo: And ſo there are two Friends looking after and minding the affairs one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is true, the Creature hath the advantage of it: For ſuch a Friend as Jeſus Chriſt is of ten thouſand times greater concernment and advantage unto him than he can be unto Jeſus Chriſt; yet nevertheleſs, as he hath many great and weighty occaſions, which cannot be tranſacted or managed by any other hand but only by Jeſus Chriſt, I ſay, cannot be managed by himſelf alone, nor unleſs he abide in Chriſt, and have ſuffcient place in his heart and ſoul. So on the other hand, Jeſus Chriſt (as the Deſign of God is now laid) hath much buſineſs that cannot be managed nor carried on but by ſuch a kind of Agent or Inſtrument as the weak and contemptible Creature man is: I ſay, Jeſus Chriſt hath much to do in the World, which cannot be tranſacted according to his mind and deſire without the hand and heart of the Saints be in it to carry on the Enterprize. He hath the World to convince of ſin, his Enemies to be confounded, and their mouths ſtopped; He hath Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns and Examples of Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs to be held forth and exhibited unto the World: He hath his Goſpel to be preached, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, and propagated in the World ſo long as the foundation of it ſhall ſtand. Now theſe are his Engines which he muſt make uſe of to carry on his intereſt in the World; and as it was ſaid concerning the Aſs, that ſilly Creature, the Lord had need of him, and therefore his Owner muſt let him go, to fulfil a great Prediction that was before of him: Even ſo Chriſt continually ſtands in need of the helping hand, and of the hearts and affections of the Children of men; therefore he doth exhort his Diſciples that they ſhould take ſuch a courſe that they might
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:95016:263"/>dwell in him, and that he might dwell in them; and that he might not be put out of them. Now when men ſhall cool and decline in their affections unto Ghriſt, and unto the truths of the Goſpel; when they ſhall take in any other Inmate or Indweller, whoſe intereſt ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt, and whom they ſhall be more ready to ſerve and obey; this is to diſcharge, and not ſuffer Jeſus Chriſt to dwell any longer in them. But on the other hand, when men ſhall give this Inmate or indweller Jeſus Chriſt good entertainment in their hearts and ſouls by bringing forth much fruit unto him, this will ſtrengthen his hand to make his abode there. Now where Chriſt thus dwelleth in a man, that he ſeriouſly minds his intereſt and affairs, Chriſt on the other hand, by means of this mutual cohabitation, dwelling or abiding of a man in him, will alwaies be ready to mind his occaſions, to do him good, to project his peace, comfort, and advantage in every kind. Now then, inaſmuch as it is a matter of very great conſequence to the Believer that he ſhould be active and operative for God; ſo it cannot be thought but that Jeſus Chriſt will put him on, and be his remembrancer from day to day of that which is his duty to do; he hath not only an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of being fruitful that way, but to be fruitful according to that degree of intereſt that Jeſus Chriſt hath in him. So that he that dwelleth in Chriſt muſt needs bring forth much fruit, becauſe Chriſt will not be wanting unto him to quicken, and to ſtrengthen him, and to give him wiſdom to do all things which he is called to do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> How do we come to know that God dwelleth in us by the Spirit which God hath given us?</p>
               <p>I reply firſt, By the Spirit which God is here ſaid to have given us, is not meant (I conceive) directly, and immediately the Holy Ghoſt, or the Spirit of God, but rather that Spirit which is begotten or born in us, of, or by the Spirit; for the Spirit of God is wont to beget another Spirit in man in his own Image and Likeneſs, according to that of the Goſpel of <hi>John, That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit</hi> (as we lately interpreted;) that which is born of the fleſh is of a fleſhly nature, and hath all the properties of the fleſh, heavineſs, and dumpiſhneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the Spirit of God doth reſemble that Spirit which doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it. Now, as the Spirit of God, that begetteth this Spirit in a man, is holy and pure, a Spirit of Love, and Meekneſs, and Gentleneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Even ſo is that Spirit which is begotten, a Spirit of Meekneſs, Love, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reaſon why I rather thus underſtand the word Spirit (in the place before us) is firſt, becauſe this ſpirit (I mean) the ſpirit of a man, wrought and new framed within him by the Spirit of God is the more immediate principle of a mans actions, and the Spirit of God (in this reſpect) the more remote, becauſe he produceth
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:95016:264"/>and worketh all our good works by the mediation of that Spirit, or new frame of heart which he hath raiſed in us. Now then, that Spirit which hath the more immediate conjunction with, or influence upon our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is more eaſily diſcernable by us; and conſequently more proper to diſcover, or make known that which is diſcoverable by it, as the dwelling of God in us (in this place.)</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Holy Ghoſt doth not diſcover himſelf, or his preſence in a man (at leaſt not his ſanctifying preſence of which we now ſpeak) but only by that ſpirit which he begetteth in his own likeneſs (as hath been ſaid) and by the Fruits, or Works of the Spirit. For who can ſay upon any competent grounds, I have the Spirit of God in me, unleſs he find the frame of his heart, and the temper of his former ſpirit changed within him, and this for the better? He that ſaith he hath the Spirit of God in him, upon any other ground or account, ſpeaketh he knows not what, nor hath any man reaſon to believe him. Now then, if the Holy Ghoſt be not manifeſtive of himſelf, or of his own preſence in men, but only by that ſpirit which he begets or creates in men, and by the works which this Spirit produceth in them; but this Spirit, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the works which it produceth, is plainly manifeſtive of it ſelf, and conſequently of all other things which muſt of neceſſity accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it (amongſt which the dwelling of God in men is one:) It clearly follows, that this is the Spirit by which the Holy Ghoſt himſelf here ſaith, that we know that God abideth, or dwelleth in us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That Spirit in a man which muſt declare and evidence Gods dwelling or abiding in him, muſt be a Spirit conſtantly, or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually abiding in him: Now the conſtant and habitual abiding of the Spirit of God in thoſe who have received him cannot be known but only by that habitual frame of heart, out of which they act; for otherwiſe, there is a remaining of the Spirit of God in them which is not ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; many had the Holy Ghoſt in them to work Miracles, but the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying preſence of the Holy Ghoſt in men cannot be known, but only by the habitual and bleſſed frame of heart out of which they act in the waies of God; and therefore in this reſpect alſo it is moſt likely that the Holy Ghoſt meaneth the ſpirit which is begotten in the hearts by this Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly (and laſtly) This Spirit we ſpeak of, which is begotten in men by the Spirit of God, may be ſaid to be given unto us by God as well as the Holy Ghoſt himſelf. For as God, when he gave Chriſt unto men, may be ſaid to have given them all things appertaining unto life and ble<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

<pb n="501" facs="tcp:95016:264"/>with the Spirit cannot but know that God dwelleth and abideth in him; and this was the firſt thing mentioned, which muſt needs poſſeſs and fill men with a rich aſſurance that their attonement and peace is made with God by the bloud of Chriſt. For moſt aſſuredly God dwells in no man but in him who believeth in him. And ſecondly, Whoſoever believeth in him, his attonement is compleat with God. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (and laſtly) the man or woman in whom God dwelleth either knoweth or readily may know that God dwelleth in him.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing propounded, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> whereby a man or woman may know that their attonement or peace is made with God, and they accepted, was, if they love God; they that truly love God, and know they love him, may from hence readily conclude, and take hold of an aſſurance, that they have peace with God. This is evident from that known paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. <hi>There is no fear in love, but perfect love caſteth out fear; becauſe fear hath torment, he that feareth is not made perfect in love.</hi> There is no fear in love, <hi>i. e.</hi> with love, or where love is found: The Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is oft uſed for <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Firſt, It is evident, that he ſpeaks here principally and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the love of God in men. Secondly, By <hi>perfect love</hi> he means love grown to a good maturity and ſtrength in the heart and ſoul of a man; when it is active and bringeth forth a conſiderable proportion of fruit. <hi>By perfect love</hi> here he cannot mean love which is abſolutely and compleatly perfect, which is not capable of any more intenſeneſs or further enlargement; for there is no ſuch love of God to be found amongſt men that dwell in houſes of clay, no, not among the greateſt of the Saints; yea, it is a queſtion, whether the love of the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>be perfect</hi> in this ſenſe or no. The word perfect and perfection are moſt frequently uſed when applied to man, or any other Creature, not in a ſtrict or abſolute, but a limited and diminutive ſenſe. Things are ſaid to be perfect when they are grown to any good degree of perfection; So he that offendeth not in word is ſaid to be a perfect man, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. that is, it is a ſign that he is an able Chriſtian; ſo love to God, when it is grown to a conſiderable ſtrength in a man that it yieldeth forth fruit in abundance, then it is called perfect love; and I do not remember where the word is otherwiſe uſed when applied to the Creature or things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it. Indeed when applied to God it is to be taken in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, but when applied to the Creature in a lower ſenſe.</p>
               <pb n="502" facs="tcp:95016:265"/>
               <p>Thirdly, It is here ſaid, that the love of God when it is perfect (in the ſenſe declared) <hi>caſteth out fear;</hi> meaning, that the Genius or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of this holy and heavenly affection is to work or caſt our fear [<hi>viz.</hi> that kind of fear which hath pain, or torment in it, as he preſently expreſſeth himſelf] <hi>perfect love caſteth out fear, viz.</hi> when it is ſet on work, and imployed accordingly; for no paſſion, or affection in man acteth or moveth, but only upon ſome apprehenſions or other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to that affection, eſpecially ſpiritual affections, or affections when ſpiritualized, and as ſuch, do not produce the effects that are moſt natural and proper to them, but by the mediation and engagement of the underſtanding. The reaſon hereof ſeems to be, becauſe ſuch affections as theſe, are not natural unto men, but are as it were grafted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted upon, or into their natures by the Spirit of God, aſſociating himſelf in the work; by means whereof their effects and conſequents, eſpecially ſome of the richeſt, and choiceſt, and moſt excellent of them are like ſtrangers unto them; they cannot be produced by the affections themſelves but by the intervening of the Reaſons, and Judgments, and Underſtandings of men conſulting with the Scriptures or Word of God. Now where ſuch affections take place in men, the affection is ready to produce the fruit that is natural and proper to it; ſo that when it is ſaid, <hi>Perfect love caſteth out fear,</hi> it doth not import that this is alwaies done, but only that it may be done, that there is that in the nature of love that is ſufficient and proper to do it. We lately gave you this Rule, that <hi>Verba agendi quandoque naturam ſeu vim tantùm innuunt,</hi> Verbs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſignifying action many times only declare the natures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of things, and what they are able, apt, and likely to do; as when the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>knowledge puffeth up, but charity, or love edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. the meaning is not, that knowledge alwaies puffeth up, but only it importeth, that there is a kind of property in knowledge which is apt to puff up. And ſo when he ſaith, <hi>Charity edifieth,</hi> the meaning is not, that this grace is alwaies working thus, but it only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the genius of this famous grace, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is apt to provoke men and women to ſeek for their ſpiritual enri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So here, <hi>Perfect love caſteth out fear, i. e.</hi> it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and property of love to caſt fear out of the heart, <hi>viz.</hi> when it is grown perfect in the ſenſe lately declared.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> but if it be the nature or property of love to caſt out fear, Why is the effect here appropriate unto perfect love, and not rather unto love ſimply in what degree ſoever? Things that are eſſential to the nature of things are not ſuſpended upon their degrees.</p>
               <p>To this I reply, if the act or effect here ſpoken of, the caſting out of fear, did proceed ſimply and ſolely from <hi>love,</hi> let the degree of it be what it will; doubtleſs, love in the loweſt degree of it as well as in
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:95016:265"/>that perfection or ſtrength here required would do the ſervice: But as, in another caſe, faith is ſaid to act or work by love; ſo in the caſe in hand, Love in caſting out fear worketh by knowledge. As thus, a man muſt not ſimply love God, but he muſt know he loveth God; for otherwiſe our love to God will not be found to have ſuch power to caſt out fear; as a Sun-Dial, the uſe and end of it being to ſhew the time of the day, yet will do nothing in this kind but only when the Sun ſhineth upon it: So it is in this caſe, if the love of God be in the heart of man, yet if it be not ſhined upon by the underſtanding, and ſo have ſtrength and vigour added to it, it will be inſignificant, and do nothing towards the caſting out of fear. Or as the Well of water near <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 21.19. did not refreſh her, nor miniſter any hope of life until ſhe knew where it was: So likewiſe is it with the love of God, if it lieth unknown to the mind of a man it will be as if it were aſleep, it will not ſtir, nor do any thing that is worthy of it. If a man or woman, who loves God but a little, yet really and truly, could cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know that they do thus love him; this lower degree of this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction would caſt out fear. So that the reaſon why this great effect of caſting out fear is appropriated to love, when it is perfect, is, becauſe uſually it is not (nay, it very hardly can be) known but only where it ſheweth it ſelf like the Sun in the Firmament of Heaven, otherwiſe a man will be alwaies queſtioning whether he love God yea or no. Now when a man cannot be thoroughly ſatisfied that he loves God, it cannot be that his love ſhould caſt out fear. But if he have the knowledge that he loveth God, this love of God, though but ſmall, would caſt out fear as well as the other which is perfect.</p>
               <p>If it be further demanded, But why ſhould love, though perfect, caſt out fear? What is there, or what may there be conceived to be in the nature of it that ſhould have that kind of antipathy againſt fear, ſo as to remove, and not to ſuffer it to abide in the heart and ſoul?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, The reaſon of this effect, as proceeding from love, is to be found as well in the nature of that fear, which is caſt out by it, as in love it ſelf, or the nature hereof. For it is not the property of love to caſt out every thing elſe as well as fear. Therefore the Reaſon, at leaſt ſomewhat of the reaſon why it worketh here by way of antipathy, doth depend upon the nature and genius of this fear; and the reaſon here given of this effect of love is in reference only to the nature of fear. <hi>Perfect love</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>caſteth out fear,</hi> becauſe fear hath Torment; ſo that it is that fear which is apt to offend, grieve, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and diſcourage the hearts of men, that is caſt out by perfect love. But why ſhould that fear which hath this property in it, namely, to torment, give an opportunity to love to throw it out of the hearts of men? The Reaſon hereof again is, becauſe the love of God is a grace
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:95016:266"/>of ſuch high acceptation with God, and renders thoſe, wherever it is found, Friends of God; and God is not willing that any of his Friends, any of thoſe that love him, ſhould taſte any thing that is grievous or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive unto their peace; and therefore he hath given perfect love this property, he hath put enmity between this principle of love in men, and between whatſoever doth pain, or trouble, or torment them; and whatſoever it hath of this kind of property to diſcharge all fear that hath torment in it, it hath by Commiſſion from God. And the very truth is, that if we would examine the buſineſs, we ſhould find, that as fear hath torment, ſo there is nothing that hath torment in it but fear, or nothing without fear; all ſickneſſes and pains in the body, if you could but divide fear from them; they would not torment at all; if a man did not fear the continuance of them they would not diſquiet nor trouble him. Now it is the effect of love that it doth remove from the hearts and ſouls of men whatſoever is of a diſquieting import unto them. The truth is, that love would do ſo amongſt men, were it perfectly known or underſtood: If I knew that this man did know that my heart was perfect with him, and that I did entirely love him, I would not fear that that man would willingly do me any harm. So then this is one reaſon why love to God caſteth out fear, becauſe that a man by this means is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily perſwaded concerning God, that he is ſo good and gracious that he will not fall heavy upon his Friends, thoſe that love him. Yea, it is impoſſible that any ſuch thought of God ſhould enter into the heart of ſuch a man to think that God ſhould deſtroy any that do love him, and ſeek his honour and glory, or that he ſhould not do them good, and ſeek their peace and ſafety. The Apoſtle takes this for a Principle that no man will gainſay, <hi>That all things ſhall work together for good to thoſe that love God,</hi> Rom. 8.8. This is a Principle which we all agree in, that Gods love is ſuch to thoſe, that we cannot think but that all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and all his Providences ſhall be Tributaries to them. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place then it is evident from the Premiſſes, both latter and former, that he that is filled with the Spirit cannot but know that he loves God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) The third thing mentioned, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> which (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in conjunction with the two former) muſt needs ſatisfie any man of his attonement with God, is the direct and immediate Teſtimony of the Spirit of God himſelf in man, teſtifying together with a mans own ſpirit [<hi>i.e.</hi> with his heart, ſoul, and conſcience] that this attonement is made, and he accepted by God: this is the Apoſtles expreſs Doctrine, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirits that we are the Children of God: The Spirit it ſelf,</hi> or the Spirit himſelf, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. the Apoſtle by this Emphatical expreſſion, the Spirit himſelf, ſeemeth To imply, that the thing or act which he ſpeaketh of, is of a moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy nature and import, of a ſacred conſequence, and ſuch as well
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:95016:266"/>becometh him, who is the Agent or Actor of it, the Spirit of God himſelf. But what is that worthy thing which the Apoſtle here attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to ſo great an Agent as the Spirit of God? It is a witneſſing with our Spirits <hi>that we are the Children of God;</hi> which ſignifies as much, as that our Attonement is made, and that we are at peace with him; it ſignifies this (I ſay) and ſomewhat more. Well, out how are we to conceive of that act, here aſcribed unto the Holy Ghoſt, his witneſſing this to, and with <hi>our Spirits</hi> that we are the Children of God? The Expreſſion of <hi>witneſſing with our ſpirit</hi> plainly implies, that it is but one and the ſame Act of <hi>witneſſing,</hi> or witneſs-bearing, which is here joyntly or in common aſcribed unto the Spirit of God, and the ſpirit of men; and that the Spirit of God doth not bear any ſuch witneſs, as that here mentioned, apart from the Spirit of men, or when this doth not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs alſo. From whence it appears, that the witneſſing, or joynt-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing of the Spirit, here ſpoken of, is only a fortifying, ſtrengthening, raiſing, and enriching of the Witneſs or Teſtimony of a mans own ſpirit: So when the heart, and ſoul, and conſcience of a man ſhall with more than ordinary ſtrength, power, and authority teſtifie unto, or perſwade him that he is the Child of God; Or rather thus, when a man ſhall find himſelf perſwaded and poſſeſſed upon theſe high terms, with ſuch an apprehenſion, it is a ſign that the Spirit is in this perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that it is he that giveth the vigour, and all that which is more than ordinary unto it. As the ſtream and current of a River is doubled and trebbled in the ſwiftneſs of the motion, and in the depth and breadth of it when the rain-water, or the waters of a Land-floud joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the ſame motion with it, making together one and the ſame ſtream: In like manner, when the apprehenſion or perſwaſion in a man of his being a Child of God magnifies it ſelf at a high rate againſt fears, and doubtings, and jealouſies, in every kind, it argues a Conjunction of both Spirits, the Spirit of God and the ſpirit of man himſelf; and that which is ſo over bearing, and over-ruling in this perſwaſion is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriately from the Spirit of God; according to that of our Apoſtle immediately preceding the words in hand. <hi>But ye have received the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption,</hi> by which, <hi>or whereby we cry Abba, Father. We cry,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i.e.</hi> cry aloud, or with all our might (as we lately noted the proper import of the word.) Now to cry aloud <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> ſignifies the inner man calling of God Father, or a mans addreſſing himſelf unto God as unto a Father with a good courage or Princelike confidence. A mans own ſpirit (I mean, with ſuch an aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God as the weakeſt Chriſtian hath) may whiſper, or ſecretly mutter, <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> But by the way, this is to be remembred.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That when the Apoſtle ſaith, that by the Spirit, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> which we have received by the Goſpel, we cry <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> he is not ſo to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, as if he meant, that every one who hath received of the Spirit of
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:95016:267"/>Adoption, in any meaſure, were in a capacity hereby to cry, much leſs actually did cry aloud, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> upon the terms lately expreſſed; but he means, that that Spirit which was ſent down from heaven to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Goſpel, and the Miniſtry of it, might be received, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and entreated by men and women as that they might become en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and enabled by him to cry <hi>Abba, Father.</hi> Things uſe to be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and eſpecially commended by the beſt and richeſt of their fruits, and by what they are ſerviceable for when they are in their perfection, and not by their mean or leſs conſiderable fruits and ſervices. As the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle commending and ſetting forth the excellency of love, or Chriſtian Charity, ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5, 7. (among other things) <hi>Charity doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evil.</hi> And again, <hi>Charity beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things,</hi> &amp;c. His meaning in theſe deſcriptions and commendations of <hi>Charity,</hi> is, not to imply that Charity in any degree qualifies men for theſe high and excellent deportments of themſelves in the World; or as if perſons in any degree charitable did perform all theſe worthy things in their perfection: But that the nature of charity is ſuch, and that the means vouchſafed by God, to advance this grace in their ſouls, are ſuch, that men and women may be raiſed and enlarged in it to ſuch a perfection or degree as to be in a capacity of doing all theſe great and excellent things formerly mentioned. So when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have received the Spirit of Adoption whereby we cry Abba, Father;</hi> his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not, that every one who received this Spirit in any meaſure or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree doth actually thus cry, or is in a preſent and immediate capacity to do it; but that this Spirit being once received may be ſo comported with, and entreated by men, as that he will advance his preſence to ſuch a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or degree, that they ſhall be able by means of that ſtrong teſtimony to cry <hi>Alba, Father.</hi> This is the firſt thing to be remembred by the way.</p>
               <p>A ſecond thing, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>15</label> is that when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That the Spirit</hi> (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God) <hi>witneſſeth with our ſpirits that we are the Children of God</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi> (as we expounded) mightily fortifies and ſtrengthens that Teſtimony of our own ſpirit in this behalf,] He doth not ſuppoſe that every man and woman, who are more than ordinarily raiſed in this perſwaſion or apprehenſion of themſelves [I mean, that they are the Children of God] receive the abundance of this teſtimony or perſwaſion from the Spirit of God. For very poſſible it is, that men and women, who are not the Children of God, but far from it, may be very ſtrongly and confidently perſwaded that they ſtand in this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto God: But certain it is, that ſuch a perſwaſion as this in ſuch perſons cometh not either in whole, or in part, from the Spirit of God; becauſe he never joyneth in any Teſtimony whereby an untruth is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. There may be another Spirit, a Spirit of deluſion, that ſtandeth at their right hand, ready to fall in with them at ſuch a turn
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:95016:267"/>as this, and (it is like) will make their perſwaſion great within them; Our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.2. giveth an account of ſome that would think that they did God good ſervice when they put to death the Diſciples of Chriſt, one of the moſt horrid Acts of Impiety which could lightly be committed. And the Jews themſelves, with whom the Lord Chriſt had to do in the daies of his fleſh, were as high and as confident, as confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it ſelf could make them, that they were the Children of God, yea, the firſt-born Children of God; and if there were no more Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God in the World, yet they muſt needs be of this Generation. Now moſt true it is, that this confidence in ſuch perſons is, in a ſenſe, ſupernatural too; for certainly the Spirit of Error and Deluſion, which ſtandeth at the right hand of ſinful and unworthy perſons, doth ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt this unto them, that they are the Children and Saints of God, and falleth in with them after the manner of the Spirit of God; and if he finds but the leaſt mutterings or whiſperings this way in ſuch perſons (whoſe ſpiritual eſtate and condition he knows much better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do) he will fall in with might and main (according to his manner of working and operation) to help to raiſe and fortifie this perſwaſion in them; he will give them of this Wine to drink until their ſenſes be bewitched and beſotted, and by this means their Judgments and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings bear them in hand with the higheſt confidence that they are the only Sons and Daughters of God; and therefore we muſt take heed, and learn to diſtinguiſh, and not believe the confident teſtimony and aſſurance which ſome will pretend unto, of being the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God; we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh between the Spirit of God himſelf, and the Spirit of Error and Deluſion, who (as I ſaid) doth but lie in wait to hear the Spirit of a man whiſper (whom he knows not to be a Child of God, but to be a wicked, proud, formal, and hypocritical perſon) and then he will fall in amain with him to ſtrengthen his confidence: And therefore in reſpect of the degree and meaſure of his confidence (haply) it may be as well with him that is deluded by Sathan, as it is with him that is ſtrengthened and raiſed by the Spirit of God himſelf; Yet, in reſpect of the manner of it, and ſeveral circumſtances that do attend this falſe perſwaſion and confidence, it may eaſily be diſcerned from that which is true. The Apoſtles ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. of ſome perſons that were vainly puft up with their fleſhly minds, whoſe hearts were not eſtabliſhed with grace, but with meats; meaning, that theſe carnal obſervations had puffed them up with ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thoughts of themſelves. Therefore it is to be conſidered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that the perſons, with whoſe Spirits the Holy Ghoſt joyns in Teſtimony that they are the Children of God, are only ſuch who are the Children of God indeed, <hi>i.e.</hi> who approve themſelves for ſuch by an innocent, blameleſs, and fruitful Converſation, and particularly, who reverence the Counſel and Appointments of
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:95016:268"/>God in the Miniſtry of the Goſpel, by attending hereupon from day to day.</p>
               <p>If we had time we might give this <hi>Item</hi> unto you, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> that the Spirit of God, which doth bear up the heart and conſcience againſt all fears and doubtings, and contrary apprehenſions, and the like; this Spirit (I ſay) is received by the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt and the Miniſtry of it, even as it was in the daies of the Apoſtles. <hi>Received ye the Spirit</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 3.2.) <hi>by the Works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> It was the hearing of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, by which the Spirit of Adoption entred into them; and this Spirit came down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Goſpel from heaven, to attend and accompany that in the Miniſtry and the Preaching of it by the Apoſtles, and others that had part and fellowſhip with them in that work. Even as the Spirit of fear or bondage (which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of) went forth or iſſued into the World by the Miniſtry of the Law, and upon the giving of it upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> unto which the Apoſtle alludes when he ſaith, <hi>Ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear;</hi> meaning, that they had received it, namely, in their Fore Fathers, when they were in their loyns; <hi>But now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you have received</hi> (namely, by the Goſpel, and the Miniſtry thereof) <hi>the Spirit of Adoption, by which you cry Alba, Father.</hi> Now then, when you ſhall find men and women that are full of confidence and aſſurance that they are the Children of God, if this Spirit have entred into them upon the hearing of a falſe Goſpel, or upon the Preaching of another Jeſus, and not the Chriſt of God, this is a dangerous ſign that it is a Spirit of Deluſion that poſſeſſeth and filleth them with a windy confidence that they are the Children of God, when indeed they are not; becauſe the Spirit of God is not wont to go forth, nor to enter into the hearts and conſciences of men, but where the glorious Goſpel of God is received in the truth of it. We could inſtance in ſome particulars, for there are (as the Apoſtle telleth us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. in his daies in reſpect of Gods and Lords) many that were Gods and Lords ſo called, but (ſaith he) unto us there is but one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the truth is, at this day there are amongſt us, and round about in this City, and near to us Goſpels many, and Preachers many; but in the mean time, there is but one Goſpel for us, for thoſe that know the truth as it is in Jeſus. And yet many of theſe Goſpels, we ſpeak of, have their ſpirits that do attend upon them; and for the moſt part they do wait upon theſe very Goſpels and Miniſtries that are the rankeſt of all others, filling the Receivers of them with the greateſt aſſurance and confidence that they are the Children of God, and in the right way of worſhipping and ſerving of him.</p>
               <p>There is a Goſpel which joyns Baptiſm with Faith in Chriſt by way of neceſſity to Juſtification (and ſo to Salvation;) even as the Jewiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts did Circumciſion in the Apoſtles days, of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith unto
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:95016:268"/>them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.2. <hi>I ſay unto you, if ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing;</hi> meaning, if ye be Circumciſed with an opinion of being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified thereby, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing.</p>
               <p>There is another Goſpel preached amongſt us, which teacheth you (in effect, and underhand, yea, by expreſs and near-hand conſequence) that if you be elected, how looſely, wickedly, prophanely, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately ſoever ye ſhall live, yet you are in no danger of periſhing; yea, and that however you ſhall go to work, God will bring you in one time or other; and that he will ſo far change the ſtate of affairs with you that you ſhall neither will nor chuſe but to repent, and ſo be ſaved: together with ſeveral other Doctrines and Notions of like dangerous conſequence and import.</p>
               <p>Again thirdly, Another Goſpel (ſo called) ye have preached amongſt you, which calleth you from the Scriptures, and the light of life which ſhineth there, unto that which they call a light within them (though that light be never ſo dark;) As if the Scriptures and the light within men, ſo far as it is light, and not darkneſs, were at odds: Or as if the conveying of Scripture light into the hearts and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men were like to obſcure, darken, or obſtruct, and not rather to encreaſe, brighten, and perfect that light in men. This kind of Goſpel is of as dangerous conſequence as any of the other.</p>
               <p>A fourth Goſpel preached abroad in the World is, that all that ever will or ſhall be juſtified were juſtified from Eternity; and that upon this account God ſeeth no ſin in them. Yea, there is a Goſpel which preacheth down all Preaching, and denieth the uſefulneſs thereof. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Goſpels there are (ſo called in the World) which though they be at great variance amongſt themſelves; yet they all agree in enmity and oppoſition to the true Goſpel of Chriſt; like <hi>Sampſon's</hi> Foxes. But there is no end of enumerating theſe high, and by kind of ſtrains which men run into from day to day, thinking thereby ſtill to better their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition Godward. As you find many in a lingring condition with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that think if they ſhould but change into ſuch a Room, or into ſuch a Bed, they ſhould be better: So when men have not made a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and conſciencious improvement of the true Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, whileſt they did attend and live under the Miniſtry and Preaching of it, but find themſelves disſatisfied in their hearts and ſouls, and not enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves upon terms of that content which they deſire; they think now, that if they do but go forth into ſuch other waies, and walk in ſuch other paths, that then they ſhall be made great, then they ſhall reign like Kings and Princes in the Profeſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. Now the great Enemy of their Peace, and of the Salvation of their ſouls, lies in wait to meet with ſuch occaſions and advantages as theſe are; and therefore if ſuch Notions do but begin to bud, and put forth in their firſt
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:95016:269"/>conceptions, or that the hearts of men do but begin to hanker that way, the Devil helps them with his perſwaſions to go on; and then men are very apt to be perſwaded that now the Spirit of God is come to them, and that he doth procure them that great peace of God which they could never attain nor find from his hand before. I cannot paſs by that Expreſſion (though but lately handled, in the Scriptures now opened) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, becauſe it carrieth in it ſo pregnant a Teſtimony againſt that dangerous Doctrine, which of late hath began to make head amongſt us, <hi>viz</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt is not God. Now if it be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Spirit himſelf, and not any other inferiour ſpirit ſubſervient unto him, who bears witneſs with the Spirits of the Saints all the World over that they are the Children of God; then can he be no other than God himſelf who filleth all places with his preſence.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ſee a third thing, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> by means of which they that are filled with the Spirit muſt needs be poſſeſſed with an aſſurance of their attonement and peace made with God by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> they have the Spirit of Adoption within them, teſtifying aloud, and with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with their ſpirits that they are the Children of God, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that their ſins are fully attoned in his ſight. And this was the former particular of the two propounded, by which men and women muſt needs be prepared, and put into a rich capacity of enjoying free Communion with God. We ſhall not need (I ſuppoſe) to add any thing to prove or ſhew, that a clear aſſurance of a mans Attonement made with God opens an effectual door unto him for a free Communion with God. This is lightſome and evident enough of it ſelf, eſpecially if we take the word Attonement in a compleat ſignification; I mean, as it includes and carrieth with it grace and acceptation of a mans perſon with God. For when God is actually reconciled unto a Creature, and hath accepted an attonement for his ſin, He doth not only ceaſe to be an Enemy unto him, remaining ſtill as a Stranger, or as one from whoſe anger or diſpleaſure the Perſon reconciled and attoned is indeed free, but hath no further intereſt in him; but upon this ſaid reconciliation unto this Creature he becometh a moſt real Friend unto him, and admits him into his ſpecial grace and favour. Amongſt men it is oft times otherwiſe, a man doth not remain an Enemy after Attonement, for that properly is imported in the word Attonement: But in our Attonement with God there is another thing included, and is inſeparable from it, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intereſt in the love and favour of God. Indeed with men (as I ſaid) the caſe may be otherwiſe, when there hath been an Attonement and Reconciliation made between two perſons at a diſtance, yet they may remain as ſtrangers one unto another; there is no neceſſity that upon the making up of the breach there muſt be intimate love and friendſhip: But it is otherwiſe with God; he never comes to be reconciled unto any, but preſently he opens his heart and ſoul, and doth entreat them graciouſly
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:95016:269"/>upon their attonement made. Now then, if men, for whoſe ſins God hath accepted the Attonement made by Chriſt, be not only delivered from all danger of ſuffering by his diſpleaſure; but further, be received and entertained into the greateſt reſpects of love and friendſhip; Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it is, that they who are poſſeſſed of, and do enjoy theſe two Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, eſpecially being aſſured of their poſſeſſion in this kind, are in a good capacity of enjoying free Communion with God: What ſhould there be to hinder? And he that is <hi>filled with the Spirit,</hi> as he muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be in the poſſeſſion of both, cannot but know that his Attonement is made with God; and ſo (as we have lately ſhewed) he muſt needs have aſſurance alſo that he ſtands thus poſſeſſed of them. Yet</p>
               <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> There was another thing mentioned as proper to compleat that capacity we ſpeak ſo much of, (I mean, of enjoying free Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God. This was the teſtimony of a man's Conſcience, upon good grounds, that he walketh not, nor alloweth himſelf in any known ſin, either of Commiſſion, or Omiſſion whatſoever, no, not in the ſin of neglecting to enquire after the good, and holy, and perfect will of God concerning him. He that is armed with this Breſtplate of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs may ſtand, like a Prince, before the great God of Heaven and Earth; for he hath the greateſt ſecurity that Heaven lightly can give him, that he is in favour with God. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21. <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God;</hi> if our hearts, <hi>i.e.</hi> our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, <hi>condemn us not</hi> [<hi>i.e.</hi> by a Metonymie of the Effect put for the Cauſe; if our Conſciences do not charge ſin upon us, do not upbraid us with voluntary and habitual neglect of, or diſobedience unto the Command of Chriſt] <hi>then have we confidence,</hi> or boldneſs, or liberty of face, or of ſpeech (as the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, more properly ſignifieth) <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</hi> By the way, the Apoſtle is here to be underſtood of ſuch perſons whoſe hearts or conſciences are in ſome meaſure enlightned with the knowledge of the waies and Precepts of God, and more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with the knowledge of his Precept or Command of believing in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, as it followeth in <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>And this is his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that we ſhould believe in his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For otherwiſe, many mens hearts may not condemn them, yea, may (poſſibly) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend and juſtifie them who yet have not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, any confidence, at leaſt not any right or ground of confidence (as ſome expound the word) towards God. The hearts of thoſe (I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtanced) who thought they ſhould do God good ſervice in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Diſciples of Chriſt to death, did not condemn them, at leaſt in this; and if not in ſo great and broad a ſin as this, poſſibly not in any other; yet had they no right or ground of boldneſs or confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. So likewiſe they, of whom the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. in this Chapter, and gives this Character, that they were <hi>vainly puft up
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:95016:270"/>in their fleſhly minds; whoſe hearts were eſtabliſhed</hi> (as he ſpeaks elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) <hi>not by grace, but by meats;</hi> it is like their hearts did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, yet had they not ground of confidence towards God. So alſo <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf had confidence enough in himſelf when he had no ground, when he thought he ought to do many things againſt the name of Chriſt. Therefore we muſt needs limit the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage before us, to perſons who have ſome competent knowledge of the Goſpel, and of the great things contained in it. And indeed, if we look narrowly to it, he ſeems to ſpeak appropriately unto ſuch, and of ſuch only. <hi>Beloved, if our hearts condemn us not,</hi> &amp;c. And whereas, being underſtood of ſuch, he ſaith, <hi>Then have they confidence towards God;</hi> his meaning is not, that all ſuch actually and <hi>de facto</hi> have this <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> but that they have a right to it, and ground for it, and upon conſideration and enquiry may have it. As many things in Scriptures are ſaid to be done by men, when it is meet they ſhould do them, or have a good ground or reaſon for the doing of them. Thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8. <hi>If we be dead with him, we believe that we ſhall live with him. We believe, i.e.</hi> we have ground or reaſon ſufficient to believe, that we ſhall live with him. So 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.29. <hi>If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doth righteouſneſs is born of him, i.e.</hi> of God; <hi>i.e.</hi> ye may know there are means in abundance whereby ye may know, that he who doth righteouſneſs, and he only, <hi>is born of God;</hi> meaning, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from him according to this new capacity, or new birth, which is nothing elſe but a participation of the Divine Nature. As Children have Communion with their Parents in their nature: ſo he that doth Righteouſneſs is partaker of the ſame Nature with God and Jeſus Chriſt. And ſo when God ſaith, ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.19. That he <hi>will command his Children, and his Houſe after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord;</hi> he doth not ſuppoſe, that they would certainly keep the way of the Lord; for we know many of them did otherwiſe, and were caſt out of his ſight; therefore this is not ſpoken by way of ſtrict Propheſie, as if God had foretold what <hi>Abraham's</hi> Houſe and Family, and Poſterity after him ſhould do it: and therefore the meaning muſt be, that they had ground in abundance to have done what <hi>Abraham</hi> commanded them, <hi>viz.</hi> to keep the way of the Lord. Now then, when he ſaith, <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God;</hi> he clearly implies, that where the <hi>heart</hi> of a man or woman doth (in the ſenſe declared) condemn them, <hi>i.e.</hi> charge them with the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary and willing practice of any known ſin, or neglect of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, there can be no place for any boldneſs or confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. The reaſon is, becauſe fear and dread of Divine Diſpleaſure follows the conſciouſneſs of ſin; as the ſhadow follows or attends the body in the Sun. It doth not indeed alwaies follow ſin, becauſe ſin many times is committed where it is not known: but wherever it is
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:95016:270"/>committed with knowledge, or againſt knowledge (for theſe are the ſame in the caſe we ſpeak of) there it is alwaies accompanied with ſome impreſſions or other of God's diſapprobation or diſpleaſure, until the ſinner hath recollected himſelf by repentance, and ſought the face of God. Thus then we ſee, that the teſtimony of a good conſcience, eſpecially in conjunction with the aſſurance that a man's Attonement is made with God, muſt needs inveſt him with a rich capacity of enjoying a free Communion with God. If you ask, Why ſhall a man's not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned by his heart (upon the terms ſpecified) give him a right, or be a regular ground of boldneſs, or <hi>confidence towards God?</hi> I reply, Becauſe as fear of ſhame and puniſhment from God are the natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of ſin, eſpecially of ſin againſt knowledge (as we lately intimated:) So is expectation or hope of reward, or countenance from God the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſult of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs; neither can God himſelf ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate between theſe things, I mean, Righteouſneſs and hope of reward, but only by ſuch a kind of interpoſure by which he ſhould ſeparate heat from the fire, or light from the Sun, as God may in a miraculous way ſtand between the natural force of things; as when time was he ſtood between the heat and the fire: For Righteouſneſs and Holineſs are of that nature, that he that ſhall put forth his heart and hand to do them, doth in a natural way fill his heart with hope of reward, and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from God. See upon this account, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9, 10, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19.20, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This for the ſecond particular, found in thoſe who are filled with the Spirit, the teſtimony of a good conſcience; which muſt needs, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally being joyned with the former aſſurance of a man's Attonement made with God, compleat his capacity of enjoying free Communion with God. That all thoſe, who are filled with the Spirit of God (in the ſenſe formerly declared) cannot want the Teſtimony we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is (I ſuppoſe) ſo clear and manifeſt from the contents of what hath been formerly declared upon the Scripture in hand, that I conceive it no waies neceſſary to inſiſt upon any further proof of it.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, To demonſtrate, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>19</label> that a <hi>being filled with the Spirit</hi> doth yet further contribute to the raiſing our happineſs in this preſent life by inveſting us with a capacity of enjoying Communion with God, we added, that it muſt needs inveſt us with a capacity of a large and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Communion alſo. Now, a free Communion with God (as was formerly in effect ſaid) imports a liberty or freedom from any trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, tormenting, or diſcouraging fears in our converſings with God, and in our application of our ſelves unto him; whether by way of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, or Contemplation of any of his glorious Attributes or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; or whether by Prayer, or Requeſt; or whether by way of expectation or dependence upon him for matters relating to this life, or that which is to come. Now, in any of theſe three works (I do not
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:95016:271"/>remember any but what is reducible to one of theſe) when a man or woman is at liberty, and this upon good grounds, to do all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear (I ſtill mean, without any ſuch fear which hath trouble, pain, or torment in it) this I call a poſture or capacity of a free Communion with God; and this capacity we have already ſhewed and proved, that alwaies it accompanies ſuch a being filled with the Spirit as that unto which you have been exhorted. Now as men and women filled with the Spirit are capable of ſuch a Communion with God as this, ſo are they, by the ſame means and opportunity, capable of an enlarged Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God: They are in a condition of converſing with God in all the three kinds, lately ſpecified, after a more large and ample manner, and about more particulars, and theſe more ſpiritual and ſecret, and matters of a more high importance than they whoſe anointing with the Spirit is more ſparing and low. (Now to help you a little to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the difference;) a child of three or four years of age may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be as free in his Communion with his Parents, may go unto them, and ſpeak unto them, and hear them ſpeak again unto him, with as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fear or trouble as his brother who is come to maturity of years, and is a man grown: But yet by reaſon that ſuch a Childs underſtanding is at perſent ſhort and ſcant, in compariſon of his Brothers, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the things and affairs of men, which the Child doth not, or but very weakly and imperfectly: Therefore the Childs Communion with his Parents is not ſo large, extends not to ſo many particulars of ſuch weighty concernments as his elder Brothers Communion doth. I make uſe of this Compariſon, only to explain the difference between that which I call free, and that which I call a full or large Communion with God; not to imply that, he that is in a capacity of enjoying the one, may be in no capacity of enjoying the other: For it hath been already ſaid, that he that is <hi>filled with the Spirit</hi> is in a capacity of enjoying both. This Propoſition we have proved as to the former, <hi>viz.</hi> A capacity in ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of enjoying a free Communion with God; we now go forward to the proof of the other, <hi>viz.</hi> that the ſame perſons are in a capacity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the other alſo: an ample or large Communion with God (in the ſenſe lately opened.) To prove this there are only theſe two things to be taken into conſideration and ſhewed:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That a large knowledge of God, of his Attributes, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, of his Counſels, and Decrees, and other things relating to him, and recorded in his word doth inveſt men and women with a capacity of ſuch an ample and large Communion with him which we ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That he that is filled with the Spirit cannot lightly (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly) but be thus enlarged in the knowledge of God, with the Attributes and Perfections of God.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> That a large knowledge of God, of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:95016:271"/>Perfections, Counſels, and Decrees muſt needs inveſt a perſon with a capacity of a large Communion with him may be proved thus: Only by the way, before we come to the proof, by the knowledge of God (in this place) we do not mean ſimply, a knowing [<hi>i. e.</hi> a having in a man's memory or underſtanding] that which is written in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, of God, of his Attributes, Counſels, Decrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or a being able to argue and diſcourſe of theſe in a rational way, and to draw Concluſions and Conſequences, though never ſo clearly, directly, and ſubſtantially from them; it is not ſuch a knowledge as this that will qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie men for that full and large Communion with God. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe a man may have ſuch a knowledge of God, his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and Attributes, and yet believe little or nothing at all of the truth of theſe things which in ſuch a ſenſe he knoweth. As <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſpeaking of young men, in reference to the excellent Principles of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and Virtue, of Temperance, Sobriety, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſaith, that young men are wont to ſpeak of theſe things, to utter them among themſelves, but they do not believe them: In like manner, many who are real Atheiſts in heart and ſoul may diſcourſe largely that there is a God; they may inſiſt upon all thoſe Arguments and Reaſons that have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by learned men for the proof hereof; yea, they may urge them with a great deal of ſtreſs and weight; yet it is not neceſſary to ſuppoſe but that they may be in doubt whether they be true or no. <hi>The Fool</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God;</hi> Many may ſay this in their hearts, while they are zealouſly and with a great deal of heat arguing that there is a God. It is recorded of one of the <hi>Popes,</hi> that in conference with one of his <hi>Cardinals,</hi> about their great Revenues and Wealth they had gotten, he ſpake thus unto him, <hi>Quantum nobis profuit haec Chriſti fabula?</hi> What a world of Wealth hath this Story or Fable of Chriſt brought in unto us? Now this Pope, and ſo many others may be devout in preſſing and urging of the Goſpel, and many things contained in it, and yet all this while have no manner of belief that there is any truth, or any reality in the Goſpel, or in the things that are delivered there. Many men have written very learned Commentaries upon many Books of Scripture; yet it is not neceſſary to be ſuppoſed that they believe the truth of theſe things upon which they thus write and make Expoſitions: Men may do the like upon any fabulous Books of the Apocrypha, as of <hi>Bell and the Dragon;</hi> they may draw from thence many good Concluſions and Doctrines, and yet not believe that there was ſuch a thing. I heard, not many years ſince, this paſſage of a Preacher in <hi>England,</hi> that coming to the houſe of another Miniſter (of his acquaintance) he was entreated to Preach for him on the Lord's day; he conſented, and performed the Service very gravely, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially; the ſubject matter of his Sermon was to prove the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the dead, he inſiſted upon and preſſed ſeveral weighty Reaſons
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:95016:272"/>and Arguments to prove it: Having ended his Sermon, the Miniſter, for whom he Preached being preſent, gave him many thanks for his Sermon; adding ſome words teſtifying his ſpecial approbation of it: Why (replied he that Preached) do you believe what I ſaid (meaning, concerning the Reſurrection?) Believe it (ſaid the other) what elſe? (Being ſomewhat ſtartled at ſuch a Queſtion.) Truly (ſaid that Preacher) for my part I do not. Therefore to be able to plead learnedly, and with acuteneſs of Wit, or ſolidity of Underſtanding for any Truth, or Subject, doth not neceſſarily argue or prove that a man knows the truth or certainty of the being of that which he pleadeth for at ſuch a rate. Poſſibly men may be able to bring forth ſuch Arguments which may be able to carry all other mens judgments before them, and yet they themſelves may be empty all this while of the belief of that, whatſoever it is they do aſſert and prove. The Scriptures themſelves ſeem to hold forth a difference between knowing a thing, and the believing of it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.38. <hi>But if I do</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Jews) <hi>the works of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> [meaning, the works that his Father had appointed him to do, and ſuch which are proper for him only to do] <hi>though ye believe not me</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> though you do not as yet think me a perſon worthy of credit or belief] <hi>yet believe the works</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> believe that which the works teſtifie of me] <hi>that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him; i. e.</hi> meaning, that ye may have Arguments and Grounds, not only which are ſufficient to perſwade and convince you of my Divinity; and upon which you may argue that I am the ſame dialectically, or with probability; but by which alſo you may be actually and <hi>de facto</hi> perſwaded of the truth and certainty hereof, ſo as to believe it; that you may know, and not only ſo, but that you may believe; that you may not only have Arguments and Reaſons to be able to diſcourſe of it, but that your knowledge may be rich and full of ſatisfaction in your own ſouls. And ſo in that heavenly Prayer of his, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8. a little before his death, ſpeaking of his Diſciples, <hi>For I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me.</hi> Our Saviour ſeems to make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, their knowledge, and their belief of him. <hi>They have known,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> meaning, they have upon ſufficient and true grounds known, <hi>i. e.</hi> apprehended and conceived <hi>that I came from thee;</hi> yea, (ſaith he) they have done ſomewhat more than this, <hi>they have believed that thou haſt ſent me;</hi> they have yielded up their hearts, ſouls, and conſciences to the convincing power of theſe words which thou gaveſt me to ſpeak unto them, and have according fully believed that thou haſt ſent me. So then that knowledge of God, of his Attributes, and Counſels, which we affirm to be requiſite to put you into a condition or capacity of an ample and large Communion with God, muſt be a knowledge,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:95016:272"/>not ſimply of thoſe things which are written in the Scriptures concerning God, but a knowledge of the reality, truth, and certainty of them; <hi>i. e.</hi> that God is really ſuch an One, ſuch a Nature, Eſſence, and Being in all points as the Scripture repreſenteth him to be, that he is full of Mercy, and full of Goodnrſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this is that kind of knowledge of which we do affirm, that when it is extenſive, and any whit large, it giveth a capacity of the Communion we ſpeak of. Again,</p>
               <p>Secondly, This was ſignified unto you, that that knowledge of God, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>21</label> of his Nature and Counſels, which will advance you to an ample or rich Communion with him, muſt be ſomewhat comprehenſive, and include a very conſiderable number of thoſe things concerning God, his Excellencies and Perfections, his Counſels and Decrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are declared and imparted unto the World by the Holy Ghoſt in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. They muſt be men in Underſtanding, and not Children, that ſhall be the Sons and Daughters of this high Prerogative we ſpeak of; yea, they muſt be able, not only to apprehend and conceive aright of the Mind of God in the Scriptures, ſo far as the words in their Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and next-hand ſenſe will carry them; but they muſt be expert (to ſome good degree at leaſt) in the Logical ſenſe of ſuch Scriptures alſo. My meaning is, they muſt be able to build, workman-like, upon the Scriptures; they muſt be able to find out the Will of God, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and likewiſe to go along with many Principles and Grounds which the Holy Ghoſt hath laid down here, and be able to draw infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences from them, and to follow their guidance, as far as they will lead them, into many particulars concerning God. This is the nature of Principles, and general Grounds. As there was a Wheel within a Wheel, in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion, ſo there may be many Conſiderations, many Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions concerning God that may be wound up in one Expreſſion, or one direct Saying in Scripture. For there are very many things requiſite to be known and underſtood concerning God, for the inveſting men and women with that capacity we ſpeak of, of enjoying a large Communion with God, which are not <hi>literâ tenus,</hi> or in ſo many words expreſſed in the Scriptures; and yet they may be plainly enough delivered and held forth here. For that may be truly and properly enough ſaid to be plainly taught and delivered, which with competent diligence, ſtudy, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation may be gathered from thoſe things which are plainly and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught and delivered. As <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 8.9. ſpeaketh concerning Inſtructions, end Precepts of Wiſdem (as the former Tranſlation reads the place) <hi>They are all plain to him that will underſtand, i. e.</hi> whoſe heart is ſet within him to underſtand them, who is not negligent and looſe minded to ſuch things, but is willing to enquire and find out the mind of God (as <hi>Lavater</hi> well expoundeth the place;) ſo may it be ſaid of thoſe things concerning God which are neceſſary to be known and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:95016:273"/>in order to that end and purpoſe we ſpeak of. And that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> is true, <hi>That the diligent hand maketh rich,</hi> Prov. 10.4. as well in Spirituals as Temporals. Now all theſe things of God, which being known put a man into a capacity of a large Communion with God, are not upon any ſuch terms laid down in the Scriptures, that if we ſhall but ſpare any ſmall time or labour, we may be as fully ſatisfied in them as if we had ſeen them face to face. It is no where ſaid in the Scripture, in ſo many words, that God, in theſe operations and workings upon the hearts and ſouls of men by his Word and Spirit, by which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to work Faith and Converſion, is reſiſtible; reſiſtible, I mean, in ſuch a ſenſe which imports a poſſibility in men, ſo wrought upon, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be actually converted or brought to believe, theſe operations of God notwithſtanding: This (I ſay) is not in theſe words, nor any other Grammatically equipollent to them, to be found in the Scriptures; yet it is plainly enough taught and delivered there, and this in ſeveral places, from whence it may be duly and clearly collected, as we have heretofore made apparent unto you. So again, that Chriſt died for me, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar for the Attonement of my ſin; or that God intended that Chriſt ſhould die for me; ſuch Poſitions as theſe, though they are no where in ſo many words delivered, yet they are delivered plainly enough in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and to much ſatisfaction; ſo that every man may with a little conſideration ſee them. Thus then you ſee what manner of knowledge of God, and of his Attributes, and Counſels it is, as well for the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as for the Extent, Compaſs, or Degree which is required to qualifie men and women for this large Communion with God; for the nature and quality of it, it muſt be a knowledge accompanied with a through belief of God and his Attributes; for the extent or compaſs, a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which is ſomewhat comprehenſive, both concerning God, his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Counſels, and Decrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now that ſuch a knowledge of God as this muſt needs prepare and make men capable of a large Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, is evident upon this conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> Communion cannot well extend further than there is a mutual knowledge of the one and of the other: How can two walk together unleſs there be ſome agreement in Principles? It was the Saying of <hi>Achiſh</hi> King of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines,</hi> 1 Sam. 21.15. <hi>Have I any need of mad men?</hi> When his Servant brought <hi>David</hi> before him; his meaning was, that he could not tell well what to do with him, or how to ſpeak to him, or what to imploy him about. And <hi>Solomon, Eccl.</hi> 5.4. ſpeaking to the ſame purpoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, ſaith, <hi>That he hath no delight in Fools.</hi> Men that have no knowledge of God, nor of his Attributes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are like unto ſtocks and ſtones; they are not at all capable of that Communion which we now ſpeak of; So likewiſe men and women who have but a ſcant know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, it may be ten parts of twelve dark, and but two light, ſo far as they are ignorant, their Communion with God will be obſtructed,
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:95016:273"/>and hindred; and conſequently, their Communion with God (if any at all) will be very narrow and contracted.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe we ſhall not need to ſpend time in proving, <label type="milestone">

Where the Spirit abideth with ſuch a fulneſs of his Preſence, he will enlighten, and open the darkneſs of the hearts of men, and will ſcatter that ignorance which otherwiſe is likely to darken them. Therefore we ſhall paſs by that, enough having been argued already; only a word or two to open unto you the rich and glorious accommodation, which the capacity of ſuch a free and large Communion with God, as we have inſiſted on, muſt needs be conceived to be unto thoſe that are inveſted with it, or made partakers of it: although the truth is, that the tranſcendent worth and excellency of the Priviledge we ſpeak of is near enough at hand to be apprehended and underſtood by all men without the help of any diſcourſe. For ſhall not the joy which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> dignifieth with thoſe two high Titles, Unſpeakable, and Glorious; ſhall not this attend a free and large Communion with God? It is mentioned by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as one of the richeſt ſtrains of felicity that the Elect Angels are partakers of, that they ſtand before their heavenly Father, and behold his face continually, <hi>i. e.</hi> they ſtand before him like unto Princes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted, unappaled; they have a free and large Communion with God: But that fleſh and bloud, the poor Children of men, ſhould arrive unto ſuch a ſtate and condition, as to have part and fellowſhip with them in this their happineſs and felicity, is certainly a tranſcendent priviledge unto them. It was a Reply that an old <hi>Philoſopher</hi> made to a Tyrant (a great Prince) who asked him what good he had gotten by the ſtudy of Philoſophy? Why (ſaith he) I have gotten this, that I can talk with the greateſt Tyrant in the World without being afraid of him. Now if this be a deſirable thing, that a man can look the greateſt and proudeſt man in the face without being diſmayed or afraid: What is it for a poor Creature, cloathed with fleſh and bloud, to be able to ſtand with an untroubled and undaunted ſpirit before the great and mighty God of Heaven and Earth, to come freely and boldly into his Preſence? So again, to be able to ſtand and contemplate the ineſtimable and incomprehenſible Majeſty of the great God of Heaven and Earth; to be able (I ſay) to bear the weight of this Majeſty and Glory without any trouble or burthen to the mind or ſpirit of a man, how great and how rich a glory muſt this needs be? It was the Saying of another <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,</hi> who was greatly taken with that Creature the <hi>Sun;</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that if he might be permitted to ſtand near the Sun, were it but for one day, ſo as that he might but underſtand what nature the Sun
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:95016:274"/>was of, he would be content to die at Evening (ſo much did he prize the knowledge and contemplation of this glorious Creature.) We read of a whole Sect of <hi>Philoſophers</hi>

                  </gap> would fix their eye upon the <hi>Sun</hi> when it appeared, and ſo ſtand looking upon it, and never give over looking till it went down out of their ſight. My Brethen, all created things are but ſlight reſemblances and ſhadows: What is the glory of them all if we ſhall but compare them with the glorious love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and ſplendour that is in God? What is the beauty of the Sun in compariſon of him and his beauty? <hi>&amp;c. We all</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.) <hi>as in a glaſs behold the glory of the Lord.</hi> The Angels do not ſee nor behold any other glory, but that which is preſented unto us in the glaſs of the Goſpel, they indeed ſee it more clearly, even face to face, we more darkly; and yet notwithſtanding that Glaſs of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, wherein we behold the glory of the Lord, is ſo clear and tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that there is little difference between beholding his glory face to face, and the beholding of it there; every Lineament of his face being here repreſented to the eyes of our minds or underſtandings, ſo that we can ſuſtain little loſs hereby. So that if men and women would but draw near unto this Glaſs wherein the Face of Jeſus Chriſt is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, or to be ſeen, they might behold any thing that the Angels in heaven do, and live in the ſame contemplation with them. For here is the Power, and here is the Glory, and here is every thing in this Glaſs: This doth contain the whole extent of the Face of Chriſt (if I may ſo ſpeak.) It holds out all the perfections of him whoſe face it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth. By the way, As men are known by their faces, ſo all which God is known by, is called the face of God: As the Mercy of God, the Power of God, and the Goodneſs of God, they all make the Face of God. Now then, to be able to bear the weight of all this bleſſedneſs and glory, without loſing the uſe of a mans underſtanding, without being confounded, or troubled in his Intellectuals, without being like a dead man, cannot but be an exceeding great Priviledge. I beſeech you conſider what other exerciſe or engagement of your ſelves, or of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble powers of your Souls can you imagine ſhould produce any thing of a like filling and ſatisfying nature? <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 27.4.) <hi>that will I ſeek after: that I may dwell in the Houſe of the Lord all the daies of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his holy Temple.</hi> He thought this not only a thing deſirable, but he was reſolved to ſeek after it; he would firſt commend this his deſire unto the Lord, and then ſeek after it; he would try this way, and that, and any way that would do. This one thing which he had ſingled out amongſt all his other requeſts, was, that he might dwell in the Houſe of the Lord all the daies of his life to behold the beauty of the Lord. My Brethren, we generally are but dull Spectators of his glory, it may be many of us are more taken with other objects
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:95016:274"/>which ſeem to be of a more deſirable import unto us; but if we did but ſee with <hi>David's</hi> eyes, if we had judgment within us to eſtimate beauty indeed; this would be our One thing, the thing which we would chiefly deſire, to behold the beauty of the Lord; eſpecially, inaſmuch as we have liberty to behold it without being diſmayed. So again, that was another thing in our large and free Communion with God, to pray unto God with aſſurance that we ſhall be heard. They that are large in the knowledge of God, that underſtand much of his Will; they that have a large Communion with God in Prayer, they can pray with aſſurance that they ſhall be accepted, and that their requeſt ſhall be granted unto them. Now then, if we ſhall weigh this Royal Priviledge alſo in the balance of the Sanctuary, we ſhall find it to weigh down Silver and Gold; all theſe things will be but as the Duſt in the Balance in compariſon of it. To call upon the Majeſty of the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and to have an opportunity to make your requeſt unto him for all things you deſire; not only all that at preſent you deſire, but all things that can come into your hearts to deſire, and that you may upon occaſion or emergency from day to day deſire of him, and to be ſupplied accordingly by the hand of your Angel, I mean, by your Prayer: If this great Priviledge be but conſidered, and laid to heart, and meaſured by the meaſure of God, it will be found to amount to as conſiderable a matter as any that we have preſented you with.</p>
               <p>And thus we have done with the third particular, which we formerly ſignified unto you, muſt needs, in conjunction with the other three, render the Life and Eſtate of a man in this World deſirable in the higheſt; as deſirable (I mean) as this World will afford deſirableneſs of condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the Sons and Daughters of men.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> The Eighth Motive further opened in the fourth particular, a being filled with the Spirit doth intereſt men with a rich and large Intereſt in God. How this Intereſt doth ariſe by being filled with the Spirit of God. Reaſons why ſo little is done by Prayer now, in compariſon of what was done in the Primitive times. Without being filled with the Spirit none of the great bleſſings, formerly mentioned (and which render a mans Condition ſo deſirable in this World) are to be obtained. The Reaſons whence it comes to paſs: And the equitableneſs of God's proceeding with men therein. The difference between a fearleſs and dreadleſs frame of ſpirit, that is counterfeit, and that which is raiſed upon good Grounds. A being filled with the Spirit is the only way to cauſe the Crown of glory to flouriſh on the head of a man; And that with a greater meaſure of glory in the World which is to come.</head>
               <p>THe Fourth (and laſt) particular was this, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> They that are filled with the Spirit muſt needs have a rich and large intereſt with God, in reſpect of prevailing with him by Prayer, and carrying matters of greateſt and higheſt importance at the Throne of Grace.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, to ſhew and prove this, That Perſons <hi>filled with the Spirit of God</hi> cannot but be great in their intereſt with God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That ſuch a greatneſs of Intereſt in God, eſpecially being accompanied with the other three Priviledges, formerly opened and aſſerted, cannot but compleat the felicity and deſirableneſs of the life of a man or woman in this World.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Reaſon why they, who are filled with the Spirit, muſt needs be great in the ſight of God, and carry things with an high hand at the Throne of Grace, is (that which heretofore we have proved at large) <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe ſuch perſons are men after <hi>Gods own heart</hi> (the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which God himſelf gave of <hi>David</hi>) <hi>i. e.</hi> (as himſelf explaineth the ſaid Character) perſons that will fulfill <hi>all his pleaſure</hi> (meaning, as concerning themſelves, or ſo far as it concerns them, or as they are in a capacity to fulfil it;) they will make the moſt that can be made by men in their Cloaths (as we uſe to ſay) of the Intereſt of God and of Jeſus Chriſt in the World. This ſame activeneſs and ſpiritfulneſs in
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:95016:275"/>the ſervice of God is one of the moſt natural, conſtant, and viſible fruits and effects of any man or womans being filled with the Spirit of God. For when the ſoul or inward part of a man is filled with the Spirit it cannot contain it ſelf; and the iſſuings and breathings of it out are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but excellent and high actings for God; a fruitfulneſs of life and converſation. This is as natural and genuine fruit, of mens being filled with the Spirit, as the Fig is the natural fruit of the Fig-tree, and the Grape the natural fruit of the Vine. For the nature of the Spirit of God is to glorifie God, that is, to be ſerviceable unto his ends, purpoſes, and deſires in the World. And therefore, according to that true Rule in Philoſophy, every Agent ſeeketh to aſſimilate his Patient unto himſelf: So the Spirit of God, where he is in his fulneſs, he maketh men lively and vigorous, he putteth it into them, and draweth them on unto waies of Excellency, and giveth them no reſt, but is ſtill exciting of them unto the ſerving of God. But this Point we have argued formerly, and evinced the truth of the thing from the Scriptures above all contradictions: That which we have now to do, is to ſhew and prove, that thoſe who are diligent, and faithful, and zealous obſervers of the Precepts of God, and are free in laying out them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the account of his intereſt and glory, are Perſons that have his ear (as we uſe to ſay) and who for the asking may obtain any thing with reaſon and with righteouſneſs at his hands; and the Perſons we now ſpeak of are not apt or wont to ask any thing upon other terms. But that which we now deliver is abundantly delivered by God himſelf unto you in the Scriptures; namely, that Perſons who are full of action for God have large quarter at the Throne of Grace, and carry matters of high import with God, and that with an high hand.</p>
               <p>We have ſeveral paſſages in Scriptures to conſult with, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.22. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>And whatſoever we ask, we receive of him,</hi> &amp;c. It is put in the Preſent Tenſe, as it is very uſual, after the manner of Prophetical Dialect, to ſpeak of things that be Future in the Preſent Tenſe, or as being preſent by reaſon of the truth and certainty of the things that are ſpoken. So here, <hi>Whatſoever we ask we receive, i. e.</hi> are as certain that we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as if we had it already; whatſoever we ask we receive of him, becauſe <hi>we keep his Commandments.</hi> Here is the ground-work, becauſe they obſerved them. The word is very emphatical, ſignifying both the inward reſpect that men have of them in their minds, memories, and conſciences, and alſo the external action ariſing out of this; not only becauſe we keep his Commandments; but likewiſe, becauſe <hi>we do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi> He implies, that men may keep the Commandments of God, and yet may not do the things that are pleaſing in his ſight; For there is (as we have had occaſion hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to diſtinguiſh) a difference between the keeping of the Letter of the Precepts or Commands of God, and the carrying on of thoſe
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:95016:276"/>Commands to ſuch an obſervance of them, which include many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars (which indeed commends our obedience unto God) yet are not in the Letter, or ſurface of the Command. Now Prayer, though it ſhould be with the greateſt earneſtneſs performed, or with the greateſt Faith and Confidence, yet if it be not the Prayer of a righteous man, the Promiſe of prevailing, much would not belong to it: So here, to ask a thing according to the Will of God doth not only include a praying righteouſly in reſpect of the matter, and alſo in the manner, but alſo ſuch Conditions and Qualifications which according to the Will of God ought to be found in thoſe that ſhould pray; amongſt which Qualifications this is one, that they be men and women ready and free to do ſuch things which are pleaſing to God; not ſimply and barely to do his Commands, but to do thoſe things which are pleaſing unto him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.22. <hi>All things whatſoever ye ſhall ask in Prayer, believing, ye ſhall receive.</hi> This word, believing, is very comprehenſive, and it doth include in it all things that are requiſite and neceſſary for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of this Prayer unto this poſture; that is, unto a receiving poſture. Now certain it is, no man can have that confidence; which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, towards God, or that believing to receive whatſoever he ſhall ask in Prayer, which our Saviour ſpeaks of, but only he who is conſcious to himſelf of his faithfulneſs to God, and of his integrity and uprightneſs in his waies. For, my Brethren, if the Conſciences of men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhall reprove them of any looſeneſs, or lightneſs of ſpirit; or that they have ſerved God by halves; that they have been off and on with him in their practice, and negligent in making uſe of ſuch advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and opportunities for the glorifying of his name, which he hath put into their hands; this will be like a Bridle in the Lips of mens Faith, there will be fears, and jealouſies, and inward doubtings within them: Whereas if our hearts ſhall bear a rich Teſtimony unto us (which they will never do unleſs we ſhall be under ſuch a frame of ſpirit to do the things that are pleaſing in his ſight) that we have walked before him in all uprightneſs, then will our Faith and Confidence be ſteady, and we may pray with the greateſt aſſurance that we ſhall receive whatſoever we ask of God. And ſo again, <hi>Ask and it ſhall be given you, ſeek and ye ſhall find, knock and it ſhall be opened unto you,</hi> Mat. 7.7. I mention this paſſage of Scripture to ſhew, that where there is a promiſe made of being heard and accepted with God (and there is the ſame Notion in the other Scripture even now mentioned and argued) there is ſtill ſomething required of men to render them meet to be accepted of him: As here God requires of ſuch as are but weak in Faith, and of an ordinary growth in holineſs, and in the love and favour of God, that they be frequent and conſtant in their importuning of him before he will give them the things they deſire of him: Whereas thoſe who are zealous for God have a more quick and ready audience. Chriſtians of a lower
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:95016:276"/>form and ordinary growth and ſtature (as I ſaid even now) may be heard, but they muſt put more ſtrength to their Prayers, and wait long untill they have their anſwer from God, which is ſignified in theſe words, <hi>Seek and ye ſhall find;</hi> which ſhews, that if perſons have not that excellent qualification in the ſight of God to commend them in his love and favour, they muſt work ſo much the harder, and wait ſo much the longer upon God. <hi>Shall he not avenge his Elect, who cry day and night unto him?</hi> Luke 18.7. But <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> if they ſhall but ſtand before him, the firſt appearance of them will do it. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry. The righteous cry, and the Lord heareth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.15, 17. The word open is not in the Original, but the meaning is, that the ear of God is propenſe, and in a leaning kind of poſture towards the cries of the Righteous; the word may here be taken Emphatically, as many times in Scripture it is, for ſome worthy, choice, and excellent ſtrain of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Thoſe who are worthy and righteous indeed, the ear of God (I ſay) is propenſe, and leans, and hangs towards them and their Prayers; according to that of <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Let me hear thy voice, for ſweet is thy voice.</hi> There is a kind of naturalneſs, and pleaſantneſs between the ear of God and the Prayers, and Petitions, and cries of ſuch a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.7. <hi>If ye abide in me, and my word abide in you, ask what you will and it ſhall be done unto you.</hi> There is a double condition mentioned, and expected to be in perſons that deſire to receive, and to have every thing done unto them, and for them at the hand of God. Firſt, Their abiding in his Word, that they do not decline it, and turn their backs upon it, nor cut themſelves off from him, or hearing him further. And ſecondly, <hi>If my word abide in you;</hi> if you be obſervant of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, and improve the times and ſeaſons vouchſafed unto you, and will provide and take care that my words abide in you, then (ſaith he) your Prayer will be the great prevailer at the Throne of Grace; God my Father will not deny you any thing that you ſhall ask of him. For I ſuppoſe the meaning of theſe words, <hi>and my Word abide in you,</hi> to be this, that perſons ſhould be ſolicitous about the words of Chriſt, and matters of duty contained in them, and that they ſhould not have them to ſeek, but make ſpecial treaſure of them, and have them alwaies ready at hand, that they may be directed, and put upon their duty and ſervice by the means of them. It is the common caſe of Chriſtians; they would do the things which the Word of Chriſt requires of them if this Word of his were preſent in their thoughts and minds; but they miſcarry at many a turn, and fall foul upon many things, contrary to their duty, only becauſe the Word by which they ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="526" facs="tcp:95016:277"/>it alſo; but if they do underſtand it they hide it not its their hearts (for they that hide we know can find:) they have not that high eſteem of it which they ought, for then it would abide with them, and not be to ſeek upon ſuch occaſions, and at ſuch times when they ſhould be directed by it to do and perform ſuch and ſuch ſervices acceptable unto God; and then for want of its preſence with them there is a breach in their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and conſequently in their peace and comforts; and they are often thrown upon diſadvantages when they come to the Throne of Grace. Another place like unto this is, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.26, 27. <hi>At that day ye ſhall ask in my name, and I ſay not unto you that I will pray the Father for you: For the Father himſelf loveth you,</hi> &amp;c. The Father loveth you, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knows the love you have unto me, which you have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by believing in me; and therefore I ſhall have no need particularly to intercede for you. His deſire was to ground them in the greateſt confidence of the love of God himſelf, or the Father unto them; and therefore he ſaith, inaſmuch as you have loved me, and declared your affection in believing that I came forth from God; therefore, ſaith he, the Father himſelf loveth you, and is of himſelf exceeding propenſe to hear your Prayers. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.13. <hi>And whatſoever ye ſhall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</hi> The meaning of that clauſe, <hi>that the Father may be glorified in the Son,</hi> which ſteers the ſenſe of the whole Verſe, doth import this; that the things which ye ſhall ask, in order to the glorifying of the Father, and that upon the account of me, or in my name, ſuch Requeſts and Petitions ſhall ſurely be granted, and I will ſtand by you in them, and they ſhall be done unto you.</p>
               <p>Beſides we find that the Saints of old, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> they that were excellent in their waies made account, that if they were in any ſtraight or danger, or their people ſtood in need of any ſpecial and extraordinary delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and protection, that it was but their praying to God, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding for it, and they made as due account of receiving of it in ſuch a caſe as the Husbandman which ſoweth his Seed doth to reap the Harveſt in due time, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11. When <hi>Joſhuah</hi> was fighting with <hi>Amaleck</hi> in the Valley, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Text ſaith, That all the while that the hands of <hi>Moſes</hi> were lifted up <hi>Iſrael</hi> prevailed, but being weary, when they hung down, <hi>Amaleck</hi> prevailed; and therefore they found a way (<hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur</hi>) to ſupport them, and ſo <hi>Amaleck</hi> was overthrown. Now this lifting up and falling down of <hi>Moſes</hi> hands in Prayer was ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative; for we cannot ſuppoſe but that <hi>Moſes</hi> did pray as effectually when his hands hung down as when they were lifted up. And therefore I ſuppoſe this is taught and ſignified unto us by the lifting up of <hi>Moſes</hi> hands (which was nothing but a kind of Sacramental Action) that God's acceptation of Prayer doth not ariſe from any worth or excellence that is inherent either in the Perſon, or in the Prayer (if ſtrictly
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:95016:277"/>conſidered) but from the Ordinance of God in the caſe, he having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed this as a means by which he will convey his favours unto men. And this is the nature of Sacraments, and of all Sacramental Efficients; the benefit, and comforts, and the like, that any of us do at any time receive by them, do not proceed from any thing that we receive in the Elements, or in the nature of the Action that is done by us, or by any other that have any part in the Action in the Sacrament beſides our ſelves. I ſay, the fruit of the Sacrament doth not iſſue from any of theſe, and yet without theſe we ſhould not come at it; but the reaſon of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Sacraments is the Ordinance of God, who hath joyned faſt theſe means to ſuch and ſuch ends: Hence it is, that there is efficacy in any kind, or to any degree. As in the healing of <hi>Naaman's</hi> Leproſie, <hi>Go and waſh in Jordan ſeven time,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.10. This was a Sacrament which he was to perform in order to his healing; but the healing of the Leproſie did not proceed from the water, nor from the Action of Waſhing, but from the Ordinance and appointment of God, who had determined that the man ſhould be healed and cleanſed of his Leproſie by ſubmitting to his pleaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> In going to <hi>Jordan,</hi> and waſhing ſeven times. So when the blowing of the Rams Horns, and compaſſing the City of <hi>Jericho</hi> by the Prieſts became effectual to the bringing down the Walls thereof, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.20. This Efficacy was not to be found in the Rams Horns, nor in the Prieſts, nor in the compaſſing of the City ſeven times, nor in the qualifications of the Prieſts; but it was to be ſought and found out in the good pleaſure of God that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and purpoſed it. Let but men obey him in ſuch and ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Obſervations, and matters of light conſequence to the eye of ordinary underſtanding, and they ſhall ſee the effects of it are, what he by his great and out-ſtretched Arm will do for them: In like manner, the reaſon why Prayer is ſo potent, and of that mighty vigour, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency with God, is, becauſe there is much of a Sacramental nature in it. For if we do but conſider the righteouſneſs that is to be found in the Creature, even in ſuch kind of perſons that are active in the higheſt for God, and are zealous and true hearted for his cauſe and glory; the Prayers (I ſay) that ſhall from time to time be preſented unto God by theſe men have nothing in them which in a ſtrict ſenſe and rigid kind of eſtimate will bear any proportion, in reſpect of the worthineſs that is in the favours and vouchſafements which they receive from God by this means; ſo that ſetting aſide his Promiſe in the caſe there is no ſtrict Rule of Righteouſneſs that obligeth him hereunto; and yet notwithſtanding there is a natural kind of equity that God ſhould anſwer them: Firſt, If we conſider the nature of righteouſneſs, eſpecially when it is raiſed to any excellent degree in the hearts and ſouls of men, and when it utters it ſelf accordingly. And then ſecondly, Conſidering the nature of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Supplications made unto God. And then thirdly, Taking into
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:95016:278"/>conſideration the graciouſneſs, and bountifulneſs, and goodneſs of God, which are all eſſential unto him; then, I ſay, it is an equitable thing, and it is very meet, and every way well becoming the great God, that he ſhould do this; that he ſhould have reſpect to ſuch perſons as theſe, that ſerve him with all their might and with all their ſtrength; that he ſhould indulge them with ſome Eminent and Royal Priviledge above the common and ordinary ſort of thoſe that call upon him but only in an ordinary manner. And another Reaſon may be, why God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve choice favours and priviledges for men that are choice in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and that have larger hearts towards him than others have, is, that he may hereby lay an engagement upon the reſt of the Children of men, eſpecially his own Children, that they proceed and be in a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poſture, and that they ſhould give their heart no reſt nor peace untill they come up to the Line of their Elder Brethren, whom they ſhall ſee in ſuch high grace and favour with God. For ſhould he vouchſafe an equality of grace and favour with himſelf unto perſons that are but low and broken in their obedience, and that are apt from time to time to ſin againſt him, and to pull down with one hand what they build up with the other: If God (I ſay) ſhould make theſe equal with thoſe that are moſt worthy in their way, he would not have an Argument wherewith to deal with the hearts and conſciences of men; for then there would be ſome who would never ſtrive to be excellent, or to be above others, if they that be beneath in the Valley ſhould have the light of the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God ſhine as bright upon them as it doth upon thoſe that are at the top of the Mount, and that have laboured and took a great deal of pains to get up thither. But now it is marvellous agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and excellency of his holineſs to draw and wind up his Creatures, and to be training of them up by waies which are ſutable and kindly for them to be dealt withal, and ſtill to be ſtirring and working up their hearts, minds, and ſpirits unto things that are moſt excellent, and that are moſt like himſelf. So that we ſee this prevalency of Prayer with God is in part Sacramental and not meerly natural and moral; that there is equity and reaſon in it that God ſhould do thus and thus by perſons, by giving a preeminence unto them above their Neighbours; and yet notwithſtanding, if we ſpeak in a way of ſtrictneſs and rigour of Juſtice, there is nothing in the righteouſnes of the perſons, nor in the Prayers of theſe that can upon any ſuch terms engage God and prevail with him.</p>
               <p>But we were not long ſince ſaying, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> that the Saints of God of old, thoſe that were his Worthies, made account that if they were in any danger, and ſtood in any need of more than ordinary deliverance, if they had any manner of Requeſts whereby to make Friends, or to do any great things for their People, for their Nation, or Country, their way was ready before them; they knew that they had ſuch an Angel
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:95016:278"/>as Prayer is, and knowing withall the intereſt which they had in God, they made account that it was but to diſpatch their Angel of Prayer into his preſence and their deſire would ſoon be granted. See ſuch a thing in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 18.3. <hi>I will call on the Lord, who is worthy to be praiſed, ſo ſhall I be ſaved from mine Enemies;</hi> I will pray (ſaith he) and then I do expect (as it were of courſe) Salvation and deliverance from God. And ſo again, in <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>The ſorrows of hell compaſſed me about:</hi> And what did he in this caſe? When he ſaw no way of eſcape, he diſpatches his Angel unto Heaven; and his Angel was ſent back with deliverance: <hi>he heard my voice out of his Temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears;</hi> And then what follows? What a tempeſt and ſtorm doth God preſently raiſe againſt his Enemies? <hi>Ver.</hi> 7, 8, &amp;c. <hi>Then the Earth ſhook and trembled, the foundations of the Hills moved, and were ſhaken,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo again, <hi>ver.</hi> 18.19. <hi>They prevented me in the day of my calamity: But the Lord was my ſtay, he delivered me, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in me.</hi> We know it is a thing uſual with men (and that which is but equal, and no mans reproach or ſhame) to be more kind, and more enclinable to help thoſe that are willing to ſerve them, thoſe that are reſpectful of them, and charge their minds and thoughts with their Affairs and Concernments: I ſay, it is but reaſonable, that a man who is thus reſpected by another ſhould ſhew and meaſure out reſpects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to him again: So God (it ſeems) uſes to deal with men in this caſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>The Lord rewarded me according to my righteouſneſs, according to the cleanneſs of my hands hath he recompenſed me; for I have kept the waies of the Lord, and not wickedly departed from my God.</hi> We ſee that it was not ſimply Prayer, or <hi>David's</hi> crying unto the Lord that brought this deliverance down from Heaven unto him with ſo high an hand; no, but it was his righteouſneſs, the cleanneſs of his hands, the keeping of himſelf clean in the ſight of God; this was that which gave power to his Prayer, and cauſed it to prevail at that high rate with him. And ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath heard my Supplication, and he will receive my Prayer;</hi> And what then? <hi>Let all mine Enemies be aſhamed and ſore vexed,</hi> &amp;c. As if he had ſaid, Let them look to it all mine Enemies; for I am reſolved that I will pray, and call upon God, and I know then what will fall to their portion, and therefore let them look for nothing, nor expect nothing but ruine and deſtruction when I ſhall do it. And in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.5, 6. It is ſaid there, concerning the two Witneſſes, <hi>That if any man would hurt them, fire proceeded out of their mouth, and devoured their Enemies; and if any man will hurt them be muſt in this manner be killed;</hi> As if he had ſaid, there is no way with them but one, if they attempt any thing cruelly and unmercifully againſt my Witneſſes, their fiery Prayers and Supplications, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of their mouths, will deſtroy them. And ſo he goes on, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Theſe have power to ſhut Heaven that it rain not in the day of their
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:95016:279"/>Propheſie, and have power over waters to turn them into bleud,</hi> &amp;c. Ye have heard that this Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> runneth much upon Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories and Types which it borrows from the Old Teſtament; but the plain meaning of theſe Expreſſions is only this; that thoſe that ſhould ſtand it out againſt Antichriſt, his Apoſtacies, and the Idolatrous do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in thoſe times, ſhould be able to do as great things, and to bring to paſs things of the like nature and conſideration in their kind, with thoſe great works in the daies of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and of <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.14. where God ſpeaks of <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> that if theſe men ſhould ſtand before him, yet they ſhould <hi>deliver but their own ſouls by their righteouſneſs.</hi> It is very likely that it was a received Principle amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that men like unto theſe could prevail for what they would with God, and God would not deny them any thing that they asked of him: For otherwiſe it was to no purpoſe to affect the people, and to take them off from expectation of any help from the mediation of them, or ſuch as they were, unleſs they had hoped for deliverance by the means of ſuch men. But now (ſaith he) it is true indeed, if theſe men, or any like unto them, ſhould ſtand up and intercede with me, they ſhould have ſomewhat more than other men, they ſhould prevail with me for themſelves: But as to the ſaving of the Nation, and the preventing of the Judgment which I am now fully reſolved to execute upon you, it is ſuch, of ſuch a nature and conſequence, that it is not fit for me to grant; neither indeed would theſe men ask any ſuch things at my hand, if they knew the ſtate of things between me and you, and how repugnant it is to thoſe Principles of Holineſs, Wiſdom, and Juſtice, by which I govern the World, and muſt govern it, if I govern it like my ſelf. So God likewiſe telleth <hi>Jeremiah, Neither lift up a cry for this people, for if they pray I will not hear them,</hi> Jer. 11.14. &amp; 14.11. &amp; 7.16. As if <hi>Jeremiah</hi> had had ſuch an opinion, that this people might have been brought off from that Judgment which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards them, and that God ſhould have ſuffered ſome kind of inconveniency to have denied him if he had prayed for them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent him, he plainly tells him, that he would not have him pray for them. As if God had ſaid, it is not at all out of my way to deny ſuch Petitions and Suits as they that are wicked and ſtubborn put up; but it would be otherwiſe with me, in caſe thou ſhouldſt pray, and I muſt go ſomewhat out of my way to deny thee, and therefore (ſaith he) do it not. Now this paſſage plainly ſhews, that ſuch perſons who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in righteouſneſs, and that are wont to lay out themſelves freely for God, he is wont to expreſs himſelf with an anſwerable freedom and bounty to them; and conſequently, to give them power at the Throne of Grace, and intereſt there. Thus then we ſee how, and upon what account Perſons filled with the Spirit of God muſt needs according to the Scriptures have a great intereſt in God, and carry
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:95016:279"/>a great ſtroke by their Prayers at the Throne of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they <hi>keep his Commandments, and do the things that are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is a matter of eaſie and ready apprehenſion to conceive of how rich a conſequence ſuch an high Priviledge as this we have mentioned, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> and found men and women filled with the Spirit to ſtand poſſeſſed of, muſt needs be to make the life of a man moſt deſirable in this World. We know for a man to have the Ear of a King, or a great Potentate of the Earth, ſo as to be able to procure his Arm to be ſtretched forth on his behalf, as oft as he ſhould reaſonably deſire it, is eſteemed (and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without cauſe) to be a great piece of wordly Felicity. But alas! What is ſuch an intereſt in the greateſt or mightieſt King or Prince under the Heavens, being compared with that intereſt which ſuch a perſon, as we have ſpoken of, hath in God? The gleanings of him that hath the Ear of the Great God of all the Earth open to his Prayer, are better than the Vintage of him that hath the Ear of the greateſt Monarch in the World open unto him. They who have the Ear of God open, upon ſuch terms as perſons filled with the Spirit have it, are in a capacity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, not only to provide, or procure for themſelves, as oft as they deſire all accommodations regularly neceſſary, to render their lives full of peace, comfort, and contentment; but likewiſe to Umpire and order the great Affairs of the World round about them; yea, and to give Laws unto Nations, and to rule them with a Rod of Iron. For ſuch perſons as we now ſpeak of are a firſt fruits of that World to come, which in Scriptures is called the <hi>new Heavens,</hi> and the <hi>new Earth,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Saints;</hi> and is much diſcourſed amongſt us under the name of the <hi>Fifth Monarchy</hi> (a Name and Notion proper enough for it:) and have a firſt-fruit granted unto them by God of thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Priviledges, of that Intereſt of Power and Grandeur which ſhall be veſted in the great Body, or whole Community of the Saints in that day (of which we may have occaſion ere long to ſpeak more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.) So as this ſhall be the Priviledge and Prerogative of all the Saints in that day, that they ſhall rule the Nations, as it were, with a Rod of Iron, and break them in pieces like a Potters Veſſel; meaning, that the whole Earth ſhall be given unto them, as it is in <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 7.18.27. Even ſo ſhall the perſons, we ſpeak of, before the Dawning of that Day, before the New Heaven and the New Earth, taſte of the great happineſs and felicity of the Choſen of God in thoſe daies; and they ſhall Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and Rule, and carry and ſway the great Affairs of the World, as we have it in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 27. <hi>He that overcometh and keepeth my works un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end,</hi> that man that ſtandeth it out in my Cauſe, and fights it out unto death, <hi>to him will I give power over the Nations, and he ſhall rule with a Rod of Iron,</hi> &amp;c. meaning, that he ſhall have part in the great felicity of that day. You know that paſſage in <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.17. where it is
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:95016:280"/>ſaid, that <hi>Elijah,</hi> who was a man ſubject to the like paſſions, and the like infirmities with other men, I ſuppoſe he means not ſo much (if at all) ſinful infirmities, as corporal: he was a man ſubject to ſorrow, and ſickneſs, and death as well as we, or any of us are, and yet he did thus by Prayer; he prayed, and he ſhut the Heavens; and again he prayed, and he opened the Heavens, and provided rain for the Earth by his Prayer. Now I ſuppoſe the Apoſtle inſerts theſe words, <hi>A man ſubject to like paſſions as we are,</hi> to remove that great ſtumbling ſtone which might be in the minds and thoughts of ordinary Chriſtians that are weak and poor, that carry about with them a body of ſickneſs and death, and are deſpiſed in the World, and not regarded and ſet by, by the great men in the World. How then ſhould they expect that a God of that infinite Majeſty which he is, to whom they ſhould pray and make their requeſts ſhould regard them; Eſpecially in the gratifying of them upon any ſuch terms, that he ſhould do any great or excellent thing more than ordinary for them? Now, to ſuch the Holy Ghoſt here ſaith, do not be troubled, let no ſuch thought as this ariſe within you upon ſuch an occaſion; for I tell you, that <hi>Elijah</hi> was a man as weak as you, cloathed with the ſame fleſh, ſubject to ſickneſſes and pain, and to be contemned and ſlighted by men, as he was by <hi>Ahab</hi> and others; yet this did not at all obſtruct his intereſt with God; his Prayer was potent and powerful with him, for he did very great things, as you know, by his Prayer; he ſhut the Heaven, being highly offended with the wickedneſs of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and their Idolatry: He interceded (as it were) againſt them, and ſought to draw down Judgments upon them; indeed he ſought hereby to humble them, and to bring them to the ſight of their ſins (as it ſeems he did;) and accordingly, when he ſaw that they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and were reformed in their waies, he did by another Prayer turn the courſe of the Diſpleaſure of God another way, and drew down the love and favour of God out of Heaven upon them.</p>
               <p>And, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> my Brethren, doubtleſs the reaſon why the intereſt of Prayer is fallen ſo low, and ſunk, as it were, in the Chriſtian World, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of what it was in the Primitive times, in the daies of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and in the Ages next after them; the reaſon (I ſay) why ſo little is done in the World by means of Prayer, is, becauſe the Generation of thoſe who in the Primitive times were wont to be filled with the Spirit, and to be large hearted towards God, is in a manner extinct; and that heavenly vigour, which poſſeſſed the hearts and reins, and brake forth, and ſhewed it ſelf in the lives and waies of the Firſt and Second Ages of Primitive Chriſtians, was not lookt after in the Generations after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but inſtead thereof many of them ſuffered a Spirit of ignorance and blind zeal to enter into them, and to poſſeſs them, which under a pretenſe of beſtirring it ſelf, and acting for God and Jeſus Chriſt made
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:95016:280"/>wrack and havock of their intereſt in the World. And there is more than enough of this kind of ſpirit and vigour that is gotten into the the hearts and inward parts of many Profeſſors amongſt us; who, like to the Jews of old, have a great zeal for God, but not according to knowledge; yea, there is a great variety of ſeveral ſhapes and forms of this kind of zeal amongſt us. The <hi>Antinomian,</hi> he laies out himſelf effectually for the advancement of his Opinion and waies; and thinks he doth God and his Goſpel the only ſervice in the World. A ſecond ſort of Profeſſor; he is as a flame of fire, he is content to ſpend, and to be ſpent in the Service of his way, being full of confidence, that even whileſt he treads and tramples under foot the peace and comforts of the Children and dear Servants of Chriſt, yet he is the only Benefactor to his Throne and Kingdom amongſt men. A third Party, abominating the Zeal of the former, riſeth up early, and goeth to bed late, and eats the bread of much carefulneſs to mount upon the back of Secular Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and if he get but his foot faſt and ſure upon this ground, he makes account that by turning the edge of the Magiſtrates Sword againſt all that he conceipts to be Errors, Hereſies, Blaſphemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by riding over the heads of all thoſe whom he calls Sectaries he ſhall ſet God upon the Throne, and put an Iron Scepter into the hand of Jeſus Chriſt, wherewith to break all his Enemies in pieces like a Potters Veſſel; making full account that God will never have a Temple upon Earth unleſs it be of his building. The Seeker, whileſt he throws the Houſe of God out of the Windows (as we uſe to ſay) and makes an utter deſolation in the Courts thereof, caſting out all the Ordinances and Miniſtrations of it as Menſtruous and polluted Rags, and makes an headleſs, heartleſs, and confuſed meeting of a few, to ſpeak what any Spirit, one or other, ſhall prompt them withall; he conceipts (and this with confidence enough too) that he acts according to the heart of Jeſus Chriſt; and that perſons of all other forms and waies do rather great diſſervice to Jeſus Chriſt, and the truth than otherwiſe; and that he, and men of his inſpiration, are the only perſons that underſtand aright what makes for the lifting up of the Throne of Chriſt amongſt men. Yea, the Rantor himſelf, whoſe Principles and waies have no more Communion with the glory of God, or of Jeſus Chriſt, than Light hath with Darkneſs, or Chriſt himſelf with <hi>Belial,</hi> yet he, in his own conceipt, is the firſt-born amongſt the Friends of God and of Jeſus Chriſt: He alone it is that ſpreads abroad the ſweet ſavour of Jeſus Chriſt in the World, whileſt he pours out himſelf in all manner of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and ſentenceth men of other Principles and Practices as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers unto God, and to the Goſpel, and obſcurers and darkeners of the Grace of God, and the fulneſs of Redemption purchaſed by Jeſus Chriſt. Yea, there is another ſort, who is the laſt-born Son of <hi>Sathan</hi> (that I know amongſt us) he finds falſe fire in the Zeal of all the former,
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:95016:281"/>and therefore hath ſet up a new form or way for the worſhipping and ſerving of God; and though Sathan be more palpably viſible in it than in any of the former, yet he is confident that all other waies ought to caſt down their Crowns to the ground at the feet of it; yea, and that they ſhall be made to do it. Thus God hath many in the World that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend high in Friendſhip to him, and in Zeal for his glory, who yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed trouble and diſturbe the World: And many of them labour in the very ſire; and ſome of them do as little ſpare their fleſh, as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of <hi>Baal</hi> did, who cut themſelves with Knives and Lances; which they needed not to do in caſe they were real Friends indeed unto God, and worthy Imitators of the true Zeal and Chriſtian fervour of Spirit which uttered themſelves in the Primitive Chriſtians. So that as <hi>Solomon,</hi> obſerving the common pretenſes and profeſſions of men one to another, expreſſeth himſelf thus, <hi>Prov</hi> 20.6. <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt men will boaſt, every man of his own goodneſs; But who can find a faithful man?</hi> That is, a Friend indeed and indeed: So may God altogether as truly ſay, that there are many in the World, men of this way, and men of that way, men of a third, of a fourth, and of a fifth, who all boaſt of their goodneſs, who pretend love to me, and zeal for my glory; but I can hardly find a faithful man amongſt them; a man who naturally careth for the things of my glory. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks concerning <hi>Timothy,</hi> that did naturally mind his Affairs; it is one of the hardeſt things in the World to find men (eſpecially any publick Society of men) that do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally mind the things of Jeſus Chriſt. But the thing I was ſaying unto you, is, that the reaſon why the intereſt of Prayer in the World, I mean, amongſt Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, is fallen ſo low as it is; and is in a manner ſunk in compariſon of that which it was and appeared to be in the Chriſtians of old, is, becauſe that the Spirit of love to God, that Heroick and vigorous Spirit is ſunk in the Chriſtian World: It was upon the Wing in the times of the Apoſtles, and ſome Ages after them; but now, among all pretenders to God, certain it is, that God amongſt them all finds not many faithful Friends, not many of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and uprightneſs of heart and ſoul, which was found in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians. For as God reaſoned the caſe with the Jews long ſince, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1, 2. <hi>Behold the Lords hand is not ſhortened,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>neither his ear heavy that he cannot hear.</hi> So then, this is a thing which needs be no mans doubt or queſtion, that to be great in the ſight of God, and to have his ear continually open unto a mans Prayer, muſt needs be a treaſure of comfort, and peace unto him; and ſo in conſort with thoſe three other Priviledges (formerly opened) renders a mans life and condition in the World as deſirable as God judgeth meet to permit it to be here.</p>
               <p>We further added, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>7</label> in the propoſal of the Motive yet in hand; that as <hi>a being filled with the Spirit</hi> would render a mans life in this World
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:95016:281"/>comfortable, in reſpect of the four particulars mentioned, yea, moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable: So there is no other courſe that a man can take without this, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he can do beſides, or with a neglect of this will do it, will intereſt a perſon man or woman in any, or however, not in all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars mentioned; without a joynt concurrence of which there will be ſomewhat material and of moment wanting to the compleating of their condition in the World. Let us ſpeak a few words to this alſo, and prove unto you, that without <hi>a being filled with the Spirit</hi> none of the four particulars can be <hi>enjoyed, or poſſeſſed by you;</hi> at leaſt upon any ſuch terms on which they may be, and are enjoyed by thoſe that are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Spirit, and on which the deſirableneſs of a mans life in the World is raiſed and maintained by them. Now the reaſon (briefly) why none of the great Priviledges mentioned can be enjoyed like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by any other courſe taken, or means uſed, without <hi>a being filled with the Spirit</hi> is this, becauſe they all depend upon theſe cordial and high engagements for God, and for the advancement of his intereſt in the World, of which we have lately ſpoken; and theſe are not likely to be found in any perſon, or perſons, but in thoſe only who are filled with the Spirit. So that we have theſe two things to open and ſhew unto you.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the four particulars, wherein, as we have proved, the life of a man, in this World, as to the greateſt deſirableneſs of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, are not to be had, or to be enjoyed, either <hi>deviſim,</hi> but eſpecially not <hi>conjunctim,</hi> but only by a ſignal courſe of righteouſneſs, or a very conſiderable degree of activeneſs for God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That no mans heart will ever be lifted up to ſuch a courſe of righteouſneſs as this, to ſuch an activeneſs for God, but only theirs who are filled with the Spirit of God, what courſe ſoever they may take otherwiſe. Now the truth is, that both theſe, in effect and by clearneſs of conſequence, have been proved already; The former in thoſe diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, wherein we made it appear, that every of the ſaid four Priviledges were (reſpectively) the natural and proper fruits and conſequences of the ſignal intergrity of mens hearts and waies in the ſight of God; The latter in thoſe paſſages wherein in like manner we evinced ſuch an integrity of heart and life before God to be the genuine and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate effect of a being filled with the Spirit. Therefore we ſhall here only vindicate and clear thoſe diſcuſſions and paſſages from ſuch difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or objections which may ſeem to encumber them, and to weaken the truth or authority of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, That men may attain to a freedom from all troubleſome and tormenting cares and fears, and whatever of this nature is apt to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the life of a man leſs comfortable, leſs deſirable, without any ſuch high engagements for God (as were ſpoken of) and ſo conſequently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being filled with the Spirit, appears from hence, that many Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:95016:282"/>Philoſophers, and Wiſe men, eſpecially of the Sect of the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks,</hi> by ſtudy and dealing with themſelves and their hearts effectually, from ſuch Principles and Conſiderations as the light of Nature afforded them, did attain this atchievement, they did abſolutely deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from that bondage and ſubjection we ſpeak of, and did live in a conſtant tranquillity, and ſerenity of mind and thoughts; and did not feel any pricking Thorne, or grieving Brier of any troubleſome paſſion. Yea, more generally, they of the Schole and Sect of <hi>Epicurus</hi> lived free from all cares and fears; yea, there are many amongſt our ſelves, who (as our Proverb expreſſeth it) ſet Cock on hoop, and as they put the evil day far from them, ſo together herewith they put away all care, fear, and all troubleſome thoughts to the ſame diſtance; therefore it ſeems, at leaſt one of the four Priviledges, wherein you placed the deſirableneſs of a mans life and condition in this World, <hi>viz.</hi> a freedom from all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and tormenting fears and cares may be obtained and enjoyed without a being filled with the Spirit. I reply firſt, concerning Heathen Philoſophers, theſe things; Firſt, That as Painters uſe to do very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> flatter, and give beauty and comlineſs in the artificial face, where they are wanting in the natural: So many Hiſtorians, when they have a perſon of note, or worth, or of any great name to repreſent, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, they do not ſo much ſet or bend themſelves to inform the Reader of the truth of things concerning them, as to ſhew the rareneſs of their own genius and parts, by making them the moſt accompliſhed perſons in the World. As <hi>Sophocles</hi> the Tragedian made reply to him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a reaſon, why, contrary to his Fellow <hi>Euripides,</hi> he made all Women that he perſonated in his Tragedies ſo excellently vertuous and good? I (ſaith he) repreſent them ſuch as they ſhould be: In like manner, we have great cauſe to ſuſpect that they who have reported ſuch glorious things of ſome Philoſophers, and others, worthy men (like enough in their Sphere) rather repreſented and reported them ſuch as they ſhould have been than ſuch as they were; as <hi>Paterculus</hi> (a Roman Hiſtorian (ſpeaking of <hi>Cato,</hi> ſaith of him, that he was <hi>Virtuti ſimilimus, qui rectè nunquam fecit, ut facere videretur, ſed quia aliter facere non poterat:</hi> He was a man moſt like unto virtue it ſelf, who never did that which was right that he might appear to do it, but becauſe he could not do otherwiſe; as if he were a man unchangeably perfect and good. After ſome other high Characters of commendation, he ſaith of him that he was <hi>Homo omnibus humanis vitiis immunis:</hi> A man that was far from the inſirmities of a man; with more of the ſame ſtrain. Yet that which the ſame Author reports of <hi>Scipio Aemylianus</hi> is much more, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was a man, <hi>Qui nunquam niſi laudandum, aut fecit, aut dixit, aut ſenſit;</hi> who all his life long never ſpake, nor did, nor thought any thing but that which was good. And elſewhere this is ſaid of another, <hi>Solem fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ilius e Coelo dimovendum,</hi> &amp;c. That it was a more eaſie matter
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:95016:282"/>to turn the Sun out of his way than to turn him. Therefore we are not bound to believe all that we have received by Tradition concerning the high Strains, and Heroick attainments and Enjoyments of Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and others famous for virtue; although on the other hand, there is little queſtion to be made but that there were many of excellent Principles and deportments amongſt them, and ſuch who ſhall riſe up in Judgment againſt the common ſort of Profeſſors of Chriſtianity amongſt us, and condemn them. However there is no certainty of any ſuch thing as abſolute freedom from cares and fears enjoyed by and of them, as that pretended in the Objection.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe that as far as an eſtimate can be made, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> either by ſome paſſages of ſpeech, or diſcourſe upon occaſion uttered by ſome of them, or elſe by many Sayings yet found in their Writings, that they did ſome of them enjoy ſuch a Priviledge as a freedom from cares and fears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet ſuch an eſtimate as this is far from certainty or infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Though we ſhould hear them utter ſayings, or ſpeak of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity like that of Angels, it doth not follow that they ſpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e truth. For as <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſpeaking of many excellent Principles of Temperance and Sobriety, ſaith of young men, that they uſe to ſpeak and diſcourſe of theſe things, but do not believe them: In like manner, men of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Parts may hammer out many excellent Sayings and Strains of a very high nature, and yet not believe them themſelves. <hi>David</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times indeed ſaid, <hi>I believed, and therefore I ſpake, Pſal.</hi> 116.10. but the truth is, that men may (and frequently do) ſpeak and utter many things which they do not believe. Our Engliſh Story reports of one <hi>John Crem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nſis,</hi> who was ſent over by the Pope to perſwade the Prieſts from Marrying; that the very next night after he had delivered his Meſſage, and in an eloquent Oration commended Chaſtity to the Clergy, he was found in Adultery. So that it is no great matter for men to write excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things, to talk of freedom from fears and cares, but to get this into the heart and to make this real is another manner of thing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) Though ſome of thoſe, we ſpeak of, might ſeem to enjoy ſuch a Priviledge as that formerly deſcribed of a dreadleſs and fearleſs mind, whileſt either they were free from danger, or under the arreſt of ſome evil more tolerable, and more eaſie to be born; yet when they came to encounter with the King of Fears, <hi>viz.</hi> Death, their inward ſecurity and height of confidence and reſolution was much ſhaken, and began to give in. As it is reported of <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelf, the wiſeſt, or at leaſt one of the wiſeſt men amongſt them, and withal the moſt vertuous and Worthy; who being condemned to die, and that by taking Poyſon, when he came to drink his Hemlock (for that was to be his deadly Draught) he looked pale; and yet he never did before bewray any kind of fear; but ſet his countenance ſo that he was not wont to change it. So that that fearleſneſs of Spirit which was in
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:95016:283"/>ſome Philoſophers amongſt the Heathen was not compleat, or full of power, it did not ſo reign over all formidable Enemies but that when Death made her approaches this raiſed ſome fear in them.</p>
               <p>But if it be here objected and ſaid, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> but however many amongſt them were fearleſs even of death it ſelf, as appears by the Examples and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of thoſe who voluntarily devoted themſelves unto death for the preſervation and ſafety of their Country; as the <hi>Decii</hi> amongſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; there were two of them, the Father, and the Son, who in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wars, wherein their Country was in danger, did ruſh upon the face of death. And ſo <hi>Curtius</hi> another <hi>Roman,</hi> who threw himſelf into a deep Chaſm or opening of the Earth.</p>
               <p>And ſome amongſt the Grecians alſo were men of great reſolution, as <hi>Codrus, Themiſtocles,</hi> &amp;c. and did expoſe themſelves to eminent and certain dangers of death, only for the ſafety of their Country; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch men as theſe were free from all tormenting fears and troubles. But to this we anſwer:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That none of theſe did purely, or meerly voluntarily devote themſelves unto death, but upon very great occaſions, at leaſt by them ſo apprehended, <hi>viz.</hi> for the preſervation of their Families, Wives, and Countries; ſo that to expoſe themſelves unto that which they did in this was but to chuſe the leſſer evil before the greater. So that all that can be made of the ſenſe that thoſe had of death, was, that they apprehended it far better, and more deſirable for them to loſe their lives, than that their Wives, and Families, and Country ſhould be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, To expoſe a mans ſelf to danger, or unto a certain evil, doth not prove that he is free from the fear of the evil, but only that he chuſeth and prefers this evil before the other. As when a man is under a great and eminent danger unleſs he attempts very deſperately through; if he ſhall make this attempt he is not certain he ſhall eſcape the danger he is in, only he doth ſuppoſe leſs danger of the two in that courſe which he takes or attempts: As in the caſe of the four Lepers at the Gates of <hi>Samaria,</hi> there was n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſafety for them to ſit at the Gate, there they muſt periſh; if they go into the City, there they muſt periſh like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but if they ſhould ariſe and go to the Army, they could but kill them, however in ſo doing they might eſcape. Now therefore it doth not ſhew that there was no fear in them, but that they knew there was was no poſſibility of eſcape in caſe they ſtayed at the Gate of the City.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is little queſtion but that a man may ſo go to work, and tamper with his heart and mind as quite to ſtupifie them, and make them little other than ſenſleſs, at leaſt for a time, in reſpect of any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject whatſoever; as the Scripture ſpeaks of ſome, whoſe hearts were as hard as brawn, and whoſe conſciences were ſeared as with a hot Iron. Men do ſeldom make trial of their hearts what they can bring them
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:95016:283"/>unto, and can hardly believe ſuch a Doctrine as this, <hi>viz.</hi> That men may bring their hearts to what temper they pleaſe if they will follow means that are proper to bring ſuch a thing to paſs. Now it is no waies unlikely but that theſe, at leaſt ſome of them, knew what conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were apt to make them void of fear (they being men of parts) they knew how to deport themſelves ſo, as to make themſelves fearleſs and dreadleſs. If men will attend only upon the thoughts of the excellency, and renown, and grandeur of men that have died on ſuch terms, as of <hi>Achilles, Epaminondas,</hi> &amp;c. will feed upon the beauty and deſirableneſs of their Names and Fames; and then ſhall think that they themſelves, if they ſhall do ſuch things, ſhall be as famous as they, and their names ſhall live. If this courſe ſhall be taken for any conſiderable ſpace of time, and men ſhall but add hereunto other conſiderations which are apt to render their lives in this World leſs pleaſing, and leſs deſirable, no queſtion but that they may harden their hearts, and ſtupifie their ſenſes, that they may quite quench and deſtroy all impreſſions of fear which is naturally planted within them towards ſuch formidable objects.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Very poſſibly Sathan might ſtand at the right hand of ſuch perſons, and help forward thoſe who did devote themſelves unto death; he might blow the coals of vain glory when their hearts began to work and riſe within them by caſting in his incentives. For we have heretofore ſhewed unto you he hath ſuch a kind of operation upon the hearts of men, and can joyn with their fanſies and imaginative powers, and put life into them by his injections. This may be another means by which theſe Perſons might attain unto this fearleſneſs and dreadleſneſs of ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Fifthly (and laſtly for this) Concerning that freedom from torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cares and fears, if there were any amongſt them that had part and fellowſhip in any ſuch Priviledge, upon ſuch ground as the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture might afford them, it may be thought that the Spirit of God was in the buſineſs; we may ſafely ſay, that the Spirit of God might be there, and that it was his interpoſure: For the Book of Nature is the Book of God as well as the Book of Scripture; though this latter Book hath more in it than the former, yet ſo far as that doth teach, ſo far doth God own, countenance, and fall in with it. And we know that the Scripture it ſelf doth ſpeak the truth of this; and God is the God of Order, and not of Confuſion: Therefore thoſe things which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Book of Nature do not croſs any thing written in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. The truth is, that this Book (I mean, the Book of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) is written to perfect that which is decayed, blotted, and blurred in the Book of Nature, that we might come to the knowledge of God with the more eaſe. Now, in caſe there be any who want this Book of the Scripture, and ſhall mind and conſider that other Book of God,
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:95016:284"/>the Book of Nature, which Book requires many excellent things of men as well as the Scriptures do. If they go ſo to work as they may, if they will ſtudy the works of Righteouſneſs which the Book of Nature teacheth, and fall in with him who teacheth there, that is God; and ſtill as light comes in walk up unto it, all this while here is a fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for the Spirit of God to joyn himſelf with thoſe perſons, and carry them on from leſſer light to greater. It is for his glory to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſuch perſons who make much of his motions. They that will but mind his beginnings, and his firſt breathings into their hearts and ſouls, he will preſently cauſe them to take up a new Leſſon, and will ſtill carry them forward, and cauſe them to know things more conſiderable. Now then, put the caſe that this was the ſtate of any of them, that they did attain unto any ſuch Spirit to be above fears and dread; this might be by means of the Spirit of God, which might be a kind of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit in them.</p>
               <p>If it be objected, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> But the Heathen are ſaid to be <hi>without God in the World,</hi> Eph. 2.12.</p>
               <p>To this I reply, It is true, to ſpeak of the body and bulk of the Heathen, they were indeed without God in the World; this was the ſtate of the generality of them; yet notwithſtanding the ſame Apoſtle ſaith that they knew God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21. &amp; 2.14.15. and that <hi>they were a Law unto themſelves.</hi> Now look to what degree they did thoſe things, by the Law and light of Nature, that they would have done in caſe they had had the written Law, to that degree they were a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their Conſciences either excuſed or accuſed them accordingly. Now it is uſual to ſpeak ſome things of a Body or People in the general which cannot belong or be applied to every individual or particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. As when Chriſt crucified is ſaid to be unto the <hi>Jews a ſtumbling-block,</hi> and unto the <hi>Gentiles fooliſhneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that he ſpeaks only of the generality of them; for the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf, <hi>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, we preach Chriſt the Power of God, and the Wiſdom of God.</hi> So that that which the Scriptures ſpeak concerning the Gentiles is not to be applied unto every particular, but only to the generality of them. Concerning perſons (whether they bear the name of Chriſtians or no) who by means of debauched Principles and Practices, by following Luſts and Pleaſures unſatiably, ſeem to have contracted or gained a freedom from fears and tormenting cares, the truth is, that for the moſt part they are not Inheritors, or in poſſeſſion of any ſuch freedom; it is but a Copy of their countenance under this kind of practice. There is a Worm that lies gnawing them, that ever and anon doth ſting and bite them, even in the greateſt heat of their jollity they are often ſtung. The Wiſeman ſays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.13. that <hi>even in laughter the heart is ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, and the end of that mirth is heavineſs.</hi> The end of fooliſh
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:95016:284"/>and vain jollity is heavineſs, and not only ſo, but many times it breaks out even in the midſt of it, and comes upon them as the pains of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child: which plainly ſhews that their fearleſneſs of ſpirit is not of that kind which we ſpeak of. Theſe waies and courſes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure bring but a falſe kind of joy; for their diſeaſe all this while lies hid within them feſtering. And ſo men may cauſe theſe kinds of fears to be allayed by this kind of mirth and jollity, as men may lay mud upon a Fountain, but after a while the Spring will make its way: So will the Conſcience be as a Spring of ſorrow and trouble; the Conſcience will work thorough and thorough, though they ſhould lay on one kind of Pleaſure after another; yea, though they ſhould lay on never ſo much; and it will appear in due time that theſe men are far from being parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with the Saints of God in that great and bleſſed Priviledge of being fearleſs and dreadleſs. So that we ſee that that fearleſneſs of ſpirit, which we have argued for, is an appropriate effect of our <hi>being filled with the Spirit God.</hi> And though there be ſome counterfeits of it in ſome other perſons, who are not full of this Spirit of God, yet if you take the Priviledge as we deſcribed it, take it in the richneſs of it, and in the truth and reality of it, take it as being raiſed upon good grounds, that it be not baffled with any thing that ſhall riſe up againſt it, thus it is only the effect of ſuch a ſignal Righteouſneſs as we ſpeak of, and ſome other anſwerable effects of a being filled with the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Now as the caſe is in this Priviledge, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> ſo there is the ſame reaſon of all the other three particulars; namely, that a Creature cannot inveſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in them, but only by that courſe we have ſpoken of. Joy and Peace, a ſetled Peace, an excellent ſtrain of Joy cannot be attained by any other perſon but only by him who is more excellent than his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; this is the natural reſult and product of an excellent courſe and ſtrain of Righteouſneſs and Obedience unto the Command of God. And if men ſhall attempt to raiſe it in themſelves in any other way, or by any other means, they will be diſappointed; for this kind of fruit grows from no other Tree whatſoever, it ariſeth only from an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Creature towards his God. And the truth is, that which is found in many men, and which in the Language of ſome is termed joy, is but a kind of degenerate joy. There may be joy ſo called, but that which is joy indeed is a quite different thing from it. It was the ſaying of an Heathen Philoſopher (and it is a very true Saying) that <hi>true joy is a ſevere thing;</hi> and for the maintaining of it it requireth much watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of them that are the Subjects thereof; they muſt not turn aſide to do any thing that is unworthy of it. Now therefore, when men are light and looſe in their words and actions, carried away by that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is in ſin, there is nothing of reality in their joy. You may find out ſome other name for it, or if you will you may call it Joy:
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:95016:285"/>but there is nothing of the nature or of the ſubſtance of this joy in it, which is unſpeakable and glorious; and ſo concerning that other particular, a capacity of enjoying a free and large Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God: This cannot ariſe in any mans heart without the Spirit of God, who can fill men with the knowledge of God, and impart, and communicate the ſecrets of God accordingly. Who knoweth the things of God but the Spirit of God, and he to whom the Spirit will reveal them? And our Saviour ſaith, no man knoweth the things of God but only the Son; no man knows them without manifeſtation and diſcovery of them by him. As Horſe and Mule, and other Creatures, do not, nor cannot underſtand the things of a man, becauſe they have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him in his Principles of Reaſon and underſtanding: In like manner, neither are men capable of the things of God further than himſelf doth manifeſt theſe things unto them. Indeed there is this difference between beaſts having Communion with men, and mens having Communion with God. As beaſts, they have no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with men in Principles, ſo neither are they capable of any Diſcourſe or Communication, or of receiving the light of knowledge from men: But it is otherwiſe with men in reſpect of the knowledge of God, and Communion with him; for though they have no knowledge of the things of God at the preſent, yet are they capable of the knowledge of them, if they be communicated unto them they can reliſh them and improve them. And ſo for the fourth particular (and laſt) that great intereſt in God to carry things in Prayer; this is ſuch a Priviledge that, me thinks, every man muſt acknowledge and grant, and cannot find any thing to oppoſe or object againſt it, but that this muſt be the effect of an enlargement in Righteouſneſs, and this comes by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God. For God makes a great Treaſury of his Ear; that is only open for perſons of greatneſs and worth; it is one of the higheſt means, and greateſt encouragement which God hath in his hand to work and draw up the hearts of men on high, <hi>viz.</hi> unto a life excellent in holineſs, to grant them a rich intereſt in Heaven, to have his car open to do great things for them. Now, if God ſhould grant all to other perſons that are low and of an ordinary converſation, God would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt himſelf, and ſhould make that common which he hath ſet apart for great and ſignal Services. For ſhould he grant this great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, to have his Ear open to perſons of an ordinary rate or growth in holineſs, that when they prayed unto him for great things they might obtain them at his hand, he would ſpoil his market for great things: For who are they that would ſtrive to out-run their Neighbours in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appertaining to God, if they apprehended that God would give as much intereſt in himſelf, and in his love unto them that neither labour nor ſtrive to gain it? So that there is no queſtion to be made, but that this Royal Priviledge alſo is the natural and appropriate effect and
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:95016:285"/>product of an high excellency in Righteouſneſs in the World, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſhews them that have it to be filled with the Spirit of God. Thus we have made good the truth of our Motive laſt propounded, ſo far as it concerns this preſent life, and the deſirableneſs of it; and have ſhewed and proved, that he that is filled with the Spirit of God muſt needs be inveſted in, and poſſeſſed of the four Priviledges mentioned: And ſecondly, that he that is poſſeſſed of theſe muſt needs live upon the moſt deſirable and happy terms that this World can afford. We caſt in this likewiſe additionally that this bleſſedneſs of life and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not to be obtained by any other means but by being filled with the Spirit.</p>
               <p>We now proceed to ſhew the like concerning the life which is to come, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>12</label> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> that a being filled with the Spirit in this World is that which will make a mans Crown of glory to flouriſh on his head, and this with the greateſt encreaſe of glory, in the World which is to come. Only, by the way, we ſuppoſe one thing, which I know is doubted of and queſtioned by ſome, and denied by others, but yet is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received, and (queſtionleſs) is a truth, and the Doctrine of the Scriptures themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> That as the ſtate and condition of men differ in this World, ſome live upon better and more comfortable terms than others; ſo ſhall it alſo be in the World to come: I mean, amongſt thoſe who ſhall all be happy and bleſſed, ſome ſhall be greater in bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than others, and higher in glory, though it ſhall be well with them all, and they ſhall all be happy and bleſſed. Now whereas the World to come, according to the more general and probable Opinion, is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:</p>
               <p>Firſt, That ſtate of the Saints under the Kingdom of Chriſt which is yet to come, and that condition afterwards when God ſhall be all in all, there is no eſtate between theſe two. Now take either the one eſtate, or the other, they may well be called the World which is to come; that is, a World which as it is future, ſo the ſtate and condition of it will be much different from the World that now is. That which we are about to propound unto you doth relate indefinitely unto them both, in all, and in every of the ſeveral degrees and diſpenſations of God in them. We ſhall not make any long buſineſs to argue and vindicate the truth which we now ſuppoſe as the Baſis or ground-work of the next part of our diſcourſe; partly, becauſe we would not make any long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from the main buſineſs in hand; partly, becauſe (as I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) we, not very long ſince, did argue the Point at large, giving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply both unto ſuch Scriptures, and ſuch Arguments which are generally oppoſed unto the Opinion. Therefore we ſhall at preſent only take ſome brief notice how the Scriptures ſtand enclined in the Point, and add a Reaſon or two for the confirmation of what we ſhall find the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures hold forth in the caſe; and when we have laid this foundation,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:95016:286"/>we ſhall go forward with the building. Firſt; For the Scriptures there is a great appearance here, yea (doubtleſs) more than an appearance too on the behalf of the Notion or Opinion which was lately mentioned. All thoſe paſſages wherein it is declared that God will judge every man according to his works, and ſo reward every man according to his works, ſuppoſe a difference in rewards, unleſs we ſhall ſuppoſe (that which is manifeſtly untrue) <hi>viz.</hi> that the good works of all thoſe who ſhall be ſaved are equal, and that none of them have done either more or leſs, nor that they have been more or leſs ſerviceable either unto God or men in their Generation; but that all have been found alike righteous, alike faithful, alike zealous for God. But ſuppoſing that the works of the Saints (I mean their works of righteouſneſs) are not equal, but that ſome have lifted up their hands higher unto the Commands of God than others; then theſe paſſages of Scripture clearly ſuppoſe that there will be found a variety of rewards between righteous men and righteous men. For that ſuch places of Scripture as theſe are not to be underſtood only of the kind or general quality of mens works; as if the meaning only were, that God would reward all thoſe that ſhall have wrought righteouſneſs, and who have done well with eternal life; and that he will puniſh thoſe that have done wickedly and ungodlily with eternal death; now though this be a truth, yet that this cannot be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is apparent by the Scriptures which ſpeak elſewhere, not only of both kinds of works, and the different ſpecies and kind of rewards and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenſes proper to them; but alſo that both kinds of works ſhall be recompenſed (reſpectively) with bleſſedneſs, and with torments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the meaſure and degree wherein the one have been good, and the other have been evil.</p>
               <p>This appears from ſeveral places of Scripture (as likewiſe from the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſelf, <label type="milestone">

And ſo in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. where it is ſaid of thoſe that die in the Lord, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>their works follow them.</hi> Which ſhews that their works do not only ſtand by them, or abide with them here, while they are in this life; but that when they ſhall go out of this World, then bleſſed are they that die in the Lord, for they reſt from their labours, and their works follow them, out of this World into that which is to come.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle gives this by way of Motive to preſs to good works;
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:95016:286"/>that whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, namely, in proportion; let a man do but little, and he ſhall receive but little: but let him riſe as high as he will, and be as fruitful as fruitfulneſs it ſelf can render him, he ſhall receive all and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Work, and every particular Service in proportion of reward. Know, my Brethren, there is not any of this precious Seed of glory and future bleſſedneſs loſt, there is not one corne or grain of this that ſhall rot under the clods. The Heavens are the fruitfulleſt ſoil that can be ſown in. The Seed that you ſow is the precious Seed of Righteouſneſs, and true Holineſs, and you cannot ſow too thick of this ſeed. For the Heavens are other manner of Fields than the Fields of this World: They may (indeed) be ſowed too thick with ſeed of another nature, which may hinder the fructification thereof, but you cannot ſow the Fields of Heaven ſo thick but that your harveſt will be anſwerable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34, &amp;c. our Saviour declares how, and after what manner he will entreat thoſe that have, or ſhall have miniſtred unto him in his members. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherite the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the World: For I was an hungry, and ye gave me meat,</hi> &amp;c. Our Saviour makes this the very reaſon and account which he gives unto the World, why the Saints were admitted into that Kingdom which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them (<hi>i. e.</hi> for men and women who did act in the World after ſuch a manner) becauſe they had done theſe things: namely, fed the hungry, and cloathed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the way, to give a little light unto that queſtion, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>14</label> Whether Faith alone juſtifies, or how and in what ſenſe men are juſtified by works, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Works of the Law? Whenſoever the Apoſtle is diſputing with the Jews, he treats with them according to their own ſenſe, which was, that they did expect to be juſtified by the Works of the Law, upon a riged account of their own Righteouſneſs, and that upon the merit of what they did, and that it would be unrighteouſneſs in God not to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie them upon ſuch terms. Now the Apoſtle argues that by the Works of the Law, in this ſenſe, no man can be juſtified. Juſtification is taken two waies in Scripture, either for the putting of men into a ſtate of grace and favour with God; or elſe it may be taken for that final judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or award which God will pronounce unto men in the great Day. Now, if we ſpeak of the former, this no waies depends upon the Works of the Law, nor upon any Works whatſoever, for then the bare or meer performance of ſuch Works would juſtifie men. Now the Juſtification which <hi>Paul</hi> had chiefly to do with the Jews about was the firſt of theſe juſtifications which ſtands in the remiſſion of ſins, which he deſcribes in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are covered; Bleſſed is the man,</hi> &amp;c. This doth not depend upon the Works of the Law, for without ſhedding of bloud there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. therefore Juſtification, in this ſenſe, doth
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:95016:287"/>wholly depend upon the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, and is procured by it, and derived unto the Creature which doth believe and accept of him for a Saviour. But if you take Juſtification in the ſecond ſenſe, either for Gods approbation of men, or for his final award, that he ſhall give unto men; this Juſtification doth depend wholly (upon the matter) upon mens Works, and upon their righteouſneſs. For the Sentence of that juſtification at that day ſhall be awarded unto men, not according as they have believed, but according to the righteouſneſs which they have wrought, and ſo Works are neceſſary, when it is ſaid: He that condemneth the Righteous and juſtifieth the Wicked, that both are an abomination unto the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. Now to juſtifie here (and in many other places) ſignifies to approve, or diſcharge from puniſhment; ſo that for men to approve of the wicked in their evil waies, and to diſcharge them from ſuch puniſhment which ought to be inflicted on them is an abomination to the Lord. Thus then we ſee, that what the Scriptures ſpeak concerning God's rewarding mens good works, it is not to be reſtrained to any thing they receive from him in this life; yea, if what God in the Scripture promiſeth unto worthy, and well-doing, or unto men righteous and holy, were confined to what they are like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from him in this World, all the ſervice that any mans righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or fruitfulneſs in well doing would do him, would not amount to an exempting of him from being of all men the moſt miſerable, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that paſſage of the Apoſtle lately mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

And ſo on the other hand, he that ſhall build <hi>Silver,</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> and <hi>Precious ſtones</hi> ſhall not only be ſaved, but ſhall ſuſtain no loſs or detriment in his reward, which the other ſhall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly do. <hi>Other foundation</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 11.) <hi>can no man lay,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:95016:287"/>i. e.</hi> upon any reaſonable terms or grounds. Men indeed may build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this foundation, either Silver, or Gold, or Precious Stones; or Hay, and Stubble, and rotten Wood; I mean, men may build ſuch kind of Doctrines which do hold a natural correſpondency with the foundation; or they may build ſuch Doctrines as are unſutable, and are ſo expreſſed by the terms of Hay, and Stubble, and Wood; that is, ſuch Doctrines, Notions, and Imaginations which are altogether inconſiſtent with that precious foundation Jeſus Chriſt. Now (ſpeaking of theſe things) ſaith he, <hi>Every mans work ſhall be made manifeſt, for the day ſhall declare it;</hi> and if any mans work ſhall abide the trial, he ſhall receive the full reward of it: but if any mans work ſhall be burnt (meaning, in part, not that the foundation ſhall burn;) if any mans ſuperſtructure ſhall be Hay, Stubble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſhall ſuffer loſs; his reward ſhall not be ſo large, ſo rich, and ſo great as it would have been in caſe he had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther built Hay, nor Stubble, nor Wood, but only Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones. Therefore it is clear, that there ſhall be ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence even amongſt thoſe that are Preachers and Teachers of the Goſpel, which together ſhall be ſaved in reſpect of the reward of their labours. Beſides this place there are ſeveral other expreſſions to this purpoſe; that of our Saviour in his anſwer to the Sons of <hi>Zebedeus, Mat.</hi> 20.23 clearly doth ſuppoſe that there are ſuch places in his Kingdom, places at his right hand, and at his left hand; we know it is not only the common interpretation of the place, but it is likewiſe according to the manner of all Nations, of Kings and ſupreme Governours, that thoſe that are neareſt unto them in place, and higheſt in their favour, do ſit next unto them at the right hand, and at the left. And ſo again, 2 <hi>Joh. v.</hi> 8. he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth them <hi>not to loſe thoſe things which they had gained;</hi> meaning, that they had done much good, that they had held forth the name of Jeſus Chriſt; now take heed (ſaith he) that you do not loſe the things which you have wrought, that you may receive a fall reward. Now ſuch men who ſhall hold on their way, not only when there ſhall be no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption in their way of well-doing, but alſo when troubles and temptations ſhall attend them for righteouſneſs ſake; theſe are they that ſhall not loſe what they have wrought: But for others that ſhall abate in their zeal and faithfulneſs to God, though they do not decline to that degree, but that they may be ſaved at the laſt; yet will they not receive ſo full a reward, there will not be ſo many bleſſings for them as there might have been in caſe that they had purſued without making any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10, 11, 12. Our Saviour pronounceth bleſſedneſs to them who are perſecuted for righteouſneſs ſake, <hi>Bleſſed are you when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you; and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſly for my names ſake; rejoyce and be exceeding glad</hi> (the word ſignifies, leap or dance for joy) <hi>for great is your reward in heaven.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But beſides the general vergency and leaning of the Scriptures on
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:95016:288"/>that hand we ſpeak of, there are ſeveral reaſons and grounds agreeable to the Scriptures, and to the nature of the thing it ſelf that perſwade very much that way.</p>
               <p>Firſt, If God ſhould make thoſe of his Saints, or believers that are moſt remiſs and negligent in his ſervice here on earth, equal in reward of bleſſedneſs and glory unto thoſe who have been eminently zealous, and ſignally faithfull, and have been content to ſpend and be ſpent (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) upon his intereſt and ſervice; and eſpecially if he ſhall be ſuppoſed to declare his mind accordingly unto the World; he ſhall not only want one of the greateſt Arguments and Motives to perſwade men and women unto waies that are excellent, but alſo overture ſuch a thing which would be a ſnare and temptation to fight low, and to move drowſily, heavily, and ſlowly in the courſe of Chriſtianity. For when men ſhall know and conſider, that whatſoever they ſhall do more than others of their Brethren ſhall turn to no account at all unto them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be (haply) to ſomewhat that is leſs conſiderable in this preſent World, as matter of credit, reputation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though in ſuch reſpects it is much more like to work a quite contrary way, <hi>viz.</hi> to matter of envy, hatred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When men (I ſay) ſhall underſtand that all their high acting for God, and the intereſt of his glory in the World, ſhall produce nothing of a more deſirable conſequence, or import unto them than ſeven times leſs would have done, muſt not their hand hereby be much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as to the things that are excellent?</p>
               <p>Secondly, If they who ſhall excell in righteouſneſs ſhall be but equal in reward unto thoſe who ſhall act but at an under rate therein, then it follows, that God ſhould not love Holineſs and Righteouſneſs; at leaſt that there ſhould be ſome Holineſs, or (which is the ſame) ſome degree of Holineſs which he doth not love; or at leaſt, that he ſhould love ſomething in the Creature, which yet he ſhould not reward, or (which is the ſame with all theſe) that God ſhould not love him more, who is more holy, and righteous, and conſequently more like unto himſelf than another who is leſs righteous, leſs holy, and ſo leſs like himſelf. But all theſe things are repugnant to the Nature of God. For certain it is, that if God loves righteouſneſs and holineſs ſimply, and in reſpect of their nature abſolutely conſidered, then he proportionably loves them more where they are found in any further or more eminent degree. As it was in Chriſt, <hi>Becauſe he loved Righteouſneſs, and hated Iniquity</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> with a more perfect hatred than any other of the Saints) <hi>therefore he anointed him with the oyl of gladneſs above his Fellows,</hi> Heb. 1.9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly (and laſtly) it is evident that God doth conſider the eminent ſervices of ſome men in this World, and doth eminently, and above the rate of the ordinary wages of other men, reward them here; whereas he ſuffers the like Services of other men to paſs unrewarded at preſent, at leaſt in reſpect of any rewards in the accommodations or good things
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:95016:288"/>of this World, yea, he ſuffers ſome perſons of very eminent zeal and faithfulneſs unto him, inſtead of any recompence in the former enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this World, to be w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etchedly and cruelly entreated by the World; which was the caſe of <hi>John</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ul,</hi> and of the reſt of the Apoſtles generally. It is true indeed, the caſe is ſometimes otherwiſe: God doth reward the eminent Services of his Saints with the good things of this preſent World. As in <hi>Phineas</hi> the Son of <hi>Eleazer, Abraham, Job,</hi> and ſome others. <hi>Num.</hi> 25.11, 12, &amp;c. <hi>Gen</hi> 22.16, 17, 18. <hi>Job</hi> 42.10, 11, &amp;c. Now if God ſhould highly reward the ſervices of ſome men with the ſignal bleſſings both of this World and the World to come, and ſhould reward the like ſervices of other men only with the bleſſings of the World to come, and this but the ſame in degree with the bleſſings of the other, who had a gracious conſideration likewiſe in the enjoyments of this World, and were free (at leaſt comparatively, and to a very great degree) from thoſe ſharp trials and ſufferings of the other; Should not God in ſuch Diſpenſations as theſe be hard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal?</p>
               <p>If it be here ſaid, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>17</label> But is not God at liberty to do with his own as he pleaſeth? (as it is in the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.15.) Or is not the good both of this preſent life, and the life to come, and all the degrees of either, his? And why then may he not give either an equal, or unequal ſhare and proportion to thoſe whoſe ſervices and ſufferings for him have been unequal? Or is he any waies neceſſitated to conſult the degree of mens obedience or ſervices to apportion or aſſign unto them his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards?</p>
               <p>I reply firſt, If we conſider God in the abſoluteneſs and infinity of his Nature and Being, and as undeclared unto the World in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Word, and in thoſe Promiſes, and other Manifeſtations which he hath made of himſelf in his Word unto men; doubtleſs, he is not impleadable, not liable to any mans juſt exception, in caſe he ſhould diſpoſe of his Treaſure or good things upon ſuch terms as the Objection mentioneth. For ſetting aſide the conſideration of that Covenant which he hath ſtrook with the World in Chriſt no perſon could have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable colour or pretenſe to except or contend againſt him, that the dealeth more bountifully with ſome than with others; ſuppoſing that even they, with whom he deals leſs bountifully, yet receive from him meaſure heaped up, preſſed down, and running over, above the Line of their Services or Sufferings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If we conſider God, as now having voluntarily engaged himſelf in the Covenant of grace and bounty which is contained and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Scriptures, and more particularly in the New Teſtament, in caſe he ſhall diſtribute his Rewards only according to the terms and rules here expreſſed, he may be ſaid to do with his own what he will; becauſe no man, nor other Creature, preſcribed unto him any of theſe
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:95016:289"/>Rules, no nor yet counſelled or adviſed him to preſcribe or make them but himſelf only. Therefore when (in the perſon of the Lord of the Vineyard in the Parable) he demands of him that murmured againſt him for doing as he did [<hi>i. e.</hi> for making thoſe that had wrought but one hour in the day equal unto them that had borne the heat and burthen of the day] <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do with mine own as I will?</hi> It is not neceſſary to ſuppoſe that he claims a liberty or priviledge to diſpoſe of that which is his, contrary to his revealed will, or contrary to thoſe terms, wherein he hath declared that he will diſpoſe of his own: It ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſeth, that they that contended with him about that diſpoſition of his own which he made, judged thoſe terms and rules according unto which this diſpoſition was made to be unreaſonable and unequal; and that God pleades the lawfulneſs and equity of them (and ſo the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of his proceedings, according to them in diſpoſing of his own) from this Principle in reaſon, and of common acceptation amongſt men: that it is lawful for any man to diſpoſe of that which is clearly and abſolutely his own as himſelf pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When God by Promiſe, or otherwiſe, hath declared unto the World by what Rules and Principles he purpoſeth to walk towards all mankind in the diſtributions of his rewards, in caſe he ſhould walk contrary to them he ſhould be liable unto the exceptions, and expoſtula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and cavils of men. Certainly he never doth this, doth not make diſtribution of any of his Treaſury contrary to thoſe terms which he hath declared: Poſſibly he may ſometimes ſeem to ſome one to do ſo, who doth not righly underſtand his Covenant, nor his mind and meaning therein. Now then, the Laws or Terms of the Covenant, according unto which God hath declared, and ſtill doth declare unto the World, that he will reward and puniſh men are to this effect (in the point we ſpeak of) <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>he will reward every man according to his works; that they who ſow ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly, and they that ſow liberally ſhall reap liberally.</hi> And again, that <hi>whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord;</hi> with many things of like import. Therefore now, in reſpect of thoſe bands and engagements wherein God hath voluntarily engaged himſelf he is not at liberty to do otherwiſe. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He could do nothing againſt the truth, but for the truth:</hi> So neither can God do any thing againſt himſelf, but for himſelf; he can do nothing againſt his own honour, and his own glory but only for them. And as the Maxime, or Saying amongſt men, <hi>Every man may do with his own as he pleaſeth,</hi> is to be underſtood with this Explication or Proviſo; he may do with it as he pleaſeth, <hi>viz.</hi> in a rational way, and ſo as neither to deſtroy or hurt himſelf or others: In like manner, God may do with his own what he will, ſo he doth all things for his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory. But that mentioned in the Objection, wherein it is ſuppoſed that men that are unequal in Service to God may yet be made
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:95016:289"/>equal in Rewards by him; it ſeems (at leaſt) to have a kind of appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance againſt the truth of God, and againſt thoſe Engagements and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations which he hath made concerning himſelf, and concerning his intentions and purpoſes to proceed with men in the Goſpel. You heard before that he that ſows ſparingly ſhall reap ſparingly; now if he that ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reap liberally, or have the ſame encreaſe of his ſlender ſowing which the other hath of his liberal ſowing; here would (as it were) be a blot upon the truth of God in ſuch a Saying, and in ſuch a Declaration of himſelf. And ſo when he ſaith, he that ſoweth plentifully ſhall reap plentifully, it muſt needs be underſtood compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in reſpect of him that ſoweth ſparingly: So then evident it is, ſuch a procedure of God with men as the Objection ſuppoſeth, obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the name and glory of God in the eyes of the World.</p>
               <p>Only there is one thing which we ought to be ſomewhat tender of, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>18</label> namely, how to underſtand all the Promiſes and Declarations which God hath made in this caſe of what he intends and purpoſeth to do with men; whether to underſtand them as engagements abſolutely and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally upon him, to the obſervation of which he is alwaies engaged; or (rather) whether they be only to be underſtood and taken as a courſe which he intends to follow ordinarily, and for the moſt part, and in ſtanding caſes; and that he doth rather declare what he would have men expect, what is fit and meet for them to look for at his hand, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their Services, than what he would abſolutely and univerſally bind himſelf to do. For doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hat are of the greateſt moment and conſequence, for the benefit and good of the State and Common-wealth unto which they relate; ſuch caſes may fall out wherein the Letter of the Law is better to be waved and declined than r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rn in all caſes; becauſe it is a Rule amongſt Politicians and Wiſe men that Laws are not made for all caſes whatſoever that may occur; but only for ordinary and ſtanding caſes, and ſuch which moſt frequently fall out amongſt men: So this poſſibly may be no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all to God, nor no ground of cauſing any diſrepute upon him, or diſhonour, that he doth ſometimes ſtep aſide from ſome of his Promiſes and Declarations which he hath made in this kind, if the Circumſtances under which he doth it will bear it, and do in an equitable and rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way require it at his hand. <hi>There is a time</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccl. 2.5.) <hi>to gather ſtones, and a time to cuſt them abroad;</hi> now it may be there may be ten times the proportion of the time to gather ſtones of what there may be of that time which is ſeaſonable for the throwing them abroad: yet it doth not follow but that it may be as fit that ſtones be thrown away as gathered together. So there may be ſuch caſes (I ſuppoſe it will be hard to determine the contrary, but that there may be ſuch caſes)
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:95016:290"/>wherein God may refuſe to go by his own Declarations and Expreſſions in this kind, and that without being liable to any change, or blot, or blemiſh; as if that God ſhould ſuffer his truth to fail, or that he ſhould go contrary to his Word. It is true, when the Apoſtle ſaith of him, he is a God that cannot lie, it doth not therefore follow that he doth alwaies literally perform what he ſaith; becauſe that is not his meaning alwaies ſo to do; we are not ſo to take his Promiſe, nor is it ſo to be underſtood, but only of ordinary caſes, and where there is not ſome ſpecial inducement, one or other, of greater conſequence to cauſe him to leave it, and to walk on the other hand of it. Now by all that we have argued upon this Point, we may ſee clearly, that as far as we can eſtimate in like caſes, God will reward equally thoſe that ſhall be equal in their ſervice, and unequally thoſe who ſhall be unequal in that ſenſe; and that he hath in readineſs Crowns of glory of different weight and brightneſs, according as he ſeeth and beholdeth that men and women do either fall or continue low in their Service, or elſe as they grow, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and riſe: God (I ſay) hath Crowns of glory to fit, and to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer according to the Rules of his own proportion and equity, Rules of his own drawing up and making; he hath rewards commenſurable to every mans caſe, and to every mans faithfulneſs, and zeal in his Service.</p>

                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. a paſſage of Scripture which ſeems to croſs and thwart this Opinion of variety of Rewards in Heaven. They that are contrary minded to us in the Point in hand underſtand, that by the Penny here, which is ſaid to be given to the Labour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, is meant Eternal Life and Salvation. Others (upon a better ground) are of a contrary Judgment, and do not ſuppoſe it neceſſary that we ſhould ſo underſtand it. And there are ſome that are divided in their judgments about it; who yet agree in this, that Eternal Life and Salvation is not ſignified by it. Touching the Parable, I clearly find from the words of Chriſt which went before in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. the laſt words, <hi>But many that were laſt ſhall be firſt,</hi> that the intent of it was only to make good, or to declare in an Inſtance or Type the truth of what the Lord Chriſt had ſaid that the firſt ſhould be laſt. And indeed it is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Scope of the Parable that is to be minded; and all particular clauſes and carriages in it are not to be applied unto any ſpecial thing. As it is with many of your Maps, there are the Places, and the Cities, and Diſtances of them; theſe are only the Scope of the Maps; but there are many things by way of Ornament beſides to make them pleaſant to the eyes: So I conceive, our Saviour doth frame moſt of his Parables only with one edge, as it were to fit and ſute the buſineſs which he aims at, and which he ſeeks to convey, and ſtick in the minds and conſciences of the Hearers: But there are many Paſſages and Sayings in ſeveral Parables which have no ſpecial and particular relation unto the main end, but only to ſet off
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:95016:290"/>the Parable, and to make that, as it were, more fit for the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and pleaſant to the apprehenſion, and more convenient to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away by the memories of men: And ſo we may conceive that the main ſcope of the Parable is only this, to ſhew that men, who ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their terms, with a miſtaken conceit of themſelves, and of their Services (as the Jews did) are out of the way. And this our Saviour would teach them by the Parable, when he ſaith they that were hired in the morning early contracted with the Houſholder for ſo much for their days work, which is ſaid to be a Peny: But for the reſt who were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the work afterward we do not find any Contract or mention made of what the Houſholder ſhould give them, or what they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for what they do, but only he tells them in the general what was meet for them ſhould be given them; he bids them go and labour, and do their work faithfully, and that then they ſhould receive accordingly. Now when he comes to account with theſe workmen, he begins with thoſe that were hired in the Morning, and then with the reſt that came later, and then with the laſt that came at the Eleventh hour. When the firſt ſaw that there was as much given unto thoſe that had laboured but one hour of the day as there was unto them that had borne <hi>the heat and burthen of the day;</hi> this cauſed them to break out againſt the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder that had hired them, as if he were unequal, unreaſonable, and unjuſt in giving more unto ſuch as had laboured leſs, as they judged it, and leſs to them who had laboured more (the proportion of their labour conſidered.) Now Chriſt ſhews, that this might very well be in the Kingdom of Heaven; that is, in the buſineſs of the Goſpel, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that in the World; that God may juſtly, and upon his own terms, though he would not account with ſuch Murmurers and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellers about his terms; yet that God was at liberty to make what Law or Terms he pleaſed for the diſpoſal of his own, and to walk by this Rule accordingly; that this was juſt and equal, and there was no cauſe to contend with him, or to murmur againſt him for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>But it may be ſome mans Queſtion, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>20</label> But how could any ſuch Terms or Rules be equal for God to proceed by, to make theſe equal in reward who laboured but one hour with thoſe that laboured many (and as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves pleaded their own cauſe) that had borne the heat and burthen of the day?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, That God doth not ſimply and barely eſtimate the external Actions and Services of men, but doth lay together, and puts into the balance (whatſoever it may be) the inward frame of the heart and ſoul. And ſo we find in Scripture, that when mention is made of the righteouſneſs of God in judging of men, it is ſaid, that he will judge men according to their works; and bring forth every ſecret thing to judgment. That which will bear ſpecial weight in the judgment of God is the frame of the heart and ſpirit, which it may be ſome had not
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:95016:291"/>the opportunity fully and thoroughly to expreſs in their outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments and ſervice in the World; but when God comes to paſs Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and to give Judgment, then he will eſtimate things according to the ſtricteſt and accurateſt terms of reaſon. But our Saviour, in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſets forth the high preſuming nature of the Jews, in oppoſition to the Gentiles, whom they deſpiſed, and who at the Eleventh hour of the day were called into the Service of God. He there ſets forth their Genius and Diſpoſition, who becauſe they had done ſo much, and had been ſo laborious above others in the Works of the Law, and in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and Sacrifices, and in the legal Rites and Obſervations; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thought they ſhould have double and trebble, and a thouſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold above the Gentiles, that came in ſo late. Now the Lord Chriſt declares unto the Jews, Parabolically, that he knew the frames of their hearts, how they were much expecting and looking for rewards from him for what they did upon the account of themſelves; but intimates that the Gentiles were content to ſubmit to the good will and pleaſure of God; that they came in to ſerve him freely, without indenting, or any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular contracting with him, after the manner which it ſeems the Jews did. Upon this account he makes equal the performance and Services of the Gentiles, though it was not of ſo long a continuance. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles had not been ſo long in his Vineyard as they had been, yet the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſerved him with a better heart and more ingenious mind and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons than the Jews did; which they ought to have conſidered, and not ſo much to have ſtood upon their ten thouſands of Rivers of Oyl, their Sacrifices, and Legal Obſervations, as to contend with God for a reward in rigour of Juſtice. That by the Peny is not here meant Eternal life, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> of old, and ſundry later Interpreters, have ſufficiently proved from hence; namely, that they who come in at the firſt hour of the day, that is, the murmurers, and thoſe whoſe eyes were evil becauſe God was good, that envied at the bounty and magnificence of God towards the poor Gentiles, that ſuch perſons are not like to receive the Kingdom of Heaven, Salvation from the hand of God. Or if we ſhould, in the laſt place, underſtand by the Peny here the Kingdom of Heaven, or Salvation it ſelf, yet would it not follow from thence, that therefore all theſe workmen had all the ſame part, and the ſame portion there, or the ſame degrees in glory. Becauſe as when it is ſaid, that the Righteous ſhall ſhine as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; though they ſhall be all equal in this that they ſhall all ſhine as the Sun; yet it doth not follow that they ſhall all ſhine with the ſame luſtre and ſplendor and brightneſs, but that there may be different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſhining: So it may be ſaid, that all thoſe perſons, even they that were men of an evil eye, and were apt to murmur and grudge, at them who they thought were inferiour unto themſelves, and had not been ſo long in the Service of God as they; ſuppoſing, I ſay, that thoſe
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:95016:291"/>perſons ſhould be ſaved as well as the other, yet it doth not follow, that therefore there ſhould be no difference between the one and the other, for every one may have his Peny if we underſtand Salvation by it; for all the Saints, and all Believers that have the leaſt Faith, and the loweſt degree in Grace as well as the higheſt, they ſhall all be ſaved: But it doth in no wiſe follow from hence, becauſe they ſhall receive every man a Peny, that therefore they ſhall each one receive no greater proportion than the other. I ſay, it hinders not, but that there may be degrees, and greater proportions and ſhares in this Salvation to be conferred upon ſome above what ſhall be given or conferred upon other. So that the truth is, though this Parable be very hard and obſcure, and accordingly hath tried the Judgments and Underſtandings of men, and divided them to purpoſe: Yet there is nothing can reaſonably be brought from it, which hath any clear or pregnant Argument againſt that inequality of rewards which we have been arguing until now. So that we ſhall take this for a ground or Baſis of that Diſcourſe which we are upon, That certainly there is a variety and difference of Rewards in Heaven; there are Crowns, ſome greater and more weightier than others. Now this we ſhould have added in the cloſe, that the Crowns of greateſt weight and glory are prepared for the heads of thoſe who are filled with the Spirit of God; theſe are the perſons that ſhall be higheſt and neareſt unto Jeſus Chriſt in his glory, they that ſhall moſt abound in the work of the Lord, they that are fulleſt of Zeal and Faithfulneſs, they that will make the greateſt diſpoſure of themſelves, that ſhall be content to ſpend, and be ſpent upon the intereſt of God in the World: certainly, if there be any Crowns of Glorie in the World to come more weighty than others, they are the perſons that ſhall receive them from Chriſt. Now it only remains that we weigh the Motive, and for that I ſhall refer you to the conſideration of what hath already been delivered in this Motive.</p>
